   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Seeking the Things Which Are Above</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 3:1-3 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above....Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul began with the cross and ended with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are citizens of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should not care for the things on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we pay attention to what we should not touch, taste, or handle, we are setting our mind on the things of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul went on to tell us that we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we are in resurrection, we should seek the heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we take care of the heavenly things, earthly problems will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Christian should set his mind only on spiritual and heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He should not set his mind on what he should not eat, touch, or handle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ASCETICISM BEING A TEACHING OF DEMONS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians should not pay attention to asceticism, because this is an error; it will introduce heathen doctrines into the Christian fold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must deal with it in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should read 1 Timothy 4:1-3, which says, "In later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to...teachings of demons...who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also is asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Asceticism will be greatly revived toward the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men of one age may be materialistically inclined, but the next age will react against materialism and extol asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is asceticism?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the forbidding of marriage and the abstinence from foods.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are things invented by the ascetics.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They try to eliminate food and sex.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Asceticism will come back to us in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>V. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HUMAN NATURE AND HUMAN LUST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Christians we must understand the difference between human nature and human lust.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us briefly cover these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. The Urge Being from God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God ordained that man should have food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also gave man the urge for food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The urge for food was not a sin in the beginning, nor was it a lust.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man has the urge for food, and he eats to preserve his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God wants man to preserve his life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, when He gave food to man, He also gave man an urge for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has no intention that man take his food without the sense of taste; He likes man to have enjoyment while he eats.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our enjoyment of food preserves and sustains our life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, God gave man the urge for sex for the purpose of reproduction and the continuation of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God gave man such an urge so that it would be a joy for man to continue human life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please remember that no element of sin is involved in the urge for food or the urge for sex.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Genesis 2 these things had nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even today they have nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be clear about God's view concerning these urges.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are urges created by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. What Lust Is</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is lust?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I am hungry, I may eat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The enjoyment of that food, however, is not related to lust, but to the urge for food.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if I have no food and I try to steal from others because I am hungry, that is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Or if I have food and indulge myself in the food, that also is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The desire for food is an urge, while the intention to steal food or the wanton indulgence in food is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a difference between an urge for food and a lust for food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Urge is the desire to eat; one feels happy while he eats.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lust is the intention to take food by stealing in a wanton way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As Christians we eat when food is available and do not eat when food is not available.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not only should we not steal; we should not even have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the teaching of Matthew 5, which says that we should not have any lust for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It says that we should not even have any thought for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, I enjoy good food when it is available.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is related to the urge for food.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This urge was created by God and is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When does a problem arise?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It arises when I have nothing to eat and I see food.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I try to steal, my urge for food becomes a lust for food.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I start thinking about stealing, that is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This lust comes from my urge for food.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Lust is simply the expression of one's urge to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Old Testament says, "Thou shalt not steal" Exo 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But in the New Testament, when Christians are hungry and without food, they should not only refrain from the act of stealing; they should not even have the thought of an such act.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the principle of Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Old Testament forbids the act of stealing, whereas the New Testament forbids the thought of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Stealing is lust, while the thought of stealing also is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The same principle applies to the urge for sex.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is something that pertains to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>While eating and drinking preserve the life of an individual, sex extends the life of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some people in the world steal when they have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At least they contemplate stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others indulge themselves in food.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Both are lust.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is always the possibility that an urge for food and an urge for sex can turn into lust.</S>
