In the winter of the same year, some of the brothers and pioneers came to develop the area. They built straw shelters on the land they purchased and established a new village&mdash;Ji (Christ) xin (Faith) Chun (village). The meetings began at that time. In the winter of the next year, they built a straw building for the meetings and established the meeting hall.</p><p>Name: The Christian Assembly in Jixin Village</p><p>Address: Jixin Farm, Yangshuchiao, Yiyang, Kiangsi</p><p>Began meeting: November 1941</p><p>Began remembering the Lord: April 1947 (We still have not formally established the Lord's table.)</p><p>Native origin: Shaoshing and Xiaoshan, Chekiang</p><p>Occupation: Farmers</p><p>Present number: Males: 69; Females: 54</p><p>Number in the meetings: Males: 44; Females: 33</p><p>Present number in the table meetings: Males: 16;</p><p> Females: 16</p><p>Names of leading brothers: Hsu Xiu-gen, Chou Yuan-lung, He Chai-gen</p><p>Neighboring denominations: In Yiyang&mdash;China Inland Mission; in Zhaobin&mdash;China Inland Mission outpost (fifteen li from our village) has already stopped.</p><p>Nearby transportation: Fifteen li from the Yiyang Station of the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railroad; Kiangsi-Chekiang Highway is on the eastern side (passing through Yangshuchiao); two li from a river port on the west.</p><p>Education: We began a night school in the spring of this year (two hours every night).
