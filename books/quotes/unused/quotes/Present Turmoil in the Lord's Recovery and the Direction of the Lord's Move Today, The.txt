Lord, we thank You for Your anointing, the holy ointment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, which is always anointing us
Lord, we thank You that in Your sovereignty we are here and are gathered here into Your dear and precious name
We do not agree that Your time would be wasted, so we pray that every minute will be under a proper and thorough fellowship with You
After only three days they had their first occasion of turmoil, in Taberah, where the children of Israel were murmuring evil
Later, Miriam and Aaron, Moses' elder sister and brother, rebelled by speaking against Moses because he had married a Cushite woman
Because of their rebellion, Miriam became leprous and had to be quarantined for seven days so that this leprosy would not spread
In chapter sixteen, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rose up with two hundred fifty leaders of the assembly to oppose Moses
Following this threefold punishment, God commanded each tribe to bring a rod, and He commanded Moses to lay them before the testimony
Although it is understandable why Moses became angry his word and attitude toward the children of Israel issuing from his anger offended God
By the time of Numbers 26, God had gained a new people, a people who had been purged by God's judgments through His divine dealings
According to our point of view, turmoil is not very good, but according to our real situation, turmoil is needed
In verse 30 he said that men would rise up from among them to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
The article goes on to indicate that the meeting on Ball Road in Anaheim is no longer a local church, because it has lost its ground
Many words that have come out of those who are participating in this rebellion should be considered as 'perverted things'
If we are considering ourselves all the time in this way, we are unable to take care of problems in the Lord's recovery
When we have a pure, genuine, and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, we are qualified to take care of the problems
The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body
The proper and common fellowship of the Body is without any private circle, without any party spirit, and without any hidden secrecies
In Acts 15 a proper, open conference with the leading ones took place in Jerusalem to consider the matter of circumcision and the faith
It was a big problem among the churches at Paul's time, but the brothers did nothing secretly, and they did not form parties
Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem in order to have a proper fellowship with the elders and the other apostles
To do something behind a person's back or in a small group by way of conspiracy is absolutely devilish and very evil
As children of the light , we should keep everything in the light, not doing anything in darkness or in secrecy
To avoid twisting the Scriptures, we must be very objective in our realization of any portion of the holy Word
To avoid the mixing in of any human ideas, we must reject our natural thoughts, our natural learning, and our natural doings
To avoid having any element of tradition, we need to be under the light of the pure revelation of the holy Word
We should work for the Lord within His measure , but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory
In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one's work mingled with others' work
The effect of Peter's work was realized in Corinth , and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there
If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem
If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition
If they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts
At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first ; then Paul's name began to be mentioned first
The other writers did not use this term or the term economy, because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul
After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey
Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey
Barnabas should have submitted to Paul's way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson
Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this, he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry
The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list
Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles-the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul
According to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost , he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias
Another great divisive factor in the past has been the negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord's recovery
In the elders' training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord's recovery
In the past three years of rebellion, a few brothers condemned that letter and even said that a part of that letter is heretical
The present turmoil among us is not a matter of right or wrong but an issue and a full manifestation of this negligence
In the same way, in our situation there has been a certain amount of accumulation of unpleasant things over a number of years
In principle, turmoil and problems among the Lord's people come from two sources, a human source and a satanic source
In spite of the turmoil, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, most of the churches around the globe are still going on positively
The reports of their present situation, given by their elders who were present in the elders' meetings, are quite encouraging
These reports are printed separately as a book entitled The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World
What is He carrying on today on this earth to complete His work for His eternal economy that is to build up the organic Body of His Christ
To offer up spiritual sacrifices to God is to bring the saved sinners as sacrifices for us to offer to our God
The priests in the Old Testament offered types of Christ Himself, but today we offer saved sinners as parts of the Body of Christ
We need to encourage all the saints to feed the new believers, the Lord's lambs, by having meetings in their homes
The last crucial matter that the Lord is recovering today is the prophesying by all the saints, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14
Brother Watchman Nee saw this matter more than fifty years ago, and he spoke of this in his book The Normal Christian Church Life
In verse 3 of that chapter we are told that to prophesy is to speak to men building up and encouragement and consolation
To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His Divine Trinity for His full expression
To prepare the bride as the counterpart of the Bridegroom for the eternal marriage of the redeeming God with His redeemed
To bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life for Gods eternal administration in the fulfillment of His eternal economy
The direction of the Lord's move today is, third, to bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life, which is Christ
