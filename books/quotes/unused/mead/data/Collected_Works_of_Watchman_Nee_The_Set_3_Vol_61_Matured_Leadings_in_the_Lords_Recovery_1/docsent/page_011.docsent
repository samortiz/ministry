   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Kaung, is there something that you want to say?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Kaung: I do have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you do not have to be limited to my question.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can cover as wide a scope as possible in your answer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there are many contradictions in my personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, I do not believe I am very active in my thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, I do think quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now I am learning to read the Bible continuously without trying to think too much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, I feel that I am not that much on fire for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Watchman Nee: There is a big difference between accepting and not accepting God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human power is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man does not have an unlimited capacity to think.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes your thinking can bring you to a dead end; you hit the wall and do not know how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason you feel this way is that you have exhausted your mental energy without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man spends too much time on one thing, he will not have time to think about other things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason we repeatedly emphasize the need for the outer man to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often the problem with thoughts is not in the mind but in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because the heart controls the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Proverbs 4:23 says, "Keep your heart with all vigilance,/For from it are the issues of life."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can say that our heart represents our very self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A man's thoughts are directed by his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we say that a man has a problem with his thoughts, we are actually saying that he has a problem with his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A bad heart is the cause of sickness in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not help to deal with the thoughts alone; this will only take care of the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The basic solution is to deal with the root.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once the heart is right before God, the thoughts are right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of our regeneration, we were given a new heart and a new spirit by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new heart gives us a new life and new inclination to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But through neglect, our heart sometimes becomes evil again; it loses its purity before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our heart controls our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the heart goes astray, the thoughts follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rash words are unhealthy, but in reality it is not the words themselves that are unhealthy; rather, it is the heart that is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some sisters realize that their words are not right; they try to deal with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it is not enough for one to merely hate his or her own words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is useless to try to deal with words per se.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a sister must be willing to deal with her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once her heart is dealt with, the problem with her speaking and her words will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same can be said about our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A little leaf can block the ray of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A little sin can cover up God's light and turn the heart astray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once the sin of the heart is dealt with, everything will fall into place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mind is controlled by the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible for the heart to be in one condition and the mind to be thinking about something different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After one's heart has been dealt with, he has to learn to control his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A servant of God must have a high power of concentration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He cannot waste his thoughts carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Miss M. E. Barber once said, "When Satan takes over our thought life, he takes over our whole life." There is a limit to the amount of mental energy we can expend.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we allow our thoughts to wander and roam unchecked, we will find that we cannot focus our mind when we are called to serve in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan will seize the opportunity to inject fiery darts into our mind through the outward events.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will fall into Satan's hand and be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our outer man is not broken, we will always react to outward stimuli.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will feel that thoughts are always frustrating us and that we are always being drained away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we try to serve as a minister of the word, we will find our thoughts failing us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will fail not because we have too much to say and do not know how to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will fail because our thoughts are too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not think that our problem is that we are not smart enough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The real reason is that our outer man is not broken and our mind is not under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After we bring our thoughts into focus, there is still a need to get into the thoughts of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The breaking of the outer man enables us not only to focus our thoughts but also to enter into the burden of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we have not touched the burden of the Spirit, all our thoughts summoned together will not qualify us to be used by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once the outer man is broken, there is no more self activity or subjective thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we can touch the burden in the Spirit, and the life and power contained in God's Word will flow out through our speaking.</S>
