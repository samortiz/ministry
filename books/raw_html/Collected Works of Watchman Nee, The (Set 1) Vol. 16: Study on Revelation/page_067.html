<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Revelation 18:9</H2><P>"And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning." </P><P>The kings of the earth have no strength to help the woman. This judgment is God's doing, and they can do nothing. In 17:16 the harlot is burned, and here in 18:9 the city is also burned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Revelation 18:10</H2><P>"Standing afar off because of fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city, for in one hour your judgment has come!"</P><P>"Woe, woe." This is spoken by the kings. "Woe, woe" is spoken three times in this chapter, in verses 10, 16, and 19.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Revelation 18:11</H2><P>"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore."</P><P>Many people say that because of its geographical location, Rome cannot be a commercial center, but note what is said in verse 11. This city is not a center of import and export. She only buy things but does not sell, because Antichrist lives there luxuriously.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Revelation 18:12-13</H2><P>"Cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood and brass and iron and marble, and cinnamon and amomum and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargo of horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men."</P><P>There are seven kinds of merchandise mentioned here: (1) precious substances; (2) fabrics; (3) vessels; (4) spices; (5) delicious foods; (6) sheep, horses, and chariots; and (7) slaves and souls of men. Slaves and souls of men may be translated bodies and souls. There was a famous saying that went, "Among what Babylon keeps, the first is gold and the last is souls."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Revelation 18:14</H2><P>"And the ripe fruits of your soul's lust have gone away from you, and all the sumptuous and splendid things have perished from you; and men will find them no more at all."</P><P>In this verse she is told of her past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Revelation 18:15-16</H2><P>"The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearl."</P><P>"Woe, woe." This time it is spoken by the merchants. Compare this with 17:4; the two verses match each another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Revelation 18:17</H2><P>"For in one hour such great wealth has become desolate! And every ship captain and everyone sailing to a place and sailors and all who work on the sea stood afar off." </P><P>"For in one hour...has become desolate." This is a continuation of the preceding verse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Revelation 18:18-19</H2><P>"And cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city? And they cast dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, by which all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her wealth, for in one hour she has become desolate!"</P><P>"Woe, woe." This time it is spoken by the ship captains, all the passengers on the ships, and the sailors.</P><P>"In one hour." This expression is mentioned three times in this book: (1) by the kings (18:10), (2) by the merchants (v. 17), and (3) by the ship captains, all the passengers on the ships, and the sailors (v. 19).</P>
