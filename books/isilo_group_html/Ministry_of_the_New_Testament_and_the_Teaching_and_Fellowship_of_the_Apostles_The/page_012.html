In the apostles' time there were two major heresies. One, the heresy of the Cerinthians, said that Christ was not God (1 John 2:22), and the other, the heresy of the Docetists, said that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh as a man (4:2-3). The Bible reveals clearly that Christ is a God-man. As a God-man, He has divinity, the divine nature, and He also has humanity, the human nature. According to the writings of John, at his time there were a number of antichrists who opposed the truth concerning Christ's divine and human person. One group of antichrists did not believe that Christ was a human being, and the other group did not believe that Christ was a divine being. Thus, both Christ's deity and Christ's humanity were rejected.</P><P>The apostle John charged the saints and the churches to reject this kind of person. When this kind of person who has gone beyond the proper teaching of Christ and does not abide in it comes to us, we must reject him. According to 2 John 10, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him, for if we greet him, we will participate in his sin (v. 11). This is an exclusion from the fellowship among the saints in the Body of Christ.</P><P>The person who went beyond the teaching of Christ in the apostles' time is like today's modernists, who do not believe that Christ is God. They say that Christ is merely a good man. Furthermore, they do not believe that Christ's death was for redemption. They say that Christ's death was merely a suffering of martyrdom because of His teaching. In ancient times such persons were there already. This kind of person must be rejected by the church from the church's fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions and Causes of Stumbling Contrary<br>to the Teaching of the Apostles</H2><P>Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching of the apostles. We must turn away from anyone who makes divisions and should not contact such persons to fellowship with them. This is another exclusion from the fellowship in the Body of Christ.</P><P>Some say that the apostle's charge to deal with the divisive ones in Romans 16:17 should not be applied to the division-makers in the Lord's recovery today. They say that Romans 16:17 refers to men who do not serve our Lord, but their own stomach, as mentioned in the next verse, and that the division-makers in the Lord's recovery today are not this kind of person. But we need to realize that in Romans 16:17 the apostle condemns the action of making divisions, regardless of what kind of person makes the divisions. A brother may be very right in every regard as a Christian, but if he makes divisions in the church or among the churches, he should be condemned and quarantined as the apostle charged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Refusing the Factious (Sectarian) Man Who Causes Divisions by Forming Parties in the Church according to His Own Opinion</H2><P>Titus 3:10 tells us to refuse the factious (sectarian) man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinion. In order to maintain the one fellowship of the apostles in the church, a factious, divisive person should be rejected, after a first and second admonition. This is done to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church's profit.</P><P>Some say that in Titus 3:10 "a factious [sectarian] man" should be translated "a man who teaches heresy" and that this expression does not refer to a divisive person. But in Greek this expression denotes a person who holds an opinion or a different doctrine that tends toward division. Thus, the English versions translate this as (1) a factious man&#151;American Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, Marshall's Interlinear Greek-English New Testament; (2) a man who is factious&#151;Revised Standard Version, Amplified Bible; (3) a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions&#151;Amplified Bible; (4) a heretical person causing divisions&#151;Wuest; (5) a sectarian&#151;W. J. Conybeare; (6) a man who causes divisions&#151;R. F. Weymouth; (7) a factious person&#151;James Moffatt; (8) a sectarian man&#151;Concordant Literal New Testament, Berry's Interlinear Greek-English New Testament; (9) a factious person&#151;Berkeley Version; (10) a heretical man, i.e., one given to "lift up" opinions, sound or unsound, and an unstable, unsettled individual who wishes to form sects&#151;Young's Translation; (11) causing division by a party spirit, factious&#151;Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words; (12) a divisive person&#151;New International Version. Most of the above translations are authorities.</P><P>In the New Testament we can find at least these four kinds of exclusions of Christians from the fellowship in the church, the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Ministry of the New Testament and the Teaching and Fellowship of the Apostles &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
