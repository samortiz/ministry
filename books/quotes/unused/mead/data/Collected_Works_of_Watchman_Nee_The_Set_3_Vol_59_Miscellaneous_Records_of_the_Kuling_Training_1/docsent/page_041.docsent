   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAWLESSNESS OF HAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we will mention a few clear cases of lawlessness in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are all familiar stories to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, consider the rebellion of Ham against Noah, which is found in Genesis 9:20-27.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This passage gives a record of the first slave in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we read it, we will find out how slavery came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Noah took the lead to do something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He drank of the wine in the vineyard, became drunk, and was naked in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Noah's younger son, Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness in the tent and went out and told his two brothers, Shem and Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As far as the fact is concerned, Noah had disgraced himself; he should not have become drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there was a spirit of rebellion in Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not remain under his father's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he saw his father's mistake, he went out and told his brothers immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ham did not see how serious authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not see that his father was his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man should not be tempted in his words or deeds to trespass against God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should not give up his fear of God or his respect for deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Rebellious Man Rejoicing</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>in the Humiliation of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A fleshly person always rejoices in the humiliation of deputy authority, and the one with a rebellious spirit will always rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The absence of authority means freedom for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason so many people enjoy seeing authority fall into disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ham was Noah's son; he was put under Noah's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After Noah became drunk and naked, Ham was tempted to rejoice and make fun of his father's stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He immediately went to his two brothers and told them about their father's action.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that he had a spirit of rebellion within him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first result of the flesh's rebellion against authority is a disrespectful attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The next result is transgression in words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ham was rebellious in his attitude; he enjoyed seeing authority in disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he saw his father's humiliation, he went out and told his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His brothers, however, were different in attitude; they did not rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They considered it a grievous, sad, shameful, and dishonorable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, walked backward, and covered the nakedness of their father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They did not see the nakedness of their father because they walked backward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Result of Rebellion Slavery Forever</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Noah woke from his sleep, he found out what his younger son had done, and he prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the first recorded prophecy of man in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Noah's prophecy both Shem and Japheth were blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our Lord Jesus was a descendant of Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, Shem ushered in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blessing which Japheth received related to expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the past two thousand years the spreading of the gospel has been done mainly through Japheth's descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Japheth ushered in the preachers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ham, however, received the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His son Canaan was to be a slave to Shem and Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result of rebellion to authority is perpetual slavery and perpetual subjection to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The beginning of slavery in the Bible is with Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being a slave means being under others' authority and losing one's freedom perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to see that the first man, Adam, fell through disobedience to God's word and by acting according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the flood Noah became drunk and exposed his nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this incident exposed Ham's rebellion, and he came under a curse which lasts even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first person to be cursed after the flood was Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have a heavy burden within me to say a word to everyone here: If we aspire to serve the Lord, we all must allow the Lord to bring us to a point where we experience authority in a drastic way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to allow God's authority to cut through our whole being, even our very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to meet authority in a drastic way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a person only sees Noah as a man and nothing else, he has not touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if a person touches the authority behind Noah, he will not be rash and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to touch authority before our service to God will be acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot serve God under the principle of lawlessness or in the spirit of lawlessness.</S>
