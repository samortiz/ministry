<h2 class=head2>The Lord Coming on “That Day,” the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>In verses 19 to 20 the Lord goes on to say, “Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” That day is the day of resurrection, not the day of His second coming in the future.<p>To understand the meaning of that day, it is sufficient to look at other passages in this same Gospel. John 16:16-17 says, “A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me. Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father?” In verses 20-23 Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world. Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you. And in that day you will ask Me nothing.” The disciples wept and lamented at the time the Lord was crucified, but their sorrow was turned into joy when the child was delivered on “that day,” the day of resurrection. The disciples were then like a woman travailing in birth, and Christ was the child to be brought forth in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4).<p>Chapter twenty also speaks of that day. Verses 19 and 20 say, “When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced at seeing the Lord.” This portion of the Scriptures is the fulfillment of the word spoken by the Lord in chapters fourteen through sixteen. The Lord came back on “that day,” the day of resurrection.<h2 class=head2>Christ in Resurrection Breathing into and Remaining in the Disciples</h2><h2 class=head3>Sending the Disciples by Being in Them</h2><p>Verse 21 says, “Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” In what way did the Father send the Son? The Father sent the Son by being in the Son. Now the Son was sending His disciples in the same way, that is, by being in them. Therefore, verse 22 continues, “And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.” By breathing into them, He Himself as the Holy Spirit came into them. The Holy Spirit is the very breath that the Lord breathed. The Lord seemed to be saying, “I send you by breathing into you. This is the way the Father sent Me; He sent Me with Himself. When I was sent by the Father, I had the Father within Me, and He was one with Me. Now I send you in the same way; that is, I am entering into you to be one with you.” After He said this, He breathed the Holy Spirit into them. That breath was simply Christ Himself.<h2 class=head3>Remaining with the Disciples in a Mysterious, Wonderful Way</h2><p>After saying this, the record in John 20 does not say that the Lord Jesus left the disciples. This portion of the word tells us three times that He came (vv. 19, 24, 26), but not once do chapters twenty or twenty-one say that Jesus left the disciples. Rather, He remained in them as the living breath. Therefore, wherever they were, He was there also. If they were in the room, He was in the room also. If they were at the seashore, He was at the seashore too (ch. 21). It is not that the Lord left them but that He was either invisible or manifested. Even without appearing to manifest Himself, He was still there.<p>After His resurrection, Christ came to His disciples in order to come into them. This transpired while the doors and windows were closed because at that time the disciples were in fear of the Jews (20:19). Although the doors and windows of the room were shut, Jesus came in. It seems that He must have come as the Spirit, but He showed them His hands and His side (v. 20). This indicates that He still had a physical body. How could He with a physical body enter the room with the doors closed? This is something wonderful which is beyond our understanding. We cannot understand in a full way how He came, but the fact is that after He resurrected, He came back to the disciples. Moreover, there is no word here that tells us that He left again. Rather, after He came, He remained there in a wonderful way. His coming, His presence, is very mysterious, wonderful, and beyond our understanding. We should not try to analyze it and understand it by our natural mentality; we should simply receive the word of John 20.
