   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING BEING THE GREATEST NEED OF THE CHURCH TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must see that all that matters is whether or not we have been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not a question of giving messages, nor is it a question of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, it is a question of whether or not there is a group of people who have been built by God into a spiritual habitation in which God can dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When people come into the midst of such a group, they not only sense the presence of God but also feel the warmth that is there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, they feel that such a place is their spiritual home, a place in which they can rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, is this the condition of the place where you are, the place where you meet?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it is not, then the place where you are definitely lacks building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that these words are enough to show us that today what is needed most in every place is a builded church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today in any major city there are thousands of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, there are gospel activities throughout the earth and believers everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is difficult to find even one place where there is a group of God's children who are being built into the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must not blame others, saying that they do not want to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither should we say that there are no workers of God who are helping you to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot shirk our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every one of us is responsible for the building; every one of us needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I tell you, brothers and sisters, your most urgent need right now is to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>EDIFICATION DAMAGING THE CHURCH IF IT IS NOT FOR BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that by now we are clear that building and edification are vastly different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although building includes edification, edification is not necessarily building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may have been edified but not built up at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we see brothers and sisters who have been edified very much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet often the result is that the more they are edified, the more independent they become; the more they are edified, the more peculiar they become; the more they are edified, the more they despise others; and the more they are edified, the more they distance themselves from others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have seen a good number of people who are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more they receive this kind of edification, the more they become secluded and divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, if edification is not for building, it is of no benefit to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, often it even damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, as those who work for the Lord we have to be very careful!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we are ministering to the children of God, if our edifying of the believers only produces this kind of independent person, then our work is a complete failure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the brothers and sisters who are co-workers need to seriously ask themselves what the goal and purpose of their work is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have the vision of building, I am afraid that the more we work and the more we edify people, the more the church will lack the building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, when a builder wants to build a house, he has a definite goal, and he also has a blueprint in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He not only knows that he is building a house, but he also knows what kind of house he is building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only with this understanding can he work according to his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He knows that the house needs doors and windows, so he takes some materials, including wood and glass, and makes them into doors and windows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This may be considered his work of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he sets these doors and windows into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This setting is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, we can see that all the edification is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a builder is working, he has a goal, and he works toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose there is another builder who wants to build a house, yet he is making a table.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May I ask you, is his work useful for the building of the house?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may work much harder than the previous builder.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may be more meticulous and able to build the unseemly pieces of wood into a very nice table.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nonetheless, let me ask you all, can you build this table into or onto the house?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot put it on the foundation, neither can you place it on the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You cannot use it either as a door or as a window.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the table standing there seems to be more beautiful than everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seems to be saying, "Windows, none of you are as pretty as I am; doors, none of you are prettier than I. I am stronger than any one of you." Do you see this? The table built by the builder becomes a problem to the building of the whole house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Naturally you will say that no builder would do this, but today many of those who work for the Lord are certainly like this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are truly zealous for the work and genuinely zealous in edifying people, but they edify the brothers and sisters and make them into so many beautiful individual tables.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The other brothers and sisters may be like broken doors, broken windows, broken beams, and broken pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they are unseemly, they can still somewhat be put together and built into a house as a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the one who is a table, though very pretty, is all alone and is not built with others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, with respect to the building of the church, he is altogether useless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, he is often the cause of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Forgive me for saying that I am afraid that for some brothers and sisters all their progress and all the edification they have received is this kind of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am also afraid that many co-workers also edify people in this manner when they go forth to work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have reiterated that if we do not have the picture of building before us, and if we do not have the building of the church as our goal, then I am afraid that the work that we do will be this kind of foolish work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more we work, the less the church is built up.</S>
