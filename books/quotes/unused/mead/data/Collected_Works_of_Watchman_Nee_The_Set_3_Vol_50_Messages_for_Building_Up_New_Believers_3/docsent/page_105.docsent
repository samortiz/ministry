   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Leaving a Group Which Is Smaller</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Than the Body Not Breaking the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If anyone thinks that he should not be divisive, he should first bear in mind what it means to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being divisive means being divided from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The division in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to a division from the Body v. 25 , not a separation from a group which is not according to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christian oneness which God refers to is a oneness that is as large as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the oneness that we should keep and should not come out of.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If anyone who is concerned about keeping the oneness is in a group that is smaller and narrower than the Body of Christ, he should realize that this oneness is not Christian oneness or the oneness of the Spirit, even though the group may speak of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not Christian oneness because this kind of oneness is not as large as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he leaves any realm, group, or organization that is not as large as the Body, he is not offending Christian oneness; neither is he breaking it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot uphold any boundary or group that comes short of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must come out of that "oneness."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A child of God who keeps a oneness smaller than the Body of Christ is actually breaking Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. Concerning Division</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was striving in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some were saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul was absolutely against this contention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, "Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?" v. 13 . He told the Corinthians that they were factious and that this was a work of the flesh 3:3-4 . By speaking in this way, the Corinthians were being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who the Divisive Ones Are</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose one of these Corinthians was called Mark, another Stephen, and a third Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose all of them were for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose one day one of these brothers, whether Stephen or Philemon, stood up and said, "We have been meeting together and having good fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We feel that God's servant Paul is particularly used by God and that we should pay more attention to his teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have had good fellowship and have received much help from his speaking and his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of us are in the Lord and our fellowship is intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But recently I have felt that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today in Corinth there are hundreds of believers, but there are not that many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should go to them and fellowship with them in a proper way."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose the other brothers stood up and said, "You have sinned!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He prayed and asked the Father to make us one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus wants us to be one, but you are trying to leave us for another way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are not being one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are not glorifying the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not want to be one with us, the world will not believe in the Lord through our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have sinned, and you must depart from our midst because you are being divisive."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being Divisive Themselves, yet Condemning</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those Who Have Left as Being Divisive</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers, do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what many people say to our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They themselves are being divisive when they say, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have already created many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as soon as someone wants to leave, they say, "You should keep the Christian oneness."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But their oneness is not as large as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their oneness is only as large as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is divisive to keep a oneness that is smaller than the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even to say that I am of Paul is to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please bear in mind that they have already been separated from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do not see their own divisiveness, but if someone goes out from among them, they say that he is being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, this is the problem of many Christian groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many so-called people of God, many so-called Christian groups, have already separated themselves from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope I will not offend these ones by saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our spirit must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before God we must know that this is something sad, not joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we must be clear of our position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When some brothers or sisters want to return to the Body of Christ, these groups say that those who want to come out of them are being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not realize that all those who are in the divisive groups and who refuse to depart from them are being divisive themselves.</S>
