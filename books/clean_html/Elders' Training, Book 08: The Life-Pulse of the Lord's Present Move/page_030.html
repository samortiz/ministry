<h2 class="head1">SUPPORT FOR THE FULL-TIME ELDERS</h2>
<p>Another verse concerning full-time is 1 Timothy 5:17: &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; &ldquo;Double honor&rdquo; means they need double support. You have to support them, but it does not mean you have to pay them. There is no word even as a hint in the New Testament telling us that the church paid somebody to be their preacher or to be their elder. Yet Paul did tell us there were elders who went full-time and needed others to support them.</p>
<p>The last part of this verse says &ldquo;especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; To prepare the messages for all the meetings surely needs an elder&rsquo;s full time. If you still have a job, you will not be able to labor so well in your leisure time, after office hours, or on weekends. You need to be full-time to labor in the word. Paul says the ones who labor in the word and in teaching are worth even more than double honor. The ones who take the lead well are worthy of double honor, and the ones who are laboring in the word and teaching are worthy of more than double honor. Do not consider being full-time as a profession. Do not consider yourself as a preacher that the church has to pay. Just consider going this way by being led of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO BE FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>In principle, we have to realize that every saved one should be a full-timer. This is why Paul has the ground to charge us to present our bodies to God. Every saved one must be a full-timer, presenting his body to God. To present your body actually means to present yourself. Sometimes you may say that your body is here but your being is somewhere else. Actually, your being always goes with your body. Where your body goes, your being goes also. But you cannot say that where your being goes, your body also comes. Thus, to present your body is just to present yourself to God. As a saved one, you have to present yourself to God. Having presented yourself to God, you will be led by the Lord to either do a job to make money or to preach the gospel without making any money. Whether you do a job or preach the gospel depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
 <p>Today, however, due to our human concept, we call the full-timers the ones who have given up their jobs to preach the gospel, but we do not consider those who do a job as full-timers. Actually, all those who do a job should also be full-timers. Some brothers doing a job are really not full-timers. They are full-timers for themselves; they are not full-timers for God.</p>
<p>Sometimes when such a one who makes a lot of money is happy with God, with the church, and with the elders, he would decide to write a check. First, he has the thought to write a check for ten thousand dollars. Then he says to himself, &ldquo;Wait a minute. How could the church need ten thousand dollars? It&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s foolish. This is not the way to manage the finances, so I&rsquo;d better write a check for five thousand dollars.&rdquo; When his wife finds out that he is giving the church five thousand dollars, she says, &ldquo;The church doesn&rsquo;t need that much. One thousand is good enough.&rdquo; Then the check is written and they begin to eat their lunch. During lunch they have a further talk. The wife asks how much they have in the checking account. When the husband tells her that they have a lot in savings bonds, she will not agree with his selling the savings bonds. When the husband tells her there is only twelve hundred dollars in the checking account, she says, &ldquo;Could you write a check for one thousand out of twelve hundred? Don&rsquo;t you know that Mark, our second boy, needs five hundred dollars to pay for his tuition tomorrow?&rdquo; Then the husband replies, &ldquo;If that is the case, we&rsquo;d better write a check for five hundred and cancel the other one.&rdquo; Finally, they both agree to give the church five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Such a money maker surely is not a full-timer for God. Through church history and even among us we have seen some, although not too many, real full-timers who made money for God. They make ten thousand, yet they only spend two thousand for their living and give the rest to the Lord. Thus, they also are full-timers.</p>
<p>Every saint should be a full-timer. Every sister who is a housewife should also be a full-timer. We have a reputation with most Christians that we are people who love the Lord. Many married sisters pretend and even declare that they love the Lord. Eventually it becomes manifest that what they really love is their children. They do not even love their husbands so much as their children. Such a sister who declares that she loves the Lord yet who really loves her children more is not a full-timer. If a sister is really a full-timer, whether her children live or are taken away by the Lord, it is the same. Hence, to be a full-timer is not an easy thing. You need to say, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me. Whether I have my husband and my children or I lose everyone, I can bear it in Him who empowers me. I am a full-timer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO SLOPPY OR IDLE ONES<br />
TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>As the one who proposed to have five hundred full-timers per year in Taiwan, I am quite concerned that by this practice a lot will come in who are sloppy ones, idle ones, ones who just know how to eat, but do not know how to work. I have seen some like this already. When you encourage all the saints to go full-time, these ones will take the lead to say, &ldquo;I will be a full-timer; wonderful! I don&rsquo;t need to work. I don&rsquo;t need to go to the office during certain hours. I can sleep as long as I want. No one bothers me and no one fires me, since no one hires me. Once I declare that I am full-time and the church consents, then that is for my whole life.&rdquo; Do not assure these ones that the church will take care of them, otherwise you will spoil them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FULL-TIMER BEING ONE WHO IS<br />
ABSOLUTE FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>To be a full-timer means to be one who is absolute for the Lord. Your income may be five times what you need, yet you would only spend that one-fifth for your living and give the other four-fifths to the Lord. To talk about tithing as the Seventh-Day Adventists practice is a shame. That is something from the Old Testament, something in the law. In the New Testament it is not to present one tenth but to present your body, to present your entire being. This includes everything you are, everything you have, everything you can do, and everything you earn. It is not just one tenth but ten tenths.</p>
<p>We must teach this and promote this to the uttermost. Paul was such a person, and Aquila and Priscilla were such persons. They were for nothing else. They were just for the Lord. Even whatever they had for their living, that was also for the Lord. If they did not take care of their living, they would die. If they died, they could not live for the Lord. Whatever they did, even making a living to keep themselves alive, was also for the Lord. They did nothing for themselves.</p>
<p>We must uplift the standard of the biblical truth concerning the matter of being full-time. I hope that we all would be recovered in the understanding of such a truth. Do not think that this is a small matter. The Bible reveals some truths by plain words and other truths just by cases. None of the verses in the Scripture reading use the word full-time, but all of the cases are there. In all these cases is the truth of all the saved ones needing to be absolute for God, to be full-timers, regardless of what they do.</p>
