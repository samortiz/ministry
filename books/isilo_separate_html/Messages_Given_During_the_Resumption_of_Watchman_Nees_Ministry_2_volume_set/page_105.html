In the New Testament, the first thing that the Lord wants is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens. As far as the subject itself is concerned, it is the kingdom. As far as its having to do with God is concerned, it is the kingdom of God, and as far as its having to do with the heavens is concerned, it is the kingdom of the heavens. Many people do not pay attention to this matter. They do not have the thought of the kingdom in their mind. When they study the Bible, they only find such things as love, patience, and humility. Others, when they read the four Gospels, find such things as the miracles, the healings, the casting out of the demons, or the virtues of Christ. Man is curious by nature, and he likes to study these things. But there is one great subject in the Bible, and that is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens. This is the central thought of the four Gospels. After reading the four Gospels, if you are asked about their main subject, it would be natural for you to say that they contain records of miracles and works of wonder by the Lord. However, you have to realize that the main theme of the four Gospels, and especially that of the Gospel of Matthew, is the kingdom. The emphasis of the Gospels is neither the miracles nor the works of wonder, but the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>The first message of John the Baptist was, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 3:2). The first word that Christ uttered when He came out to preach was also, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 4:17). Afterwards, when the disciples went out to preach, they preached first the gospel of God's kingdom (Acts 8:12). In order for a man to know the things of God, he must first enter God's kingdom. The story between God and man is a story about His kingdom. In the Gospel of John, we see the matter of the kingdom mentioned (John 3:3, 5). In the Gospel of Luke, what the rich man encountered was also the matter of the kingdom (Luke 18:24-25). Even the life mentioned in the Gospel of John is for the kingdom. I repeat the matter of the kingdom over and over again and come back always to the same subject because I want you to see that the main theme in the Bible is the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM BEING THE STARTING POINT<br>AND THE MAIN POINT OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>What is the first thing that we present to others? In the New Testament, the first thing that the Gospels present is the kingdom. The principle of the New Testament is that whatever is mentioned first is the most important thing. The first mentioning of the gospel in the New Testament is the gospel of the kingdom. The first book in the New Testament, the book of Matthew, is a book that deals specifically with the kingdom. The first book of the New Testament is not the book of Romans. The New Testament does not deal firstly with sin or with the question of salvation. Nor is the first book the Gospel of John, which gives life. The first thing that God places before man is not salvation or baptism, but the kingdom. The first word that John the Baptist preached was not concerning sin, but concerning the kingdom. The first word that the Lord Jesus spoke to Nicodemus was also concerning the kingdom. To preach the gospel means to preach the kingdom. Regeneration is not for the purpose of dealing with the question of sin. It is to deal with the fact that the kingdom is ahead, and that we need to be regenerated to enter into this kingdom. A person repents, not because he is evil, nor because he has too many sins, but because there is a demand ahead of him that he has to enter into the kingdom. It is because there is a kingdom that a person needs life. Only when a person has life can he have the eyes to see the kingdom.</P><P>Today, when people preach the gospel, the first thing they present to others is heaven. Actually, in the New Testament where can you find heaven being presented first? Did the disciples or any other person present heaven? We are not saying that we do not need to mention sin or salvation when we preach the gospel. We are saying that the New Testament shows that the beginning of the gospel is the kingdom.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_104.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_106.html">Next</a> </body></html>
