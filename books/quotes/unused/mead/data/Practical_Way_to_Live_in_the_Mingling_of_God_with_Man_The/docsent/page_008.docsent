   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4-6, 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a mystery revealed in the Scriptures that we can never comprehend fully.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This mystery, which is revealed to us throughout the entire Bible, is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among Christians today the term mingling, particularly as it relates to the mingling of God with man, is rarely used.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This term was adopted by us from Leviticus 2:4, which says, And when you present an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened cakes mingled with oil or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Scriptures oil signifies the Holy Spirit of God, and fine flour signifies the human nature particularly that of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, in Leviticus 2:4 we see the mingling of the Holy Spirit with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The relationship between God and man in its highest aspect is one of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Indeed, God s intention and desire is to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this thought may be rather difficult for us to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to our natural thought, God is God and man is man He is our Creator and we are His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have always believed that we as God s creatures could only worship, serve, and fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unless we have received revelation, we have perhaps never had the thought that God mingles Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While it is true that the Scriptures speak concerning the worship of God, many people are preoccupied with this matter according to their natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we read the Scriptures carefully without any human concepts or ideas about the nature of our fellowship with God, we will realize that God s intention has much more to do with our being mingled with Him than it does with our outwardly worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>EATING AND MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the previous chapter, we pointed out that after God created man, He came to man not as the high and glorious God to be worshipped but as the tree of life to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the natural mind the thought that God s intention is to be partaken of by us as food does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before I saw this picture as a revelation, my thought had always been that God is so glorious, high, great, and holy, and we as men must worship, serve, and, at the very most, love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s intention, however, is not mainly that He would be worshipped by man; His intention is that man would take Him as food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire Bible speaks of this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Scriptures both the first and last pictures that reveal the relationship between God and man show us that God is to be partaken of by us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first picture in the Scriptures that shows us the relationship between God and man is that of God making Himself available as the tree of life to be partaken of by man Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last picture in the Scriptures is the same the tree of life growing on both sides of the river of water of life, which flows from the throne Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These pictures show us that God s intention is that He would be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as our food is mingled with us through our eating and digesting it, in order for God to fulfill His intention of being mingled with us, He must be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not my word; it is the word of the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He tells us in John 6 that He is the bread of life which came down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>48, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 57 the Lord tells us, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. In this verse, the Lord Jesus tells us emphatically that we can eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it is true that the Lord s word here bears some symbolic meaning, the word eat is very strong and definite in its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the Lord is bread, we have to eat Him and take Him as food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only so, in chapters 4 and 7, the Lord tells us that if we are thirsty, we can come to Him and drink Him as the living water 4:14; 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to John 1:12-13, to believe into the Lord simply means to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Throughout the Gospel of John, the Lord constantly tells men to believe into, that is, to receive, Him 8:24; 9:35; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>10:25-26; 14:1; 17:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We receive the Lord in the same way that we receive food and water by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is in the form of food so that He can be eaten and digested by man to become man s element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am burdened to share these things with you because the truth and mystery of the entire Word of God is centered on the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not see the mingling of God with man, it will be difficult for you to understand the mystery of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is love 1 John 4:16 , yet how can we enjoy God s love and express it to others?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way is to be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without being mingled with God, we can never enjoy God s love in a subjective way, and we can never share God s love with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is also light 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way that we enjoy God and allow God s light to shine through us is by being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mingling is the key to unlocking the mystery of the relationship between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is in Christ, Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us to do the work of mingling God with us Col 2:9; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more the Holy Spirit works within us, the more we are mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The expression one spirit indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , who is now in us 1 Cor 6:19 and is one with our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the realization of the Lord who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 and who is now with our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul s Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the mingling of two persons God and us into one.</S>
