   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THROUGH PRAYER MAN'S SPIRIT BEING CONSTANTLY EXERCISED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everyone who exercises his spirit prays.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only prayer makes a person exercised in his spirit, in the same way that only moving the feet enables a person to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to walk, we must move our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Similarly, if we would exercise our spirit, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer is not merely asking God for strength to accomplish what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, prayer causes us to exercise our spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are a man of prayer, your word will come out of your spirit when you go out to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your attitude will be grave, and your tone will be weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, before going out to preach the gospel, you must first have an extended time of prayer to build up your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Timothy 1, Paul said to Timothy, "Fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands" v. 6 . Fanning into flame the gift of God has much to do with our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This gift refers to the Spirit which we received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gift we received from the Lord is like a little fire dimly burning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to fan it into flame and add fuel to it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said that "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind" v. 7 . Power refers to our will, love refers to our emotion, and a sober mind refers to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our spirit is not frail; but we must exercise it more regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we live in our spirit, our morality will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The spirit makes a man sober and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The orderliness and sobriety from the spirit come neither from rational restrictions nor from pretense; they are lived out through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, they are spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything done and spoken from the spirit will surely convey God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PRAYER AND SINGING BUILDING UP MAN'S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you live in the spirit, you live in God, for God dwells in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is powerful and gracious; He is also holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As you live out God, love, holiness, righteousness, and power come out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way you become a powerful person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This power is a matter in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that before you go to the villages for the outreach, you will desperately exercise your spirit and will not be a light person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not enough for you to be a rational person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must exercise yourself to get into your spirit in order to build it up and strengthen it, just as an athlete exercises his body daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He does it in order to strengthen all the muscles of his body so that eventually his will can direct his body for an outstanding performance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An athlete exercises to strengthen the physical element of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Similarly, our exercise of the spirit builds up and strengthens our inner, spiritual element which is the Spirit bearing God's presence within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we should exercise our spirit all day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should never behave loosely in our living nor should we ever speak loosely, but in everything we should follow the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul said in Romans 8:4, "Walk according to spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul referred to our general conduct in living which should be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are a person following the spirit, the Scriptures you use for your gospel preaching and the songs you select will all be full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best way to exercise the spirit is first to pray and second to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hymn singing is very effective in freeing people from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It causes them to forget the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before you go to preach the gospel, it is best to sing one or two gospel hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you sing or pray, your spirit will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This training provides you with some preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the upcoming move, you will have to live in the spirit to be a person with a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By living in the spirit, you will be restricted, regulated, and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are not loose, spontaneously you will not easily have friction and conflict with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way there will be no difficulties produced in your relationships with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you cannot regulate or restrict yourselves, you will create friction with others in small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The best way to avoid creating difficulties is to live in the spirit and to yield to the restriction of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way the spirit will build up your person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In fact, a proper character that can be used by the Lord, as we have mentioned in the past, is brought forth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your going out to work for the Lord is like an army going into battle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every one of you has to be trained to send out the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, you desperately need to exercise your spirit all the time and build up your personality and character in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 27, 1988.</S>
