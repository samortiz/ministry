   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Knowing Grace for the Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of God's Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 15:1 says, "After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God came in to speak these words, Abraham was still in an elementary stage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After his slaughter of the kings, a strong enmity had been created between him and the people who belonged to those kings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Abraham was fighting the battle against the enemy, he was bold and brave.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But after gaining the victory and going home he might have said to himself, "What have I done?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those people might come back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What should I do then?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I only have three hundred and eighteen men, and they have many more than that."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Abraham began to be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times we are the same as Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are in faith, we are bold, saying, "Hallelujah to the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have lifted up my hand to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After gaining the victory and shouting hallelujahs in the meetings, you go home and begin to consider, saying to yourself, "What have I done?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What shall I do if the enemy returns?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God appeared to Abraham in 15:1, He said, "Fear not."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's saying this to Abraham indicates that Abraham was fearing his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God seemed to be telling him, "Abraham, you don't need to fear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am your shield.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am also your exceeding great reward."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham, still being in an elementary stage at the time, was concerned about two things: that his enemies might return to fight against him and that he still had no child of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham might have said, "Look at me I am old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Look at my wife she is nearly out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We still don't have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, don't You know we are getting old in years?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When will You give us a child?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God appeared to him, Abraham was concerned about these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the presence of God we cannot hide our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are given the opportunity, we shall sooner or later utter whatever is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in 15:2 Abraham said, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The next word that Abraham spoke to the Lord was not very polite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said, "Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, a son of my house is mine heir" 15:3, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham seemed to be saying, "Lord, I go childless because You have never given me a child.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must bear the blame for this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why do I go childless?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because You have never given me a child!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now You come to tell me that You are my great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What's the use of Your giving me a reward if I have no child?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham told the Lord that a son of his house, who was Eliezer of Damascus, would be his heir.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Darby's New Translation the footnote says that "a son of my house" means "one of his domestics."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that Eliezer must have come from Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It might have been that when Abraham was passing through Damascus he obtained him there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>None of us has ever answered God's call in a clean-cut way; we all dragged our feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham even suffered two deaths, the death of his elder brother, Haran, and his father, Terah.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, Abraham answered God's calling, being unable to avoid it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He left Haran, where he had been called the second time, taking Lot along with him, and passed through Damascus where he picked up Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord appeared to Abraham, saying that He was Abraham's shield and great reward, Abraham seemed to say in reply, "Lord God, I go childless because You have not given me a child.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The one whom I intend to have as the heir and possessor of my house must be my domestic servant, Eliezer."</S>
