   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verses 2-17 several miracles are specifically put together.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 18-27 are a record showing the effect of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The winds and the sea were rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that they must have had some consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the winds and the sea by themselves have no consciousness; the Lord was rebuking the demons behind the winds and the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The winds and the sea always come before a spiritual battle begins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 28: This verse is a fulfillment of what the Lord said in verse 18 concerning departing to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This portion mentions that there were two possessed by demons, but Luke's record mentions only one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of Luke's records are more detailed than Matthew's, especially concerning the sick ones, because Luke himself was a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, Matthew 8:2 mentions "a leper," but Luke, in 5:12, says "a man full of leprosy."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning this particular case of being possessed by demons, Luke's record says that a certain man was possessed by a legion of demons Luke 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Luke was a medical doctor, he had his own observation concerning the sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Luke recorded only one possessed by demons for the following reasons: 1 Since the two were the same, it was enough to record only one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 Luke did not directly follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What he wrote was based on what he had investigated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, he recorded only the events he had examined.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 Matthew portrayed the Lord as King.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, he often recorded two, that is, in plurality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, Luke showed the Lord as man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For a man, it is sufficient to give the account of one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4 The Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Jewish regulations, for a testimony there must be two people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, the Gospel of Luke is written to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since there is no such regulation among the Gentiles, there is no need to record two.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>5 The emphasis of Matthew is on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he did not record the rest of the things related to the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, the emphasis of Luke is on morality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, he gave a detailed account of the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Coming out of the tombs."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are demon possessed are neighbors to the dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 29: "They cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Have you come here before the time to torment us?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the demons are wicked, they still confess that the Lord is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in this respect they are better than some human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Before the time."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the original text the definite article "the" indicates a specific time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The demons know the time of their torment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This gives us a hint that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 30: "Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many hogs feeding."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord did not respond to the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The less we speak to the demons the better.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 32: "And He said to them, Go!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And they came out and went into the hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord spoke only one word, "Go!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The hogs rushed into the sea on their own because they would not tolerate being possessed by the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this respect, they are better than human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 33: "And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Spurgeon said that when false believers die, the pastor would flee into the city to report to people the terrifying news.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 34: "The whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The people entreated the Lord to depart from their borders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the same as the request of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord never forces people, so He departed from them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Chapters eight through twelve, constituting the third major section, describe how the King manifested Himself and how He was rejected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 8:2-17 we see the Lord as the Son in four different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 8:18 9:8, which is the second minor section, the Lord's authority is manifested in four aspects: the aspect of nature, the aspect of demons, the aspect of men, and the aspect of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These four things reveal man's heart to man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These four sections reveal mainly two things: 1 the Lord's power and 2 the intent of man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verses 35-38 of chapter nine should be placed at the beginning of chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Matthew 9:9-34, the third minor section, speaks of how Christ shows mercy to man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The second minor section shows us the authority of Christ.</S>
