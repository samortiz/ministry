<h2 class=head2>To Overflow from within the Believers</h2><p>John 7:38-39 reveals that the Spirit will overflow from within the believers: “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.” In John 4:14 the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life. In chapter seven the Lord goes further and says that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life. In verse 38 the Lord Jesus does not speak of one flow; He speaks of rivers. The unique river of living water is the Holy Spirit. Out of this unique river many rivers will flow out. These rivers of living water are the many flowings of the different aspects of life, of the one river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God’s Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). This is the Spirit overflowing from within the believers.<h2 class=head2>The Seven Spirits before the Throne of God as the Seven Eyes of the Lamb, the Son</h2><p>In the book of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God as the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). The fact that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son, proves that the Son and the Spirit are not separate.<p>According to the traditional concept, the Spirit is separate from the Son. But according to the book of Revelation, the Spirit is the eyes of the Son. Are, then, the Spirit and the Son one or two? The book of Revelation indicates clearly that the seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ, the Son. This means that the so-called Third of the Trinity is the eyes of the Second. Then how could the eyes of the Second be regarded as a separate person from the Second? Can a person’s eyes be regarded as a separate person apart from him? This is impossible! In resurrection Christ has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, the two, Christ and the Spirit are one (2 Cor. 3:17). We may say that Christ and the Spirit are distinct, but we may not say that They are separate. Concerning this matter, we simply teach what the Bible says. The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the wonderful Lamb!<h2 class=head2>One with the Bride, God’s Redeemed</h2><p>The Spirit is one with the bride, God’s redeemed. Revelation 22:17a indicates this: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!” The fact that the Spirit and the bride speak together reveals that the Spirit is one with the bride. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the bride is the consummation of God’s redeemed people. In Revelation the consummation of the Triune God marries the consummation of God’s redeemed people to form a universal couple. In Revelation 22:17 we see a divine-human marriage. The Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, is the Husband, and the consummation of God’s redeemed people is the bride. Because the Spirit and the bride are one, they speak as one. How marvelous!<h2 class=head2>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being the One God, and the Entire God Being the Spirit</h2><p>Regarding the divine Trinity, we would also point out that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the one God. First Peter 1:2 reveals that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8, that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4, that the Spirit is God. Moreover, according to John 4:24, the entire God is the Spirit. To say that God is Spirit means that Spirit is the nature, the substance, of the Triune God. For example, just as the substance of a wooden table is wood, the substance of God is Spirit. Hallelujah, our God, the Triune God, is Spirit!
