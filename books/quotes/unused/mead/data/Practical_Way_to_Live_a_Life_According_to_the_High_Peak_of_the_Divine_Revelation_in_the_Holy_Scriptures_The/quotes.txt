[2]  How good it is that You have gathered us together to meet You not only with the Word but as the Word, to meet You as the Spirit, to meet You as all the saints, and to meet You as the church, the Body of Christ.
[3]  The second great accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God was His passing through human living for thirty-three and a half years.
[4]  In His all-inclusive death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death and who is related to the flesh of sin Heb 2:14; John 12:31b .
[5]  Christ first became a man, and that man was born to be God's firstborn Son.
[6]  The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Christ the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ Rom 8:9 .
[7]  Christ is our High Priest in God's New Testament economy to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs Heb 4:14; 7:26; 9:11 .
[8]  OF HIS RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10 OUTLINE The life of Christ, the first God-man, on the earth: Being both God and man, having the divine life and the human life.
[9]  The believers in Christ as His brothers the many God-men needing to live: A life as a copy of the life of Christ the first God-man 1 Pet 2:21a.
[10]  Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."
[11]  God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man, living on earth as a God-man.
[12]  Yet when He lived on earth as the God-man, He did not live by His human life, but by His divine life.
[13]  C. Dying to Himself but Living to the Father
[14]  B. Bearing the Cross in the Steps of Christ
[15]  Such a life of dying to ourselves and living to God is for Christ, the first God-man, to be formed in His many brothers, the many God-men, for the building up of His organic Body that the eternal economy of God might be carried out.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE THE UNVEILED TRUTH OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION FOR THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45b
[17]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we have been caught by Your mercy and grace to be Your seekers pursuing You according to what the Scripture reveals to us.
[18]  Since I came to the United States in 1962, I have put out many messages teaching one thing.
[19]  We have gone higher and higher to reach the peak of the divine revelation, to see that the ultimate goal of God's economy is that He became a man that many of His chosen people might become God in the divine life and the divine nature, but not in the Godhead.
[20]  OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19b-21a OUTLINE To live Christ Phil 1:21a: Not by our natural human life, but by the divine life of Christ in resurrection Col 3:4 , including: To pursue and gain Christ Phil 3:8, 12-14.
[21]  To enjoy Christ as the God-allotted portion and participate in His riches in the fellowship of God Col 1:12; 1 Cor 1:9.
[22]  By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b: The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of God as He was before the resurrection of Christ, but the Spirit of God after passing, along with Christ, through His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, becoming the processed and consummated Spirit: Of Jesus in His incarnation, human living, and death Acts.
[23]  It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.
[24]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are both the Word and the Spirit.
[25]  We need to live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b-21a .
[26]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ was not in the Old Testament, nor was He there before the resurrection of Christ.
[27]  Living Christ also includes tasting Christ for growing in Him 1 Pet 2:2-3 and enjoying Christ as the God-allotted portion and participating in His riches in the fellowship of God Col 1:12; 1 Cor 1:9 .
[28]  To live Christ by the divine life of Christ in resurrection is to have Christ grow in us that we may be formed inwardly and even conformed to the image of Christ as the Firstborn of God among many brothers Gal 4:19; Rom 8:29b .
[29]  THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BROTHERS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:29 OUTLINE The image of God's Son: The image of the Lord Jesus Christ Rom 1:3-4: The Lord Jesus Christ being God and man.
[30]  The predestination of God: The believers in Christ, who have been called and justified by God, being predestinated to be conformed to the image of the first God-man, Jesus Christ Rom 8:29-30.
[31]  Thus, Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 becoming the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29-30: Christ, as the Son of God, putting humanity upon Himself in His incarnation.
[32]  All the God-men, the believers in Christ, needing to be conformed to the image of such a firstborn Son of God, living a life crucified in the human life to live by the divine life that they may be the real God-men to be the expression of God in humanity with the divine attributes lived out from humanity, to be the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem, as revealed in details from the following chapters of Romans to the end of Revelation, for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God.
[33]  Now we must see that we need to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .
[34]  CHAPTER SIX TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST
[35]  THE HEAD, IN ALL THINGS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16 OUTLINE The Body of Christ is: The center, reality, and goal of the eternal economy of God, consummating in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:1 22:5.
[36]  The new man Col 3:10-11; Eph 2:15; 4:24: The corporate God-man: The first God-man, the firstborn Son of God, being the Head of this corporate God-man the new man.
[37]  Prayer: Lord, we praise You that You are the beginning and the ending.
[38]  The Body of Christ is first the church, the congregation, the gathering, the assembly, of the called-out ones.
[39]  The Body of Christ is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God constituted with the believers in Christ, the many God-men, as the outward human framework; the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, as the divine essence; the all-inclusive Christ, the unlimited Christ, as the divine element; and God the Father, who is over all and through all and in all, as the divine source Eph 4:4-6 .
[40]  The Body of Christ is also the new man Col 3:10-11; Eph 2:15; 4:24 .
[41]  The many God-men, the many sons of God, are the Body of this corporate God-man the new man.
[42]  Paul said in Ephesians 2:10 that we are the masterpiece of God.
[43]  The Body of Christ as the new creation, as the organism of God, is the poem of God.
[44]  This masterpiece of God was created in Christ through His death and resurrection with His divine element in its all-inclusiveness.
