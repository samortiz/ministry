With the appearance of the kingdom, there are three items: the changed nature, the tares; the changed outward appearance, the fa&#231;ade, the big tree; and the inward rottenness and corruption, the leaven.</p><p>Following the parable of the tares, the third parable is that of the mustard seed (13:31-32). Here, the enemy in his subtlety caused the mustard seed to grow into a huge tree-a lodging place for birds-that is no longer good for food. This is against the law of God&#8217;s creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind (Gen. 1:11-12).</p><p>The fourth parable concerns leaven. In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12). The Roman Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. Our natural being likes to use certain methods to make spiritual things easier to assimilate. In the eyes of God, any gimmick-anything other than Christ, the Word, prayer, and the Spirit-is leaven.</p><p>In the fifth parable we have the treasure hidden in the field (v. 44). Christ redeemed the God-created earth because within the earth, the field, there was the kingdom, the treasure. The next parable reveals Christ as the merchant (v. 45) seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it He sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan, it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of Gentile believers. In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom. In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building. The overcomers can be regarded as the fulfillment of the treasure and the pearl. Through their remaining under the secretion of Christ&#8217;s life, constantly being constricted, reduced and transformed, they are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat.</p><p>The first six parables in Matthew 13 are related to the church. The seventh parable, the parable of the net, is related to the world, to the Gentiles. The net here signifies the eternal gospel which will be preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation (Rev. 14:6-7). The nations are likened to fish in the sea. These &#8220;fish&#8221; are brought to the presence of the Lord, and the Lord exercises His judgment upon them according to the way they have treated the believers during the great tribulation.</p><p>In verse 52 the Lord spoke another parable. A learned one, a scribe, who has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old. The apostle Paul was such a person. Today in His recovery, the Lord not only needs the fishermen, but some scribes full of knowledge for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
