   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Its Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Paul's writings the way of the believers' growth in life is revealed in much more detail than in Peter's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Paul's writings, the believers grow in life by drinking the spiritual milk 1 Cor 3:2a; Heb 5:12b , by eating the spiritual food Heb 5:14a , by drinking the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13b , by being watered 1 Cor 3:6b, 7b , and by God operating in them Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers also grow in life by Christ living in them and making His home in them Gal 2:20a; Eph 3:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is not only living in us but also making His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He desires to get Himself settled within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers grow in life also by the Spirit of Jesus Christ supplying bountifully in them Phil 1:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the Spirit of Jesus Christ there is a rich and bountiful supply in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The believers grow in life also by the growth of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we grow in the divine life, God also grows in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since God is complete and perfect in Himself, we may wonder why God needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is true that God is complete and perfect in Himself, but He is not complete and perfect in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In most of us God is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How much God do you have within you?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God knows the answer to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, we all need to allow God to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally, in Paul's writings the believers grow in life by the supply out from the Head, Christ Eph 4:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While we as members are growing, Christ the Head is supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out from the Head we receive the supply for us to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our spiritual life, day by day we need to eat sufficiently, rightly, and properly to receive the supply from Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to practice eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to learn how to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be healthy we need five things: eating, drinking, breathing, resting, and exercising.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do these five things in our Christian life, we will be spiritually healthy and will surely grow in life.</S>
