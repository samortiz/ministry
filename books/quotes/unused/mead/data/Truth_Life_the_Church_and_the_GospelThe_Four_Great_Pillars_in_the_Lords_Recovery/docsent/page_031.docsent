   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Being the Gathering of the Believers and Leaving the Church Being Improper</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, the Lord has to build the believers into the church, and on the other hand, the believers cannot leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 18 the Lord said that if a brother refuses to hear the church, let him be just like a Gentile v. 17 . This does not mean that we should excommunicate him but that because this brother does not behave properly, we cannot regard him as a brother; instead, we should regard him as a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, for a believer to leave the church is a kind of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, in the church we should seriously receive the dealings arranged for us by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Producing and the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord mentions the church in the Gospel of Matthew, but the church had not yet been produced at that time 16:18; 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, as recorded in Acts, one day three thousand people were saved and then about five thousand on another day 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter eight, instead of being called the believers in Jerusalem, they were called the church in Jerusalem v. 1 . In Acts 9:31; 12:1; 13:1; and 14:23, the believers in different places were called the church in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter fourteen records that Paul went out to preach the gospel, passed through many places, and led many people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps in less than a year Paul went back to these places and appointed elders for them in every church v. 23 . Those believers had been saved for no longer than a year, but the Bible still calls them the church, and there were some who became elders in the same year that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our concept we tend to think that a group of newly saved people cannot be considered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They can only meet together, and there is no way to appoint elders from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How could a Christian who has been saved less than a year be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Paul did not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Right after he had preached the gospel and led some people to be saved, he came back to those places, called them churches, and appointed elders in place after place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, those churches were young churches and those elders were baby elders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we are all spiritual children when we are saved, once we start meeting and living in the church life, we spontaneously grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is a place that causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps someone will say that since he has been saved for thirty-eight years, whenever he comes to the meetings, he finds that everyone there is either a spiritual child or a young person, so he simply stays at home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, he has never considered that if he stays at home, he will become a thirty-eight-year-old child, an elderly infant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to grow, we must remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a person stops meeting with the church for two or three weeks, immediately he stops growing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he does not meet for two years, he will become like a child again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he stops attending the meetings for another three years, he will be nearly finished in his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Able to Grow in Life Only in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though the condition of the church may not be good, when people come to meet, they spontaneously grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never think that in the church meetings the message is not good enough, the sharing is not up to the standard, the singing is a mess, and that you would rather stay at home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do so, you will lose many blessings, and your spiritual life will wither.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The principle of God s blessing is that His blessing is in the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, attending the worst church meeting is better than staying at home, because whoever becomes individualistic loses the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to be blessed, enjoy grace, and grow in life, we have to attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though we may just be following others to pray and sing in the meetings, we will still grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, suppose there is a church that truly resembles the church in Laodicea; it is neither hot nor cold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When people come to the meetings, they become sluggish, wanting to rest and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even the elders doze there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, even if this is the case, as long as we do not leave the church we will still grow in life, because God s blessing is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people may argue, saying, I can read the Bible anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can come near to the Lord at home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is true, but if you leave the church and pursue the Lord at home, your pursuit surely will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may be able to rise up at six on the first day, but on the second day you will change your rising time to 6:15.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the third day you will change it to 6:45, on the fourth day you will postpone it until 7:15, and on the fifth day, you may not get up at eight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then on the sixth day you may not even want to come near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, it is impossible to pursue the growth in life apart from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The blessing is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the weakest church is stronger than the individual.</S>
