   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. ALL THE FRANKINCENSE WITH PART OF THE FINE FLOUR AND PART OF THE OIL BURNED ON THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the frankincense with part of the fine flour and part of the oil was burned on the altar 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This signifies that a considerable portion of Christ's excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as food for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's human living on earth was excellent, but it is difficult for us to say what this excellence refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may say that it refers to the high standard of His attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How high is this standard?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There has never before been such a standard among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is a God-man anointed, mingled, and filled with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, even before He was crucified, He expressed resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He expressed resurrection in everything, even in rebuking the Pharisees Matt 23:1-36 and in cleansing the temple John 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The excellency of Christ's human living on earth was in His manhood and in His Godhood; it was in His humanity and divinity in the Spirit and with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is how the four Gospels reveal Him in His excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ's humanity is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is fine, even, and fully balanced, lacking nothing and not having anything in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, He is filled with the Spirit and saturated with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He walked on earth, He was always filled with the Spirit and saturated with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. As a Memorial</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The frankincense with part of the fine flour and the oil was burned as a memorial because of its satisfying effect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A memorial is greater than satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may be satisfied with many things but not make those things a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we have the highest satisfaction, we will make that satisfaction a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God enjoys Christ to such an extent that this enjoyment becomes a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. As a Satisfying Fragrance</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A satisfying fragrance is a sweet savor; it is a fragrance that gives rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rich elements of the meal offering Christ's humanity, divinity, and His excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living are a fragrance that gives God rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE REMAINDER OF THE MEAL OFFERING BEING FOR AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The remainder of the meal offering is for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy portion of the offerings of Jehovah by fire" Lev 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This signifies that we also can enjoy Christ's human living as our food after God's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, God must be given His portion that He may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The remainder is our portion for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is easy to say that we can enjoy Christ's human living as our food, but how can we actually do this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Considering the type in Leviticus 2 will help in answering this question.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The type here is a picture signifying Christ's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fine flour signifies Christ's humanity, and the oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The oil and the flour are mingled to produce an oiled fine flour, a fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, to eat the fine flour is to eat the oil; it is also to eat the mingling, for the oil and the flour cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The picture in Leviticus 2 indicates strongly that the way for us to enjoy Christ's human living is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 6 proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus reveals that He is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" v. 51 . Unable to understand this, the Jews "contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" v. 52 . In verse 63 the Lord Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life." This indicates that the way to eat Jesus is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would eat Jesus by the Spirit, we need to realize that the Spirit today is consolidated in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we touch the word, we touch what is consolidated, or embodied, in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To eat Jesus, to take Jesus, to enjoy Jesus, we must touch His word, and when we touch His word, the Spirit is there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the New Testament, the divine Spirit is related to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to touch the word of the Lord by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way to touch the Lord's word by our spirit is to pray-read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we come to the word, we should not merely exercise our eyes and our mind, reading the word as if it were a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to pray and exercise our spirit as well as our eyes and our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do this, we are apparently touching the word; actually we are touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit is mingled with the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, by exercising our spirit to touch the Spirit consolidated in the word, we eat the human life and living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can we enjoy Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can enjoy Christ by exercising our spirit to pray-read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we pray-read the Lord's word, we touch His Spirit, and this Spirit is mingled with His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we are nourished with the highest humanity the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In ourselves we cannot live a human life like that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only He can live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we can take Jesus at any time by coming to His word and exercising our spirit to pray-read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we do this, we touch the Spirit, and the Spirit supplies us with Jesus as our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we are what we eat, the more we eat Jesus, the more we are constituted with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By our eating of Jesus' human living, His living becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Spontaneously, without any self-effort, we will be as humble and holy as Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to enjoy Jesus as our food for us to live a life which is qualified to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Over a period of fifteen hundred years, God has prepared a book for us, the Bible, and has put it in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has also given His Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Spirit is within and the book is without.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These two things added together are just Christ in His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we exercise our spirit and pray-read the word, we touch the Spirit and enjoy Christ's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the meal offering.</S>
