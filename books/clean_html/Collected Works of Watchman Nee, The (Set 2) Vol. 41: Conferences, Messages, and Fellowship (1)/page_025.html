<h2 class="head1">GOD INTENDS FOR CHRIST<br />TO BE OUR LIFE AND SATISFACTION</h2><p>The new life and new power that God has given to us is simply Christ Himself. Today Christ lives within us. What is He doing within us? He is within us as our life, and He is within us to be with us all the time. The Lord said that He will not leave us as orphans (John 14:18). We can say that the wretched man in Romans 7 is an orphan, and we can call Romans 7 a chapter about orphans. The man in Romans 7 had new demands and new desires, yet he could not meet these needs. He was like an orphan hungry for food, but who was without food. The weather was cold and he needed clothing, yet he was without clothing. He had to find all these things by himself. Yet even when he willed to have these things, he could not have them. The Lord said that He would live within us and meet all our needs. Tonight I am not just preaching a Christ who has died for us. I am not just preaching a crucified Christ but a Christ who is living in us, a Christ who supplies all our needs.</p><p>We should not be satisfied with the Christ we knew in the past. In John 4 the Lord told the Samaritan woman, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (vv. 13-14). This is the life in the Spirit which Christ gives to us. This life is a spring. Christ does not give us something that can be contained in a bucket or exhausted in a few days. Christ supplies a spring within us. We can draw from it all the time "into eternal life." It will not run out even when we see God face to face. Christ is in us as our life, and He is supplying all of our needs.</p><p>Many Christians say that they are saved, but their lives do not appear any different from those who are not saved. I have often joked that some Christians are "not quite saved." Do not be mistaken. I am not saying that they are not saved. I am saying that they do not appear to be quite saved. This means that they have not reached the biblical definition of being saved. Can you say that you have Christ as your Shepherd and that you "shall not want"? Is Christ your Shepherd? Can you say that you have no want? You may have to confess that you have many wants. If you answer in this way, it proves that you need to know Christ in a deeper way. The Christ mentioned in the Bible is One who can satisfy your heart. He will make your heart thirsty again and again, yet He will satisfy your thirst again and again. I must say Hallelujah! The Lord has given us a spring. This is not like listening to a sermon once a week on Sunday and then running out of the supply for the other six days of the week. He is a spring within us which wells up into eternal life. A Christian has no need of a bucket because there is a well within him. The water within many Christians seems to come from a bucket; it quickly runs out. But the Bible says that there is a spring within a Christian, which wells up into eternal life. The source of supply in a tap is the reservoir; the supply is not from the house itself. In the same way, the source of life of a Christian is Christ; it is not from himself. What a difference this is from the man in Romans 7, who wills and fails again and again.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD INTENDS FOR CHRIST TO BECOME OUR VICTORY</h2><p>Many people think that they are too weak and that they have failed too often. They ask God to strengthen them. They think that as long as they have the power, they can overcome sin. Yet even if they had the power, they could not overcome sin. They are often amazed when they are overcome by their sin. But in themselves can they do anything other than sin? It should not be a surprise at all for them to sin. A Western missionary once said to me, "I sin often. I am sick of my sins. I cannot overcome no matter how hard I try. My work in China has failed." While I was listening, I was laughing. She asked, "Why are you laughing?" I said, "You feel strange that you sin. But I do not feel strange at all. To me this is most common. I may be surprised if you committed greater sins, but I am not surprised that you are committing these kinds of sins." She said, "I have been preaching in China for seven years. I know that God has called me, and I have experienced Him a little. Yet I always fail. How can I work any longer? God has to give me the strength to overcome my sins." I said, "If you prayed for anything else, God might answer you. But if you pray for God to give you the strength to overcome your sins, He will not answer. He will not give you the strength to overcome your sins."</p><p>I told her that her mistake was in trying to mend the old creation with the new creation. She was weak, and she asked for strength to overcome her sin. Yet the power of the new life, the power of God, is not given to us to sustain our old man or to empower it to overcome sins. God never does this. We need to ask God to grant us new light and new revelation. We need Him to show us that it is not a surprise for us to be weak. It is absolutely right that we should overcome sin. The problem is that the human life will always remain the human life. This life does not have the power to overcome sin. God has no intention for us to overcome sin with our human life, and He has no intention to sustain our old life with His power. God intends for Christ to be our life, our strength, and our victory.</p>
