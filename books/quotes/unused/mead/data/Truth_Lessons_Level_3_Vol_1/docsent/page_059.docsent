   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the children of Israel went out of Egypt boldly, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, made ready his horses and chariots and took his army with him to pursue them and, eventually, arrived at the place of their encampment.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we are guided by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, even if we are opposed, we are still in the light, but the opposers are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consequently, the opposers will perish, but we will be completely unharmed.</S>
