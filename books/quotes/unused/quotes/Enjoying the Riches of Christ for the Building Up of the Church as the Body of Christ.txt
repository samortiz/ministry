If they are not a part of the church, although we may consider them to be in God's will, in reality they are not
Strictly speaking, God is not interested in our marriage, education, job, health, family, husband, wife, children, or parents
We know that Christ died on the cross for our sins, yet few have heard that Christ died on the cross to create the one new man, the church
Christ not only crucified the old things and the negative things, but He also created something new-the one new man, the church
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
When the grain falls into the earth and dies underneath the earth, it grows up and is released to become many grains
It is not a small thing that Jesus died on the cross, because when Jesus died, God died in Him and man died in Him
By the incarnation of Jesus, God came into man, but by the death and resurrection of Christ, man has been brought into God
These verses reveal a fourfold power: resurrecting power, transcending power, subduing power, and overruling power
When we believed in Jesus, we were joyful and peaceful, but much more than this, a kind of power was transmitted into us
Some of the young ones may want to give up, at least in part, but this does not depend on them; God will never give up
According to Ephesians this power is to make us a living part of the church the Body of Christ the fullness of the One who fills all in all
On the other side, however, we must cooperate by removing any insulation which hinders the transmission of this power
We must condemn this insulation and repent of it by making a confession, applying the blood to cleanse and wash away the insulation
It is not only a matter of confessing our failures, repenting of our insulation, and applying the blood for all the negative things
Many people today have five or six meals a day, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner with a morning, afternoon, and evening snack
We need to experience the heavenly power, the heavenly electricity, but if we do not enjoy the riches, we will be empty and hungry
In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus also said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
If our spouse or roommate gives us a difficult time and causes us to become angry, we need power to overcome our temper
Just by calling on the name of the Lord we receive the power of Christ, which is like electricity transmitted to us
The more we are in His power and participate in His riches, the more we become the church, His Body, His fullness
The more we study the Bible, the more we realize that it is difficult to completely comprehend who and what Christ is
Many in Christianity think that they know Christ in a complete way, but in actuality, there is no possibility to completely know Christ
He is God, He is man, He is the Father, He is the Son, He is the Spirit, He is the Creator, and He is also the creature
We must forget all the theologies and teachings that we picked up from Christianity and come back to the pure Word
He is also in us, and He is one with us, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says: 'But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Today this economy is still a mystery to many people, but today we know this economy, this dispensation, of such a wonderful Christ
At this time Christ will be fully wrought into His Body, not in all of His believers, but at least in a group of overcomers
Christ as the Head will be wrought into this group of overcomers, and these overcomers will be the bride ready for His coming
All the gifts including the apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers are for bringing the Head into the Body
If by our receiving these messages the Head works Himself more into us, that is wonderful; otherwise, these messages are in vain
Because many of us have been frustrated and distracted by old teachings, it is better for us to forget all these teachings
If as young persons we have something to say to our parents, yet in our spirit we sense that it is negative, we must not say it
If we have the desire to go fishing or to go dancing, yet in our spirit we sense something negative, we should not go
God's dispensing includes creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and eventually the rapture
God's economy is to dispense Christ into us, and to dispense Christ into us simply means to work Christ into us
The economy of God is simply a matter of the dispensing of Christ into all of us, and the issue of God's dispensing of Christ is the church
Perhaps many have never heard the term the dispensing of Christ into us or that God's economy is to work Christ into us
Some have gone even further, saying that while we are on this earth we have to adjust ourselves, improve ourselves, and glorify the Father
God's economy is to have a corporate Body, a corporate man, which is the issue of the dispensing of all the riches of Christ
Romans 9 tells us that in God's creation we were made vessels unto honor, vessels of glory , to contain a treasure, Christ
If we were not short of Christ, we would not be wrong, but if we are short of Christ, even to be right means nothing
If a brother is short of Christ, whether he loses his temper with his wife or is good to her makes no difference
Whether we are good or we are bad, whether we are a success or we are a failure, makes no difference as long as we are short of Christ
To be right or wrong is according to the law, but today we are not in the dispensation of the law; we are in the dispensing of Christ
If we lose our temper with our wife, we may know how to repent, but we may not realize that we are short of Christ
The Gospel of John begins with 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
It goes on to say, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are here, and the Son is the Sender of the Spirit who comes from with the Father
Without the Spirit entering into us, the Lord being life would not be real to us; it would merely be a doctrine
When the Spirit comes into us, He guides us into the reality that Christ is the life, because the Spirit is the reality of life
In Darby's New Translation, 2 Corinthians 3:7 through 16 is parenthetical; verse 17 is a continuation of verse 6
Strictly speaking, today we are in the dispensing not of God the Father or even of the Son alone but of the Spirit
We must spend much time coming back to the Spirit because in the Lord's recovery nothing else is as important as this
They may pray-read the verses about which we are speaking, and they may attend the meetings, but they still may not be able to see
If, however, this person eats steak and chicken day by day, after a few months his face will be transformed from within
Transformation is a change in life, not merely a change in outward behavior according to the law or according to what is right
The more Christ as the 'tea' is added into us, the more we are 'Christified,' that is, we are sanctified and transformed
To be transformed is mainly to be renewed in our mind, and to be renewed in our mind is simply to be rid of all our opinions
He admitted that there was no difference in the eyes of God, but that there was a great difference in his eyes
In the beginning was the Word, this Word was God, and one day this Word became flesh, tabernacling among us, full of grace and reality
The Word, who was God becoming flesh and tabernacling among us, was full not of doctrines and teachings but of enjoyment and reality
God's intention in His economy is to dispense Christ into us, and for this dispensing there must be some means
Apparently, all the words in the Bible are letters printed on paper, but in actuality they are spirit and life
Sometimes we may not understand what we read, and sometimes we may understand but not be able to utter what we see
To touch the Bible in this way makes us like the Jews who researched the Bible without touching the Lord Jesus
Whenever we open the Bible, we have to open our mouth, and whenever we read a word in the Bible, we have to utter it from our spirit
These heavenly elements and spiritual ingredients will cause us to have not only an outward change but a metabolic change, a change in life
He does not have a supply for the church life because the riches of Christ have been dispensed into him only for a short time
The best digestion occurs when the food that gets into our stomach has a free course to get into our whole system
After pray-reading, we may have the intention to go fishing, but something within us indicates that we should not go
If we will say Amen Lord every time something within us forbids us restricts us adjusts us or corrects us we will be hungry for prayreading
When the children of Israel entered into the good land, they began to enjoy the rich produce from the good land
They were commanded by God to hold three feasts a year: the feast of the Passover , Pentecost , and the Feast of Tabernacles
God created man in His own image, and God gave man dominion over all things, especially over the earth and the creeping things
Many trees were in the garden, and all were good for food, but only one tree was designated with the name the tree of life
According to medical doctors mans physical body contains all the elements of the dust including salt copper iron sulfur and many other items
Man had the image of God, and he also had the dominion of God, but he still did not have the life of God, which is God Himself
God put man in front of the tree of life in the midst of the garden , indicating by this that man should partake of it
God put man in front of the tree of life so that he would take the tree of life, and He also warned man not to take of the tree of knowledge
God's intention was that Adam would take the tree of life and have nothing to do with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The only way for the chicken to be life to us is for us to slaughter it, cook it, serve it on the dining table, and eat it
The Lord Jesus Himself was wild because He said in John 6:57, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
God in Christ to be our life in the form of food is revealed, typified, and prefigured in many ways in the Old Testament
Many in Christianity pay their full attention to the sprinkling of the blood, but they neglect the eating of the lamb
Under the covering of the blood they could eat the meat of the lamb so that they would be prepared to walk out of Egypt
Manna is wonderful, but manna has an aspect which is not so good: God never asked His people to worship Him with manna
They had to bring all the offerings-the cattle, the firstborn ones, and the top produce of the good land-to God as their worship
The natural, human, and religious concepts are that Jesus is the Son of David, of the royal family, even the King
Corinthians 1:7 says, 'So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Chapter three says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
The Corinthians held the concept that they needed knowledge and gifts, but according to Paul they were still infants
The Corinthians wrongly took knowledge and the gifts, so Paul adjusted them by telling them that their need was Christ as their food
He seemed to be saying, 'You have the teaching of Balaam, you have the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and you are taught by the woman Jezebel
Today many dear hungry and seeking Christians are distracted and led away by all the teachings from the enjoyment and eating of Christ
Now the Lord is recovering us and bringing us back from all the teachings in today's degraded Christianity to the pure eating of Jesus
Today people pay attention to the charismatic things, the gifts, but many of those who emphasize the gifts are the most divisive
Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city'
Never forget that the church is a cultivated land, a harvest, and that all the members of the church need the growth in life
The proper way to contact the Lord is to call on His name: 'For the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him'
The Bible begins with the tree of life, it continues with the tree of life, and it closes with the tree of life
If we pay our attention to the Bible, we will see that the two ends of the Bible correspond one with the other; they reflect each other
At the beginning of the Bible are the tree of life and a river , and at the end of the Bible there are also the tree of life and a river
In a book on construction there is a blueprint at the beginning of the book and a photograph of a completed building at the end
In this divine book of God's construction there is a 'blueprint' at the beginning, and at the end there is a 'photograph' of God's building
The little serpent is here all the time, but the seed of the woman, Christ, has bruised the head of the serpent
The bride in Genesis 2 is a type of the church, while the city, the New Jerusalem, is the fulfillment of the bride
Beside the tree of life there was the flowing river, and in the flow of the river there was not clay but gold, pearl, and precious stones
The tower of Babel in Genesis 11 and the two cities of Pharaoh in Exodus 1 were built with bricks made of burnt clay
According to our experience, when we take Jesus into us as the tree of life, something within us starts to grow
A brother may like to play basketball, but by transformation by the flowing of the life of Christ, his playing of basketball will cease
Teachings help us to realize that we need Christ as life, and good, proper teachings minister Christ to us as life
Christ and Christ alone is the substance, the element, and all the ingredients of the spiritual food, so we have to take Christ
Our sins were washed away by His blood and He came in not only as the Savior the Redeemer and the Lord but also as the lifegiving Spirit
He is the Spirit in our spirit, so we are one spirit with Him, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Regardless of the position of our troublesome mind, terrible emotion, and stubborn will, they are still a problem
We can have a change in our thinking, a change in our concept, but our mind will still remain the same in nature
In this country in the past few years, by God's mercy we have seen the gold, the pearls, and the precious stones
For the church in your locality to be thoroughly built up, all the dear ones must pay their full attention to the eating of Christ
When a grain of sand wounds the oyster and remains in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand
After God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life, indicating that man should eat the tree of life
Also Revelation 22:14 says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life'
In contrast to the Brethren, the Pentecostals mainly emphasize chapter twelve and other verses of chapter fourteen
The books of Ephesians and Romans are wonderful and excellent, but neither of these two books has the phrase theirs and ours
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
John 223 says Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did
Sanctification is more than holiness; it is holiness 'to us,' not in a doctrinal way, but in a subjective and experiential way
Suppose a brother has a wife who gives him a hard time, irritating him, humiliating him, and causing him to lose his temper
As they look in the windows and at the showcases, they get captured, and eventually they buy some of the up-to-date fashions
When they wear them, they lose their sanctification; instead of experiencing sanctification they experience worldliness
Even the length of our hair is not a matter of regulation or outward correction; it is a matter of sanctification
We may have read many messages on 1 Corinthians, but not one of them told us that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit within us
Corinthians 16:18 says, 'For they refreshed my spirit and yours,' and 2 Corinthians 7:13 says, 'His spirit has been refreshed by all of you'
Corinthians tells us that we all have been called into the fellowship, the participation, of this Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit
He has been made our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future
From the verses in the Scripture reading above we can see the unique matters of eating, drinking, growing, transformation, and building
A sinful brother committed incest with his stepmother, so Paul told the Corinthians to remove the evil man from among them
Following this is the dealing with the eating of things sacrificed to idols with the vindication of Paul's apostleship and authority
They were sick with divisions, sinfulness, lawsuits, wrongness toward marriage, idol sacrifices, and many matters
It is hard to hear a message in Christianity telling us that 1 Corinthians is for eating, drinking, growing, transforming, and building
It may be all right to go for several days without taking a shower, but it is not all right to go without drinking
Paul goes on to say, 'But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all'
Mothers know that the way to help their children to grow is not by teaching them but by feeding them three or more times a day
They had to realize that they all had taken Christ as their Passover, not only for redeeming but also for feeding
Now at the Lord's table when we eat the bread, there is a portion for God, and there is a portion for all of us
To have the remembrance of a certain loved one is to exercise our mind to recall the goodness and virtues that person had
Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood' ; 'this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me'
A new element is added into us, nourishing us, discharging all the old things and replacing them with something new
We do not know how he received the concept of gold, silver, and precious stones, but this concept is very scriptural
It begins with three kinds of precious materials-gold, bdellium, precious stones-and it ends with gold, pearl, and precious stones
The difference between the two is that the bride in the beginning is only a type, a prefigure, a foreshadowing, of the coming bride
Her picture gives you a general idea of who she is, but when the person herself comes, you know her more definitely
If you tell children about a dog they may still wonder what a dog is but if you show them a picture of a dog immediately they get the idea
When God brought the cat to Adam, he might have looked at himself and said, 'I have two legs, but this creature has four legs
In Christianity we heard many messages telling us that we were sinful and that Christ died on the cross for our sins
12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Few Christians realize that regeneration is not only for our salvation but also for the producing of the church
Only the life-giving Spirit with the life of Christ can make people a part of Christ to produce His counterpart, His increase
Ephesians, a book on the church, does not say anything about teachings or gifts for the producing of the church
For the church to be the increase of Christ, we do not need the knowledge collected from teachings or the manifested gifts
In principle, the treasure hidden in the field must be composed of gold and precious stones, items which are transformed substances
Some people consider that we need gifts such as divine healing, but for a person to receive divine healing will not help him to grow in life
Some people lay hands on others, telling them to say, 'Praise Jesus,' quickly over and over, or to speak nonsensical syllables
Pentecostal Christianity, reacting to the deadness of fundamental Christianity, cares mainly for the gifts, especially tongue-speaking
Some people speak in tongues by uttering nonsensical syllables or by repeating the same syllables over and over
In an editorial on the first page of one issue, the writer said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers
Still, because the writer was one hundred percent for tongue-speaking, he encouraged everyone to speak in tongues and not to doubt
Do you believe that Peter and the others doubted their experience of speaking in tongues on the day of Pentecost?
In the evening the same tongue may be spoken and interpreted as, 'Be on the alert; there will be an earthquake'
Later in one of the meetings of that congregation an American woman in her fifties stood up and spoke a short sentence in a socalled tongue
A young American-born Chinese of about twenty years of age stood and interpreted her short tongue-speaking with a long interpretation
Some have said that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the gifts, but he strongly disagreed with this
John also tells us that Christ is the unique grain of wheat who fell into the earth, died, and produced many grains
There is only the flow of the living water, and on either side of the river of life grows the tree of life, producing twelve fruits
After chapter three, however, chapter four is necessary because for transformation the Spirit alone is not adequate
In cooking certain foods fifteen minutes in the oven may be good enough but sometimes we need three hours and sometimes we need a whole day
When he was on the earth working for the Lord, ministering something to the Lord's children, he was always being put to death
When we were concerned for a young brother, we recommended a sister to him because we thought she was the best one for him
Although we may warn a brother about a sister's peculiarities, he still may consider that he can bear them out of love for her
We may warn him not to have so much trust in himself, that he will be unable to bear such a one and will probably suffer
Such a brother may still marry the peculiar sister, but after only three days he may come back for fellowship with tears on his face
He may say that he prefers to have the windows of his house shut, but she insists to have them open, and he does not know what to do
We, the older ones who cared for the younger ones, all became disappointed, so we took our hands off their situation
We may expect that the brothers coordinating with us will be nice, humble, not too slow nor too quick, just fitting our situation
We will say, 'Praise the Lord, the slow one is just as good as the quick one, and the quick one is just as good as the slow one
There is not one woman on this earth who can be the best wife, and there is not one man on this earth who can be the best husband
If we are clear to such an extent, we can then shut our eyes and leave the matter of marriage to the hand of the Lord
When some of the experienced saints speak about the Lords grace and power we have the realization that they have something real and weighty
The Lord's recovery is the Lord's doing to bring us back to the beginning-to life and the transformation of life
It is by this life with transformation by life that the Lord can have a proper church life for the preparation of His bride
In this country it is easy to see various movements, and some reports of them appear in the newspapers and magazines
Rather, there are suffering, troubling, perplexing, putting to death, and consuming, and there are no miraculous answers to prayer
Romans 82829 says And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to His purpose
If we put these two verses together, we can see that all things work together for good that we might be conformed to the image of Christ
Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless'
If we still take the way of teaching, we are children, tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching
Today he appreciates the church very much, but when he visits a certain place, some may come to him to teach him
The young brother may be convinced by this talk, and he may join this foot-washing group and forget about the church
If there is the possibility that we will be carried about by the wind of doctrine, this proves that we are still childish
Paul clearly points out that if we are childish, we will be carried away by the teachings, and we will 'play' with the gifts
We cannot say that teachings and gifts are wrong if they are genuine, but some teachings and gifts are not genuine
On the day of Pentecost, no one asked Peter to turn his tongue, exercise his jaw, and utter anything but his own language
They may then lay hands on your head and tell you to turn your tongue, exercise your jaw, and speak anything but your mother tongue
Because this went on for a long time, a second brother, speaking in Chinese, told the first brother to speak anything, even nonsense
Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless
One traditional teaching concerning the meetings says that there are nine gifts as manifestations of the Spirit
Visions and dreams are also the manifestation of the Spirit, but these two items are not mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12
In the same way, the traditional teaching in Christianity tells people that the fruit of the Spirit is only nine items
Galatians 52223a says But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness meekness selfcontrol
Many other kinds of spiritual virtues are also not mentioned, but every kind of spiritual virtue is a fruit of the Spirit
Verse 1 of chapter fourteen says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all'
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
Many in Christianity teach people to wait until they have an inspiration without inspiration one should not take any action in the meetings
Many of us have heard this kind of teaching but Paul did not say Whenever you come together you must wait until you have the inspiration
Again, this list is simply an illustration, and in this illustration Paul put tongues and interpretation as the last items
The traditional teaching of Christianity is strong to tell us that to prophesy is simply to predict, to speak something beforehand
Verse 4 continues And my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power
Paul determined not to know anything but Christ, and second, his preaching was not with enticing words but in demonstration of the Spirit
In his ministry he determined to know nothing but Christ, so no doubt the way he functioned was to minister Christ to people
In all the Epistles of the apostles there are nearly no predictions other than certain prophecies of the coming back of the Lord Jesus
The prevailing, tongue-speaking sister immediately made a prediction and told the husband not to prepare a funeral
In the New Testament and in the whole Bible, prophesying first means to tell for, to speak something for, the Lord
Isaiah contains much telling for and telling forth the Lord, although, of course, there is also some foretelling
The brother tells something for the Lord Jesus, and at the same time he also tells forth, he declares something about the Lord Jesus
We must declare to the universe, to all the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, that the Lord Jesus is our life
Today He was with us all the time, in our kitchen, our dining room, our living room, and even when we went shopping
We say something for Christ with the demonstration of the Spirit, not in a weak, timid way, but in a strong way
When we come to the meeting, we exercise our spirit to say something for Christ, to say something about Christ
In no other book are these two matters-the Christian daily life and the church meetings-more fully and adequately covered
When they get into this book, they become distracted, puzzled, and even perplexed by these eleven great problems
1:2 speaks of the church of God which is in a locality, Corinth, like the church in Chicago, Atlanta, or Detroit
The persons in this church are sanctified and called, not called sinners or even called believers, but called saints
Even when we visit our relatives, we have to be the calling ones, all the day calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
In this weeping book there are two wonderful, joyful verses: 'I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit
To call 'O Lord Jesus' is refreshing and spiritually enjoyable because when we call on the Lord, we breathe Him in
In Christianity certain teachers teach people that unto us, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God
The fundamentalist teaching in Christianity tells us that as long as we believe in Christ, we are in Christ and we have everything
The fundamentalist teachings are too much at one extreme, and the Pentecostal teachings are too much at the other extreme
In the morning someone may serve us breakfast, but we have to go to the table and use our hands and mouth to eat
There may be thirty pounds of beef on the table, but if we eat only two and a half ounces, only that much is ours
Corinthians 1:2b says 'With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours'
All the Corinthians were baptized in the Holy Spirit, but at least some of the Corinthians had never spoken in tongues
Do not listen to the traditional teachings of today's Christianity, whether they are Pentecostal or fundamentalist
Whether or not we have spoken in tongues, as long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, we were baptized in the Spirit
To prophesy is to speak something for Christ, to speak something about Christ, and to minister Christ to others
Rather he always exercises his mind perhaps to consider some verses of the Bible and afterward to consider the elders and the other brothers
When he examines the brothers, not one is good to him, and when he looks at the sisters, he considers that every one is worldly
To have the full release of the spirit is the right way to meet, but this needs the proper Christian life in our daily walk
If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all'
The words church and churches are used nine times in chapter fourteen, and build, built, and building are used seven times
Day by day we live by Christ, we enjoy Christ, we experience Christ, we gain Christ, we are filled with Christ, and we are full of Christ
John 10:9 says, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
Today the Lord Jesus is the door, not for us to go into the heavens but for us to get out of the denominations
To be separate from others by being in the pasture is right, but to be divided from others by being in the folds is wrong
In the oldness of Judaism, there were many things, including the law, letters, doctrines, knowledge, and the Ten Commandments
If there are ten brothers we may all be divided into ten individual groups because we all have different opinions about the Ten Commandments
In the life of Jesus, there are no opinions, but if we care for anything other than life, we will be divided and divisive
The Brethren started the church life in 1828, but after only ninety years, they were divided into one hundred fifty divisions
If we all are for life, we are one, but if we are for doctrines, gifts, or anything other than life, we will be divided
Jesus is the door, not for us to go into heaven, but for us to come out of anything that holds us back from the church
One brother may think that the other brother's hair is too long, while the other brother thinks that the first brother's hair is too short
One brother thinks that the other should shave, but the other brother thinks that to shave too often is worldly
Hallelujah, we have God's life, we have God's nature, and we have the position as God's children to express Him
Long hair or short hair, wide neckties or narrow neckties, shaving or not shaving-all these things make no difference
To speak doctrinally about loving one another is very easy but when we are put together practically what happens to our love for one another
We may say that we do not like a certain kind of meeting because it is too noisy, but what if the Lord Jesus likes it?
Their thought was that the word of God is so holy that it should be preached only in a sanctuary, a holy place, and not in a common place
Whether the meeting is noisy or quiet, orderly or disorderly, full of dignity or without any dignity, makes no difference to us
If we care only for Christ, we will have no opinion because we are being perfected into one by and with Christ
Because they appreciated knowledge and gifts, some admired Paul, others appreciated Apollos, and still others treasured Cephas
You have to give up all the teachings, you have to give up all the gifts, and you have to give up all your opinions'
The Lord is going to recover us out of the teachings, out of the gifts, and out of the opinions back to Himself
Perhaps, you may need to take a 'church tour,' traveling through so many so-called churches in order to find a place that fits your taste
Some have said that they are taking the ground of locality in a certain city and that they do not want to have fellowship with others
The brothers in Akron are the local church there, but they should not say that they have nothing to do with the church in Chicago
Due to distance, of course, the saints meeting in Chicago as the church in Chicago cannot meet day by day with the church in Los Angeles
All the local churches in the United States can testify that Los Angeles never exercises any control over the other churches
The church in Akron may have something better, and through fellowship the local churches can again receive the benefit
There may be only ten believers living in one city, ten living in a nearby city, and ten more living in another
The ten in one city should be the church in that city, and the ten in the other cities should be the churches in those cities
When they grow from thirty to two hundred, the Lord may lead them to be three separate local expressions in the three cities
In Matthew 1333 the three measures of meal were leavened typifying the situation in Christianity so some say it is scriptural to use leaven
Some say that since the Lord's table is a supper, not a breakfast or a lunch, we cannot have it in the morning
He went to the cross and died there, not merely due to persecution and not for martyrdom but for our redemption
Ephesians 4:3-4a says, 'Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit'
Whether or not we will be one in doctrines in the New Jerusalem, there is no possibility in this age for us all to be one in doctrine
We may illustrate the oneness of the faith with three brothers who are saved in the same summer through the preaching of the gospel
Many Jewish believers still kept their Judaistic concept, and many Greek believers kept certain kinds of Greek philosophy
When we speak of the oneness of the faith faith is objective the things in which we believe not the believing action the believing ability
Using wine or grape juice in the Lord's table is all right, and using either a big cup or a small cup is also all right
If you would take the Lord's table in the morning, that is all right, and if you would take it at midnight, that is also all right
If we would allow something else, even the best things for the Lord, to come in to take the place of the Lord, we are wrong
Regardless of how much she does for her husband, if something comes in to take his place in her heart, she is wrong
Many in Christianity take care of the work in the mission field, in Bible studies, and in helping others, but they do not care for the Lord
The Jewish people thought He was a great man, and they tried to make him a king, but the Lord Jesus withdrew from them
When there is a good speaker, the church buildings are crowded, but when the prayer meeting comes, only a few persons attend
Among so many doctrines, the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans crept into the church in Pergamos
The Roman Catholic Church took many hidden, pagan things as the corrupting factor and hid all these things under the covering of Christ
In two of the last parables in Matthew 13 there are the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great value
In Revelation 2 and 3 there are three categories of eating: eating of the tree of life, eating the hidden manna, and feasting
In the wilderness the children of Israel ate of the manna , and when they came into the good land, they held the feasts
At the beginning of the Bible there was the tree of life, and at the end of the Bible we have the same tree of life
At the beginning of the Bible there were gold, bdellium , and onyx, the precious stones in the flow of the flowing river
At the end of the Bible there are the same materials: gold, pearl, and precious stones built together as a city
Lastly, at the beginning of the Bible there was a bride built up by God, and at the end of the Bible there is also a bride
In the whole universe, according to the record of the Bible, God has only two kinds of works: the work of creation and the work of building
Genesis, the first book of the Bible, is a book of creation, and Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is a book of building
We believe that the last item of God's recovery is the building, because this is the last item, the last point, in the whole Bible
That is not wrong; it is absolutely right to study the Bible, but study should not be merely for the sake of study
In the past few centuries the Lord raised up much mission work to bring His gospel to every corner of this earth
Since the time of Madame Guyon, this has been a great help to many seeking saints, and we again thank the Lord for this
In chapters three, four, and the first half of five, sinners have justification by faith through the blood of Christ
As the members of the Body we must be practical, but regrettably, very few Christians are in the Body life practically
According to the revelation of all the Epistles, however, the Body must be very present, instant, and practical to us
It is regrettable that many Christians take this book of the church merely in a doctrinal way, making the church only a doctrine
If we say that the Presbyterian Church or the Methodist Church is our church, can we truly agree with what we say?
We can fool many people and we can even be cheated by our own mind but something within us is sincere that is our regenerated human spirit
Verse 21 of chapter two says, 'In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
It does not refer directly to a building in the Holy Spirit; the dwelling place of God in the church today is in our spirit
Many sound, fundamental, good, and genuine doctrines are also winds to blow us away from the Body and from the Head
Throughout all the centuries the enemy has subtly utilized doctrines to distract the seeking members from the Body life and from the Head
Verses 15 and 16 say, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
Someone may have been a Christian for many years, and he may know many Christian things, but can he point out where the building is?
When that person feels happy, he will remain in that relationship, but when he feels unhappy, he will pull himself out of it
A large number of Arab countries surrounded this little nation and tried to make a conspiracy against her, but they could not win
And there in the leading cities of the United States and of other countries the Lord Jesus will build up something
When Ezekiel saw the house of God, the Lord said to him, 'Son of Man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet'
His building may not be on a large scale, but here and there in all the leading cities, on a smaller scale the Body will be fully built
All the thirteen million claim to be Jews, but only those two million who went back can say that they are the nation of Israel
As long as a Jew stays in New York, he should not and cannot blame those who say they are the nation of Israel
After seventy years the Lord gave the commandment, and some, a minority, a small number, went back to Jerusalem
Regardless of that, however, the rebuilding of the house of God on this earth was not with the spiritual giants in Babylon
Only the little descendants of the returned captivity, like Mary and Joseph, were very prevailing to bring the Lord to this earth
Whether one is spiritual or not spiritual in Babylon makes little difference, but whether or not he returns makes a great difference
Some people despised and reproached the rebuilding of Jerusalem, saying that what the returned ones were building was a small matter
Egypt gained military and economic skills from Russia, but recently Egypt cut off all its high officials who were in favor of Communism
In a similar way, the recovery of the church life is something of the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes
Through our experiences, many can testify that when we are for the building in our church service, we are so happy
Even to know the Bible does not make us very happy, but when we are coordinated in the church service, we are in the third heaven
There is no need to speak of eighty to a hundred being built up; if only thirty to fifty are built up in a locality, this will shake Satan
Not many Christians, however, know how to apply to the Christian life the things that happened at the end of the history of Israel
At the time of Solomon the temple was built, the glory of God filled the temple, and all the people of Israel were one to worship God
The day of degradation came in once again, and the church was damaged, destroyed, and scattered into captivity
We praise the Lord that at the end time the Lord has come back to recover and to call His people to return to today's Jerusalem
Consider the situation of the people in captivity; even if they had a revival, what good would that have been to the Lord?
The people were one in the holy land, but in captivity they were scattered and divided, some to Syria, some to Egypt, and some to Babylon
While the people were in captivity, some godly ones might have prayed much, asking the Lord to give them a revival
Some have been in Christianity for many years and heard much talk about revival, but they may never have heard about recovery
In the type there were the timid and messed up ones and today in the recovery of the church life we also have some timid and messed up ones
Regardless of how timid the people were, there was still a return, and as long as there was a return there was the recovery
At that time in Babylon there still were a good number of the people of Israel who were more spiritual and godly
If you are not a spiritual person, regardless of how much you go back to Jerusalem, you will still not be spiritual
Regardless of how timid the people were, regardless of how much they were messed up, they were still the returned captivity
Will you still seek to be a godly person, merely looking up to the heavens and praying for America and for other places?
For centuries people have said it is impossible to have oneness among Christians, but today the Lord has worked it out
One hundred, two hundred, and even one thousand different Christians among us with different backgrounds are all one
When we are in our mind, we are divided, but when we forget about our mind and return to our spirit, we are one
By reading some of the books we have published, some dear ones today have picked up the teaching of the ground of locality
We may give up the denominations and come together to practice the church life, but we may do it merely according to doctrine
Regardless of a person's education, degree, or age, if he turns to his spirit, he is simple, like a small child
We have to put everything on the altar-what we are, what we do, what we are able to do, what we have, and what we are for
According to Ezra, they first built the altar and offered on it daily, and then they laid the foundation of the temple
To be recovered means to come back to the spirit, and to come back to the spirit means to come back to the genuine oneness
Regardless of how good a teaching, gift, or practice may be, as along as it is divisive, we must drop it and come back to the oneness
And there, in all the big cities in the United States and in all the leading countries on this earth, the Lord will recover His church
When the church is recovered and rebuilt, the Lord will come back with His glory as the Bridegroom to meet the bride
As we saw in chapter one, the eternal purpose of God is to have a corporate man to express Him and represent Him
Genesis 1:26 clearly tells us that God created man in His own image, and He gave man the dominion, the authority, to rule over all things
In Genesis 2, the tree of life is nothing less than God Himself, and the tree of knowledge is nothing but Satan himself
If we take life, that means we are taking God, but if we take knowledge, we can be sure that we are taking Satan
Jesus Christ died on the cross to create a new man of two peoples, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers
The last book of the Bible Revelation was written after the failure of the new man that is after the failure and degradation of the church
Corinthians 15:45a speaks of the first man, saying, 'So also it is written, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul'
Verse 47 mentions the second man: 'The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven'
We may have been in Christianity for many years, but we never heard of the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child
There is but there is also a verse that says Now the serpent was more crafty than every other animal of the field which Jehovah God had made
The Bible has the serpent, the Bible has scorpions, and the Bible has the lake of fire, but the Bible is not a book of such things
Many teachings we received from Christianity, whether bad or good, right or wrong, sound or unhealthy, are veils over our eyes
When the Lord Jesus came to the earth the first time many publicans sinners and Gentiles came to Him and when they did they saw something
If we tell the Mongolians about the second man, they would learn and be glad to know that such a matter is in the Bible
The entire Bible is under the span of these four men: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child
According to the first of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the church left the first love toward the Lord
Following this, because the church turned from the living, present, and instant Lord Himself to something else, teachings came in
The good teachings came in, but eventually something corrupting, evil, and ruining was hidden in the teachings
Even the date, December 25, was the day that people in the ancient time worshipped the sun and celebrated its birthday
The degraded church, however, says that without such a celebration people cannot appreciate the birth of Christ
Behind any kind of idol there is a demon; if someone has something related to idols in his home, he is in danger of possession by demons
The way the church became degraded was first by leaving her direct love to the Lord, taking care of other things which seemed to be good
We should be careful about saying that the Lord Jesus hates only the evil teachings and not the good teachings
Read these two chapters again and you will see that the Lord Jesus mentions teachings several times, but always negatively
In the garden of Eden there was no teaching; there was not even a Bible of thirty-nine plus twenty-seven books
You may say no, but after a short time a certain doctor, a worldwide famous, great speaker, may come to your town
Those in the 'holiness churches' told people to wear certain colors, have dresses of a certain length, and not to paint their faces
In principle today, they can pull themselves out from any denomination or any group, but they cannot pull themselves out of the church
