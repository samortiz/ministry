   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FAITH OF THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of the workers must have the common faith concerning the Lord's work and His person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These basic truths must be kept in common by us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If any worker has erred in these general principles, the elders should stop him from working.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the major doctrines, there must be the proper scriptural interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone must be the same in these interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proper interpretation of many verses have already been laid down by others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All we have to do is receive them from their hand; there is no need for us to add anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One basic principle in reading the Bible is to simply accept what God's Word says and not add our own thoughts to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In reading the Bible, we should ask, "What has God said?" instead of "Why did God say this?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A citizen of a country does not need to ask why there is a certain law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He only needs to ask what the law of the country is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our question should be "what," not "why."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our attitude toward God's commands should not be one of understanding but of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, due to differences in men's conduct before God, there are differences in biblical interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, in the matter of baptism, many people have been sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they read the Bible, they somehow find the doctrine of sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their doctrine is a result of their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man's interpretation of the Bible has a great deal to do with his attitude before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people come to God's Word with only one purpose: to find an ordinance that would justify their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their goal is to turn God's Word into some law that suits them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, their interpretation of the Bible is all for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person who has never passed through the dealing of the cross cannot read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only those who have passed through the cross can read the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE NEED OF THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come to the need of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first thing we have to mention is the offering of money by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The offerings of the believers are not merely for the support of the workers; they are to supply those who work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, one does not offer to a certain person simply because he is a worker; he offers to that person because he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What he is personally is one matter, and whether or not he works is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as he works for the Lord, he deserves to be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The question is not whether or not he has money, but whether or not he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he works for the Lord, he deserves to be supported.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man paying a rickshaw operator does not ask if he is rich or poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether he is rich or poor has nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as he has worked, he deserves his wages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person cannot say that because a worker has money, he does not need to be supported.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Someone once intended to make an offering to Mr. Bright, a co-worker of Dr. Scofield.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the person next to him said that the Lord would take care of Mr. Bright's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the man took back his offering, and Mr. Bright was left without the support.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Believers should not offer their money just because the workers are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they give because of the worker's poverty, they are not making an offering but are giving alms.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Making an offering is the least that a saved person can do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a saved man does not offer up himself, he is a useless person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man has received grace, there should be a result of offering up all that he has to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not normal for a person to receive grace and not be willing to offer up all that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those whose hearts have been touched by God will give up their money purse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible for a person's heart to be touched by God without his possessions also being touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consecration allows God to touch everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only after God has touched him will love flow out from him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a man has never offered up himself, there will surely not be the outflow of love from him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, there are only two gods in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first is mammon, and the other is the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not love God, we will love mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only when a man loves God will his heart be broadened.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The thing that broadens man's heart the most is the giving of money.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A believer among us attended meetings in a certain denomination for twenty years but never even nodded his head toward another person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Later he offered himself up, and his whole being changed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Previously I was afraid of reporting to others about our financial condition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But today I have turned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a way for others to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more a person offers, the more he will be filled with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These words are for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now let us consider the way to dispense the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Part of the money received in the meetings should be set aside for the local workers and the workers in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a sign of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul praised the Philippians for their grace in this matter Phil 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They continued to fellowship with the apostle in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The condition of the Corinthians was just the opposite; they developed a problem in their fellowship with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, Paul was willing to allow other churches to suffer, rather than ask for any money from the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not use the Corinthians' money because there was a problem with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only when there is fellowship can there be a material offering.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thank the Lord that the brothers in Shanghai have received grace in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The workers from out of town should not misunderstand and think that the church in Shanghai is so rich that it can keep sending money out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The reason the church in Shanghai is able to send money out is because the local workers in Shanghai have received only a little local support.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, the church is able to send out so much.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the grace of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The offerings to individuals should be personally wrapped in an envelope by the offerer, marked with the name of the worker, and dropped into the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The brothers who open the box should then personally hand this offering directly to the receiver.</S>
