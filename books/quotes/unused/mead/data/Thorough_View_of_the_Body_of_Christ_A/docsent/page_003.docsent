   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we offer our worship to You.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We thank You that You always take care of us and gather us, that You even gather us into Your holy name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we again gather into Your holy name tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May Your blood cleanse us, may Your Spirit be with us, and may Your Word be opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we deeply believe that at this very moment You are present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You know that we are nothing and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we are looking to and depending on is You Yourself and Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, lead us tonight, and guide every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do give each one of us a word which will touch the depths of our being, so that we would be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Enlighten us that we may receive Your sustenance within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, may You give us the utterance, the instant word, the fresh light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And we pray that You will release Yourself more and more so that we may be satisfied, and Your Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord Jesus, grant us a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through simple words reveal to us the mystery of Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grant us a thorough vision that we can see Your precious Body clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Be with us in an extraordinary way, and may Your all-pervading Spirit be upon us to touch us and possess us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have not been back here for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have come back, but this time I will not be staying too long, and after I leave, I will not return very soon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So I treasure these four meetings very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have had much consideration before the Lord and felt that I needed to speak some messages which are basic and crucial that will be sufficient for you for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you know how to use them, they can even be adequate for your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A THOROUGH VIEW OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The topic of the messages I am going to speak to you this time is "A Thorough View of the Body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I use the expression thorough view to talk about this matter because concerning the Body of Christ you have heard enough already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You all know that the Body of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not wrong, but this realization is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body is a mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not to mention the Body of Christ, just our little body is extremely mysterious; its mystery lies in its being organic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Look at me standing here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because I am a living person, whether I am speaking or moving, regardless of what my body is doing, there is an organic expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If our little physical bodies are like this, the Body of Christ is like this so much the more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is such an immeasurable and boundlessly great Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He needs a Body of fullness to express Him even more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From this you can realize how mysterious His Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not something that we can study thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, I am looking to the Lord that in these four days I may do my best to give you a thorough view of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this first message tonight we will see the history of the Body of Christ, or the origin of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Tomorrow in the second message we will see the elements, essence, and reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In that message we will really be seeing a thorough view of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In message three we will see the living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the living we ought to have.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, we do not live the life of a sinner, nor do we live the life of a natural person, nor do we merely live the life of a moral person or of an ordinary citizen; we live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we talk about the church life, it is better to speak of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word church has the denotation of a congregation, and a congregation, superficially speaking, does not have anything to do with life; but when the Body is mentioned, it clearly refers to a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, in the fourth message we will see the service of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After we have seen the living in the Body, we will see the service of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE ORIGIN OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we must see the origin of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all know that everyone who is sitting here was born, not manufactured, into being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The idols in the temples are manufactured, not born.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We human beings with our organic bodies are born into being from parents who are human beings like us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This birth is our origin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body of Christ is a totality of all the members of Christ, and we are the members in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, in talking about the Body of Christ, we are all included, both you and I. When I speak about the Body of Christ, I am speaking concerning you and also concerning myself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So when we talk about the origin of such a mysterious matter as Christ and His Body, you and I are both included.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we speak about the origin of the Body of Christ, we are speaking about our own origin.</S>
