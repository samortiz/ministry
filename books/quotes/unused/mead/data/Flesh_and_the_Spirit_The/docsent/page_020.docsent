   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO STEPS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also see that Christ as the Son of God, even as God Himself, has taken two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have to say, "Hallelujah for the two steps which Christ has taken!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, He took a step to become a man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not become a man who was outwardly splendid and attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are flesh, and He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The flesh is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a sense, Christ became something ugly, not in actuality but in form, in likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's nature, His substance, is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the appearance of Christ while He was in the flesh was ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible says that He did not have any form or outward comeliness and that He had no outward beauty Isa 53:2; 52:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing with Him was outwardly attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was in that form for the purpose of bringing our ugly flesh to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He became flesh to crush the flesh and to destroy Satan in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Judicially speaking, both Satan and our flesh have been condemned once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God allowed the flesh to remain with us to help us and force us to turn to Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ took the first step to become the flesh in order to crush the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After this He took a further step.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The last Adam, who was in the flesh, resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of Christians oppose this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They say that Christ is only the Son in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible in 1 Corinthians 15:45b tells us definitely, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even according to our experience, the Christ who is within us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The pure Word tells us that our Christ today is not merely the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before the process of His death and resurrection, He was the Lamb of God, and today in the heavens, He still is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But through the process of His death and resurrection, He is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Spirit so that He can be with us in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Gal 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became flesh to crush our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He took another step to become the Spirit in order to be with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank the Lord for our being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This one spirit is a compound spirit, a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verses like Romans 8:4, 9-10, and Galatians 5:25, it is difficult for the translators to make a decision as to whether the spirit mentioned in these verses is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is hard because it is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to walk according to the spirit, that is, the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this one mingled spirit, we enjoy two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We enjoy the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and we enjoy our spirit with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we need to take care of one thing walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have many questions concerning how we should be and what we should do as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Someone may ask, "Should I go to the movies?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others may wonder what kind of clothes they should wear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Other Christian brothers may consider how long their hair should be.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First Corinthians 11 says that it is a shame for a man to have long hair v. 14 . But how long is long? No one can make a decision concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please do not come to me asking these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have One within us whose name is Counselor Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Go to Him and check with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then you will have the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once a sister asked me how she should deal with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I told her that she did not need to come to me, because she had already received the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She asked me what I meant.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I told her, "The Lord Jesus was with you last night, and He said something to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He already told you that you shouldn't talk to your dear husband in that way."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one told me her story, but I saw the "heavenly television" concerning this sister's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After I told her this, she admitted that the Lord had spoken to her in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I told her to take care of what the Lord had told her.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said, "The Lord Jesus is within you, and you have His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now walk according to the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we walk according to the spirit, there will be no problems.</S>
