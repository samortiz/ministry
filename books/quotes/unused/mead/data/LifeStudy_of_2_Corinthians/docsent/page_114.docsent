   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND UNBELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 6:14-16 the apostle uses five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: no partnership, no share, between righteousness and lawlessness; no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; no harmony, no concord, between Christ and Belial; no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial Satan the Devil , and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 14 Paul says, What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There should not be any sort of contact between righteousness and lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There should be no relationship, no partnership, between them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, light and darkness have nothing to do with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They cannot have any fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As believers, we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have fellowship, or intimate friendship, with unbelievers, that kind of friendship is fellowship between light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For a believer to marry an unbeliever is for that believer to have fellowship of light with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 15 Paul continues, And what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Belial is another name for Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There can be no harmony between Christ and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We believers are of Christ, and the unbelievers are of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have friendship with unbelievers, that means we are making harmony between Christ and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A believer does not have any part with an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, And what agreement has the temple of God with idols?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see that there can be no agreement between the temple of God and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unbelievers have idols, but we are the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How then can there be any close relationship between believers and unbelievers?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE TEMPLE OF THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 16 Paul says that we are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the living God, God dwells in us and walks in us to be our God in a subjective way that we may partake of Him and be His people, experiencing Him in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says that we are the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church and not merely objective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A living God and a living church live, move, and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The living church is the house and the household of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people 2 Cor 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is our situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is living in us, dwelling in us, and walking among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is our God, and we are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>SEPARATED AND RECONCILED</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 17 Paul exhorts the Corinthians, saying, Wherefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean, and I will welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be separated is to be reconciled, to be brought back, to God 5:20 in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words what is unclean denote that which belongs to lawlessness, darkness, Belial, and idols, as listed in verses 14 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By not touching such unclean things we are separated to God and reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, to come out from their midst and be separated is to be brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are separated in this way, God welcomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The words, I will welcome you, point to God s glad receiving of the believers who are fully reconciled, brought back, to Him.</S>
