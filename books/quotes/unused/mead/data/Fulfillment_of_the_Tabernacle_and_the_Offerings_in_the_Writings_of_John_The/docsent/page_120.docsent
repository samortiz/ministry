   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38 THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we come to chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may seem to us that what is recorded in this chapter is not of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, this chapter is crucial, for it is a link that connects chapters one through twelve with chapters fourteen through twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Brief Sketch</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapters one and two of John's Gospel give us a brief sketch of the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter one may be considered a prologue to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in chapter two we see that the principle of life is to change death into life 2:1-11 and that the goal of life is to raise up the house of God that had been destroyed and enlarge it into the mysterious and mystical Body of Christ 2:12-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, in these two chapters we have the prologue to the entire Gospel, and we see the principle and goal of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nine Cases</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapters three through eleven we have nine cases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These cases indicate that all of our needs have been met by the One who came that we may have life 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regeneration is actually the first step of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These nine cases depict one complete person who is in the new creation, a person who has gone from regeneration to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Way for the Church to Be Enlarged</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter twelve we see that these nine cases result in a house at Bethany, which represents the church life in miniature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that out of the nine cases the church life is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the church life in John 12 is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In quality it is adequate, but in quantity it is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With the miniature of the church life in Bethany we see service with Martha, love with Mary, and the testimony with Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through the testimony of the resurrected Lazarus, many people were drawn to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter twelve of John a large crowd was drawn to the Lord v. 18 . However, He told His disciples that He was not willing to accept exaltation from the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus knew that exaltation cannot multiply the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church life can be multiplied only through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Lord refused to take the opportunity to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, as a grain of wheat, He said that He would fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains for the enlargement of the church life: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" v. 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's death was also for His glorification and for the glorification of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the reason the Lord said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified" v. 23 . It was also the reason He prayed, "Father, glorify Your name" v. 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the Lord's death was the judgment of the world and its ruler, Satan: "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out" v. 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regarding His death, the Lord went on to say, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself" v. 32 . This reveals that through His death many would be drawn to the Lord in order to be regenerated and resurrected into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in this way that the church is enlarged.</S>
