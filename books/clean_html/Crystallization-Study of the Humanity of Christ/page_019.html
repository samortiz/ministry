<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Creating the One New Man</H2><P>On the cross He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances to create in Himself the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man (Eph. 2:15). He created the one new man in Himself as the element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Reconciling All Things to God</H2><P>Colossians 1:20-22 reveals that through His death Christ reconciled all things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, to God. Hebrews 2:9 says that He tasted death on behalf of everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Christ's Death Ministering to His Believers Eternal Life and Making Him One with Them</H2><P>In John 6:51-56 blood and flesh refer to Christ's humanity (Heb. 2:14). Christ's blood being separated from His flesh indicates death, and eating and drinking denote receiving. Christ's death through the shedding of His blood ministers to His believers eternal life and makes Him one with them (John 3:14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Initiating for Us a New and Living Way</H2><P>Through His death He initiated for us a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies through the splitting of His crucifixion (Heb. 10:19-20; Matt. 27:51a). Christ's crucifixion split the veil, that is, the human flesh. That veil had cut off the way for people to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God directly. But since Christ split the veil through His death, the new and the living way is opened for us.</P>
