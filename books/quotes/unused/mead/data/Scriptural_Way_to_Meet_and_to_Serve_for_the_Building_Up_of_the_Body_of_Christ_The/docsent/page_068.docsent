   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE PRACTICAL WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 10:5-6; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26, 4, 12 BUILDING UP THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY VISITING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we will consider the practical way in the Lord s recovery to carry out the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The practical way is first to build up the practice of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes Luke 10:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the time we first began to speak on this matter, we have not expected all the saints in the recovery to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is impossible that all the saints would go out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may be too old, some may be weak, and some may be very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, so many are needed to take care of other aspects of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to our budget, only one fourth of the saints who meet in the churches are expected to pick up the burden to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Out of one thousand, two hundred fifty may go out, and the other seven hundred fifty may remain home to pray for them and support them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not expect that everyone in the church would go door-knocking, but we do expect that preaching the gospel in this way could be built up as a practice in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will take time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sufficient time is needed to build up anything as a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are now only at the initial stage of building up this good practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have the confidence that this will eventually be built up among so many in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A good number of the lovers of Jesus Christ will pick up the burden and be willing to sacrifice all they have, all they are, and all they can do to visit people with the heavenly gospel by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe the Lord will build up such a practice in every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, I say again that it is not possible that all of the church people will do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BUILDING UP THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The practical way for the new way is also to build up the home meetings and the group meetings Acts 2:46; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meetings in the homes of the believers are the basic factor of the building up of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The building up of the local church does not depend on the big meetings; it depends upon the home meetings of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A number of the messages I have spoken on this matter have been published in several small books see Key Points on the Home Meetings; The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings; and The Home Meetings The Unique Way for the Increase and the Building Up of the Church .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that especially the young people would spend some time to get into these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have stressed the meetings in the believers homes since I first shared on the change of the system in the church life in October of 1984, and I would still stress this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEED OF A PROPER TECHNIQUE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both to knock on people s doors and to set up meetings in the new believers homes are not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot do them in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People knock on doors for purposes other than gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To visit anyone, one must knock on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, when you go out to knock on the door of a stranger for the purpose of gospel preaching, you may be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To knock on people s doors in this way requires you to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be scolded or rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If this happens, you should rejoice Acts 5:40-41; 13:50-52 , but to rejoice at that time will be difficult if you are not enjoying the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our earlier days we went out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we did not see much result.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our way was wrong, mostly due to our long speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we have found out that the secret to preaching the gospel is that a long speaking is not needed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The shorter and the more to the point the speaking is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This way of speaking will bring you success.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may feel that we are helping the saints to preach the gospel by a technique rather than by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They may question whether we believe that it is the technique or the power of the Holy Spirit which can save people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we have not borne much fruit as a result of our way in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where was the power of the Holy Spirit then?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit was there and His power was there, but it was not available.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Electricity may be used as an illustration of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may claim to have electricity, but it may not be available to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We surely need a technique to install the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regardless of how much electricity there is, you still need a wire to connect the power plant with your home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, you need an electrician to exercise his technique to install the wire and switches correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the electricity is installed, you only need to go to the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then the electricity becomes available.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not the technique which operates; it is the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the electricity is so available in your home because you hired the electrician with the proper skill and technique to install the wires.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To read The Mystery of Human Life and present the keys in it is the best way to install the wires and switches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever you go to use this way, the heavenly electricity is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The power of the Holy Spirit will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not emphasize the technique, but to have the power of the Holy Spirit requires a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To talk too much or to argue with people frustrates the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some who depended on the power of the Holy Spirit without the proper technique may have only seen a few people saved, but some young sisters under our training have baptized five people in one evening.</S>
