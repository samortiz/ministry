   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Care for the Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another aspect we need to pay attention to is that all the new believers can immediately take care of the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we should place a few strong brothers to work together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A brother who has been saved for a number of years should coordinate with them and take care of them by leading them step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have to show the new believers that as they have already believed in the Lord, they are priests before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the priests must have a service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today this service before God is to serve either the unbelievers or the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How well the new believers do in this matter depends altogether on how well you take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Laboring on the Fifty-two Topics</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone knows now that fifty-two topics have been prepared for edifying the new believers each year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From these fifty-two topics we will prepare one topic each week to speak on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The older brothers need to be very familiar with these topics and should practice them themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After they have practiced them, they have to lead the new believers to practice also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, they have to become very familiar with the new believers because many of these fifty-two topics stress the matter of conduct, and therefore they require concentrated effort to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After they have done it themselves, they can know the real situation with the new brothers so that they can encourage or even urge them to do it also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not something we can take care of merely by listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just listening to messages will not suffice; there needs to be the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to reach the point where we can say, "I have to practice it myself.''</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, on the one hand, you have to preach this message to them, and on the other hand, there must be brothers who will make the effort to deal with them concerning the particular topic each week.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Go and seek them out, urge them, make them decide, and make them practice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With many problems, it is not a matter of just one visitation, but a matter of caring for them for several weeks or months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the matter of reading the Bible and prayer, you have to see whether in fact they have read the Bible in an adequate way, and whether they have progressed in their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church needs to lay great stress on these matters before she can be brought to a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, I hope that we, especially the co-workers, would see that it is for this reason that I stressed that the problem today is not a matter of knowledge but a matter of taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the local churches need to do this wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since this work is so heavy, we cannot let it pass by carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being a Master Builder</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way we are taking today is absolutely different from our way in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the workers should not do the work, but the workers should cause others to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this clear?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the workers are always working by themselves, this matter can never be done well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I say again that if you go out to work and only you yourselves are working, you have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul not only worked by himself; he was also a master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to learn to work, and you also need to learn to be a master builder who leads other brothers and sisters to work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way we should work with the unbelievers as well as with the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are enough things to keep you busy just with the new believers alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to learn before God how to lead many brothers one by one to give make-up lessons to these new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These brothers should go one by one to the homes of the new believers and examine how well they are practicing the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should check carefully one by one whether or not the lesson was practiced that week.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The brothers should exhort the new believers to read the Bible every day and should check to see if they have read it the day they visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not a matter of whether or not the message was spoken; it is a matter of whether or not, having heard the word, the new believers have practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The brothers must suggest that they use a prayer notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They then need to go and check how their prayer has been and whether or not they have written names in their notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One brother may have written down five names and another may have written down five thousand names.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What should the brothers do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is the one with five names right or is the one with five thousand names right?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brothers should advise them that they should not write down five thousand names; that is too many.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to arrange things one by one and show them how things are arranged.</S>
