<h2 class=head2>Redemption and Life-imparting</h2><p>The Lord’s death and resurrection are a matter not only of Christ imparting Himself to us but also of His redemption. By His death Christ redeemed and recovered us, bringing us back to God. However, redemption is not all; redemption is for imparting life, just as cleaning a cup is for the purpose of filling it. In order to use a cup in the way we intend, we must clean it; then after cleaning it, we can fill it. Christ’s work is in this principle. After He redeemed us, He fills us with Himself as life. In this way, redemption and life-imparting always go together.<p>John 19:34 says, “One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.” Two things flowed out of the Lord’s side: blood and water. The blood is mentioned first and then the water. The blood is for redeeming and cleansing, and the water signifies the imparting, the life-giving, of Christ. In this verse, redemption comes first and life-imparting is second, just as we must clean a cup before we can fill it. This is because John 19 shows us the process of redemption and filling. Redemption, however, is supplementary to God’s goal; it is not the original goal. In the process, Christ needed to redeem us before He could fill us, but God’s original goal is that man would be filled with His life.<p>At the Lord’s table there are also two items: the bread and the cup. The bread is of fine flour from wheat, and the cup is of wine. The cup represents the redeeming blood of Christ, and the bread speaks of the imparting of Christ Himself. Of these two items, the bread is the goal, and the cup is a supplementary item. Because of the accomplishing of Christ’s process, we can testify at the Lord’s table that we are one with the Lord; this is signified by the bread, which comes first. Our testimony is our oneness with Him, as seen in the bread, the loaf, the body of Christ. Following this, we declare to the universe that we, the fallen race, can be one with the Lord because of His redemption. As fallen, sinful, dirty, evil people, we can be one with the holy One by His blood. The cup, therefore, is supplementary to the main item, the main testimony, which is the bread. Although we were sinful, dirty, and fallen, we are one with Him and one in Him because He has shed His blood for us. Therefore, at the Lord’s table we first partake of the bread and then we share the cup.<p>We must always keep in mind that in the Lord’s death and resurrection there is redemption and the impartation of Christ. In John 19 redemption is signified first, but this is not the most important thing; it is part of the process as an additional matter. The foremost matter is the life-imparting aspect that enables us to be one with Him. The imparting of life always requires redemption. Without Christ’s redemption, it is impossible for Him to impart His life into us. Similarly, without cleansing it is impossible for a cup to be filled up; the filling of a cup includes its cleansing. Therefore, the imparting, the life-giving, of Christ includes His redemption. It is by redemption and life-imparting that the created and fallen man is made one with God.<h2 class=head2>The Increase of Christ</h2><p>In John 3:29-30 John the Baptist said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease.” The bride here is the increase of Christ just as Eve, the wife of Adam, was the increase of Adam. Originally, God did not create a man and a woman at the same time. God created only a single man, a bachelor. However, God said that it was not good for the man to be alone (Gen. 2:18). Man needed an increase, a counterpart to match him. God took a rib out of Adam, and that part became Eve, his counterpart, his increase (v. 22). After that, if we were to look at Adam, we would see not Adam alone but Adam with a wife as his increase. Before His death and resurrection Christ was single; He was alone. In His resurrection He gained His increase as the bride to match Him.<p>John 12:24 tells us that the one grain of wheat fell into the earth and died to produce many grains as the increase of Christ. Chapter fifteen of the same Gospel speaks of the many branches which are the increase of the vine (vv. 1-5). In John 17 the Lord prayed that all of His believers might be one (v. 21). The many grains are crushed and ground into fine flour to be blended together as one loaf, one Body. This indicates that the oneness mentioned in the Lord’s prayer in John 17 is for the Body. All the believers of Christ must be one, and this oneness is for the Body. In addition, in 20:17 the Lord spoke of “My brothers.” After His resurrection, He told Mary to go to His brothers, who are the reproduction, the duplication, of Himself. The many brothers are blended and built together to become one Body signified by the bread. This is the duplication, the reproduction, of Christ.<h2 class=head1>MAN BROUGHT INTO GOD</h2><p>The last important point revealed in the four Gospels is that man is brought into God. By His incarnation, God was brought into man; God was made one with man. Now by Christ’s redemption and life-imparting, man is made one with God. God is now one with man, and man is one with God. Not only we are human but Christ also has the human nature. He is God in man and man in God. In this way, God has accomplished His work. He brought God into man to make God one with man, and He also brought man into God to make this man one with God. Now man and God, God and man, are one.<p>Therefore, it is not easy to say where we are. While we are on this earth, we are also in the heavenly places. This is why Colossians 3:3 tells us that our life has been hidden with Christ in God. We are in the heavenlies because we are one with God. At the same time God is in us on the earth. We may illustrate this with electric lamps. Without electricity the lamps are separated from the electric generator and from one another. In the electricity, however, all the lamps are one with the generator, and the generator is one with the lamps. By Christ’s incarnation God has been brought into man, and by His redemption and life-imparting, man has been brought into God. Now God and man, man and God, are one. This is the meaning of our being in Christ and our abiding in Him.<p>These are truly high and wonderful matters. We must realize Christ’s work to the extent that we are clear about these truths, which are mostly neglected by Christianity today. May the Lord reveal these truths to us! May He remove the veils from our eyes and grant us this vision!<p>The above points are the depth of the meaning of the four Gospels. By His incarnation, Christ brought God into man, and with Him there was the kingdom of God. Then, by His redemption and life-imparting, He brought man into God; He made us one with God. Now we are not merely men but God-men, men mingled with God. We are one with Him and one with one another. Therefore, He is the Head and we are the Body. Hence, we can now live a life exactly as He lived on this earth. This is the depth of the real meaning of the four Gospels. If we read the four Gospels from this point of view, we will be able to understand them more deeply.
