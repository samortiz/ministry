   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter from Hankow and was filled with unspeakable joy!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My living in the past several months has really been in a black tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have passed through many dangers, but thankfully the Lord's presence protected and constantly comforted me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since I left Wu-Sung on October 31 for Hangchow, I stayed in town for fourteen days, and then I followed the people here from Hangchow on the fifteenth.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am still planning to go to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope God will allow me to go and will open a way for me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I think that Miss Chang must be with you; please greet her for me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where is Miss Wang?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I miss her!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though I am in this environment, I am together with you sisters every day in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I no longer have a home, so what will I do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God will decide!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That's all for now.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peace in the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Bei Chien-ji in Lien-Shui was attacked and robbed by bandits on January 26.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the brothers and sisters lost some money, clothes, and other possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bandits wanted to shoot the responsible brother, Brother Kao Yu-kun, but he strongly trusted in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He placed his body, soul, and spirit in the Lord's hands and received the Lord's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Afterward, the brothers and sisters did not grieve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, they were exceedingly happy and met every day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Greetings to my respected sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Miss Ruth Lee:</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I received and read your letter of January 22.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In it I learned that you Sister Wang and Sister Chang and Brother Yu-zhi are all well.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was very comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I also heard that the Lord had opened a door for the gospel in Chungking, so I was even more joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord give you more wisdom and power from above so that you may be fishers of men for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We here can only pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The meetings continue as usual by the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The brothers and sisters are beginning to pick up the responsibility because they see that the local church is really theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, they are all learning to go the way of the cross for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brother Nee has been in Shanghai recently, and he is conducting a Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It will last for about two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then he will go abroad to England.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The children's meeting on the Lord's Day morning began last Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is at 262 Hardoon Road.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We were planning to have a baptism soon, but after considering the situation, perhaps we will not be able to do it for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The book The Normal Christian Church Life is still being proofread.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord bless this book so that many believers and workers will know their own position and be able to stand firm in it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If they do, the church and the work will be recovered back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Moreover, the number of people in the Bible study is more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The brothers and sisters in fellowship with us are not the only ones who come; there are also many outsiders, and the meeting place is not big enough.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the Lord bless this conference so that every believer may be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May the grace of the Lord be with you!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Greet the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</S>
