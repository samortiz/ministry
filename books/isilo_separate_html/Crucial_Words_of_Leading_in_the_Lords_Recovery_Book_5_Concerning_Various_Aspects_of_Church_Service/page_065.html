<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12; 2 Cor. 12:15; 8:12-15</h1>
<p>The church is Christ&rsquo;s Body. This is something that many Christians know. However, even though many are familiar with this doctrine, few live the life of the Body of Christ. For this reason, we will briefly mention three aspects of the practice of the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING AN ORGANISM OF LIFE<br />
AND EVERY BELIEVER NEEDING<br />
TO FUNCTION ORGANICALLY</h2>
<p>In order to practice the Body life, we first need to see that the Body is a living entity, an organism of life. Hence, every member in the Body should exercise his function organically. For example, the many members in our physical body are not the result of organization or arrangement. Every member has its respective function from birth. Our physical life is the organic function of all the members in our physical body. When I speak, apparently I am exercising only my throat, lips, and tongue, but actually my eyes, shoulders, and the rest of my body are all coordinated to enable me to speak. I am not a robot. I am a living person, and I speak living words with the coordination of all the members in my body. However, whenever we think of the church, we are unable to drop the natural concept of a social gathering. We think that the church is an organization, a mere collection of people. This is not the church.</p>
<p>We need to know that our being members of the church is not because we are Christians who were baptized and have joined a group. We are members of the church because we have been regenerated. In addition to our human life we have received the Lord Jesus, the living God, into our inner being as life. This is what makes us members of the church. Regeneration does not involve what the Chinese proverbs refer to as &ldquo;correcting one&rsquo;s errors and making a fresh start&rdquo; or &ldquo;being dead to yesterday&rsquo;s mistakes and being reborn today.&rdquo; Regeneration is the addition of another life into us. When we believe into the Lord, God&rsquo;s life enters into us. Regeneration enables us to be God&rsquo;s children and members of Christ&rsquo;s Body. It is God&rsquo;s life within us that enables us to have an organic union with one another.</p>
<p>Although we cannot see this union, we nevertheless have illustrations of this union. For example, the many light bulbs in the meeting hall may not appear to be related to one another, but the electricity within each light bulb is the same. Through this connection, the union of electricity, all the light bulbs are connected with the power plant and are one entity; they have the same electricity flowing through them. In this electricity, the light bulbs become one with one another. Apart from electricity, the light bulbs are not related to one another. This is a picture of all those who are saved. Before we were saved, we were sinners who were unrelated to one another. But after we were saved, the life of God, like electricity, entered into us, and we thus became one entity in the life of God. This is the reason that we come together: we are an organism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Way Damaging<br />
the Organic Function of the Saints</h2>
<p>From church history we see that the church became degraded shortly after the time of the apostles. The church became degraded because it departed from its function as an organism in God&rsquo;s life and fell into the organization of human society. In Catholicism there are bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and a pope above the deacons. In the same principle, Protestantism has many levels of rank. History shows that religious organizations have damaged the organic function of many members in Christ&rsquo;s Body; human organization has annulled the organic function of many members. In most religious meetings one person speaks and the rest listen. This way of meeting has only a few benefits but brings in much damage and has many drawbacks.</p>
<p>It is not easy to give a message to an audience of one thousand people, and not all seminary graduates are good speakers. In recent years a renowned evangelist emerged in America, but this is quite rare. The result of one person speaking a message to an audience is that the function of the saints is annulled. Here is an example. Before this meeting, we could hear many voices in the meeting hall. Many saints were praying and singing in a living way. However, as soon as the speaker stood on the podium, everyone became quiet. This situation is abnormal. When many saints come to the meeting, only their ears are open, but their mouths are shut.</p>
<p>It seems that giving a message helps the saints, but over the long run, it does more harm than good. Many saints among us have listened to messages for more than twenty or thirty years and have become experts in listening to messages. The more they listen, the more they prefer to listen instead of speaking. They give every speaking brother a grade for his message. For example, this brother does not have the right tone, or that brother does not know how to give appropriate examples. Their criticism may be accurate, but after listening to so many messages and criticizing the speakers, can they themselves speak? The purpose of setting up the small group is so that all of us will not only exercise our ears to listen but also exercise our mouths to speak. All the listening experts must learn to speak in the small groups. After hearing so many messages, it is unreasonable that they cannot speak.</p>
<p>Let us use another example. How long does it take for a child to learn to speak? It would be unthinkable for a normal child to listen to others for thirty-six years yet be unable to speak. If we continue to listen without exercising to speak in the church meetings, we will not be able to speak. We must therefore consider this situation and find a way to enable the saints to exercise to speak.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
