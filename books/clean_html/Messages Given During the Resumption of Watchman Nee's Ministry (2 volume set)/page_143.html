<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Simple and Strong in Spirit</H2><P>Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things. The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is. But human methods always lend themselves to further complications. A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly. When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself. Neither a capable mind nor a strong emotion is of any use. The only kind of person who is of use is one with a weighty and strong spirit.</P><P>A man's head occupies one-seventh of the length of his body. If his head took up one-third of his body, he would look ugly. Some people have a good mind, but if their mind is too strong, they will look ugly. However, if such a one matches his strong mind with a strong spirit, he will not look ugly. The most outstanding part of a person is his nose. When a man bumps into a wall or a door, the first thing that hits it is his nose. The most outstanding part of our being ought to be our spirit. We need a large spirit, a strong spirit, a spirit that has been dealt with. If we have this kind of spirit, when others meet us, they will meet our spirit. If what others touch is only our knowledge or our disposition, we are completely useless.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COORDINATION AMONG THE CO-WORKERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Authority of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: Is the coordination among the co-workers based on the ministers in the Body only, or is it based on some other things?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: Yes, there are other things. In the coordination there is also the question of arrangement. On the one hand, coordination is based on the Holy Spirit. The Acts of the Apostles can also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit. The reason it can be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit has the highest authority. The Holy Spirit is like the nerves in the whole body. It is true that the Body is under the direction of the Head. However, the Head rules the Body through the Holy Spirit. Today, the practical outworking of authority lies in the Holy Spirit. The Lord is directing His Body through the Holy Spirit. Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle. Authority is the Lord Himself. The authority that was manifested in Paul, John, and Peter was something given by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit coordinated these men together in different places. The question of authority is a question of being one with the Lord. The principle underlying authority is the oneness with the Lord. The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:2, 4). Only those chosen by the Holy Spirit have the authority.</P><P>The individual work of a worker before the Lord is based on his ministry in the Body. But the overall operation in the Lord's work is based on the Holy Spirit.</P>
