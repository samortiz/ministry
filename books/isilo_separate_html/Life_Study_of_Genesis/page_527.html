After the death of Rachel, Jacob's heart was wholly set upon Joseph. Suddenly and much to his surprise, Joseph was snatched away. Jacob's sons deceived him into believing that Joseph had been devoured by an evil beast (vv. 32-33). When Jacob heard this news, he "rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days" (v. 34). To Jacob, there was nothing more on earth. He was not only broken; he had been robbed to the point where he had nothing left. Although his children tried to comfort him, he refused to be comforted and said, "I will go down into Sheol unto my son mourning" (v. 35, Heb.). Jacob was utterly despondent, and nothing could comfort him. He had lost his heart treasure. How deep and personal was this dealing!</P><P>In principle, sooner or later we all shall pass through such a dealing. Do not be frightened at the prospect of this. Praise the Lord that we not only have chapter thirty-seven, but also chapter forty-seven, where we see a glorious result. Chapter thirty-seven is simply a narrow underpass. Jacob had to walk this narrow underpass and experience a suffering that touched his heart profoundly that he might mature. Nothing in his entire life touched him as personally and as deeply as the loss of Joseph.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(l) The Midianites Bringing Joseph to Egypt<br>and Selling Him to Potiphar</H2><P>Joseph, however, was not lost. God was preserving him in Egypt. Joseph's being brought to Egypt was actually his transfer from "high school" to the "university." In Egypt he would receive his higher education, the education which would prepare him for kingship. Jacob, of course, did not know this. In Jacob's eyes, Joseph had been devoured by a beast. But in God's eyes Joseph was being prepared for kingship. Therefore, God could say, "Jacob, there is no need to mourn. Instead, you must rejoice because your son is in Egypt being prepared to be a king."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_526.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_528.html">Next</a> </body></html>
