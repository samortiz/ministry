   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ITS RELATION TO GOD S GLORY,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS 1</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have covered the different aspects of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message and in the messages following, we shall consider the kingdom in its reality, its nature, its expression, its relation to God s glory, and its unshakableness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ITS REALITY A. Christ as the Seed of Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reality of the kingdom is Christ as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ, the One who is life, has sown Himself as the seed of life into God s chosen ones, who are the soil for growing Him Mark 4:3, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus came to sow Himself as the seed of life into men s hearts, that He might grow in them and live in them and be expressed from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seed of the kingdom is not a matter of power or authority but of the divine life embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the seed of the kingdom is a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This seed of life, which is Christ Himself, is the basic element of the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Mark 4 we see that the Lord Jesus establishes the kingdom by sowing Himself as the seed of life into God s chosen people, the believers, so that the kingdom may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the establishment of the kingdom is absolutely a matter of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To establish the kingdom, therefore, is to grow the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not realize this, we may think that the kingdom is established by our work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The kingdom, however, can be established only by Christ s being sown as the seed of life into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the kingdom is not brought into being by teaching or working; on the contrary, the kingdom is brought into being by Christ s being sown as the kingdom seed into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seed will grow, and the life within it will produce the kingdom in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is wholly a matter of life Christ Himself as the seed of life, the seed of the kingdom, sown into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to make this matter clear, we may use the biological term gene and apply it to Christ as the seed of life, which is the kingdom in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Christ who has been sown into our being is the gene of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that without human genes it is impossible to have human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our birth, being, and existence all came from a gene.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle is the same with the kingdom in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has been sown into us to be the gene of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the kingdom will issue from this gene.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is crucial for us to see that the Christ who has been sown into our hearts is the gene of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has been sown into us as a gene, as a seed of life, to grow, develop, and issue in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Mark 4:26-29 the Lord Jesus tells the parable of the kingdom seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens how, he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The man is the Lord Jesus as the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seed is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This parable reveals that the kingdom of God is a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom is not a matter of lifeless organization through man s wisdom and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kingdom in its reality is a matter of Christ as the seed of life sown into us and growing in us unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. Christ s Expansion</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>as the Enlargement</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kingdom s reality is also seen in Christ s expansion as the enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ s expansion is His growth within us, and His expansion is His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 1:6 tells us that we have been made the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ loosed us from our sins by His blood v. 5 and made us a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The believers redeemed by the blood of Christ have not only been born of God into His kingdom John 3:5 but have also been made a kingdom for God s economy, which is the church Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John, the writer of the book of Revelation, was in the kingdom Rev 1:9 , and all redeemed and reborn believers are also part of this kingdom Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are God s kingdom because we are the expansion of Christ, His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Luke 17:20-21 confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Being questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God comes, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Or, There!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What does it mean to say that the kingdom of God does not come with observation?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It means that the kingdom is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The kingdom is something that cannot be observed by our natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In particular, the kingdom cannot be observed by our natural thinking, which is completely useless in apprehending the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The kingdom of God is not material but spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a spiritual reality it can be realized only by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The kingdom in its reality today is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord says, If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that the kingdom is the reality of the Spirit of God, which is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Spirit is the reality of the Lord Jesus, for the Spirit is His person, and His person is His reality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The kingdom, therefore, is the spiritual realization of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we realize Him spiritually, we have the kingdom in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Luke 17:20-21 the Lord reveals that He Himself is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As the One who is Himself the kingdom, He enters into His believers and grows in them to have an expansion, an enlargement, and this enlargement is the kingdom in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, both the seed of the kingdom and the expansion of the kingdom are the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>C. The Enlargement</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Being the Realm</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>of the Kingdom s Ruling</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus as the seed of life sown into His believers, God s chosen people, and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Its entrance is regeneration John 3:5 , and its development is the believers growth in the divine life 2 Pet 1:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is the church today, in which the faithful believers live Rom 14:17 , and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 to the overcoming saints in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the totality of all the believers shining forth the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The new earth will be a realm in which God will rule over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This ruling realm will be formed by the shining of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hence, the shining of the New Jerusalem will produce a realm for God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the kingdom of God.</S>
