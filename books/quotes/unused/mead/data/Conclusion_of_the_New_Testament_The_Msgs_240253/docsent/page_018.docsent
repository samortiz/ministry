   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Revelation 22:15, the lake of fire will be outside the New Jerusalem, just as Tophet, where the filthy things were Jer 19:11-13 , was outside the old Jerusalem 2 Kings 23:10; Isa 30:33 .</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although the lake of fire has been prepared for the Devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than Satan.</S>
