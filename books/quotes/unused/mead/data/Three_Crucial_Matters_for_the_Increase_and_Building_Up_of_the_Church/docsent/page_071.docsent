   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENTS OF NOURISHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should nourish a person immediately after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not according to our former practice of baptizing someone and then immediately rushing off to baptize another person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From now on we must change our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Immediately after baptizing a person, we should remain in his home and feed him his first meal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we should visit him the day after his baptism and visit him again a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By visiting a new one in this way, we should be able to meet with him at least ten times in the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All we should do is visit and feed the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we visit the new ones, we must feed them with the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can do this with Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we must use Life Lessons organically, not mechanically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must avoid being rigid and using formal methods.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, at the beginning of a home meeting we always say, Today we are going to read Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as we enter a new one s home and sit down, we should exercise our spirit by praying or singing out loud so that our spirit rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should even begin singing when we leave our home and pray while we are in the car.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the meeting will begin before we even arrive at the new one s home.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is best to sing hymns while we are waiting at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when the new one hears us, his spirit will be stirred up, and the home meeting will begin spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we enter the home, the new believer may say, I am so glad you came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have a question to ask you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this mutual asking and answering we may be led to a particular lesson in Life Lessons that is an appropriate response to the question.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not necessary to read the entire lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It may be sufficient to read one point and the important verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After half an hour the new one will be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not leave as soon as the new one is nourished; instead, we should fellowship with him and talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not a worship service; it is the best meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes we will be able to answer a new one s questions simply by reading Life Lessons with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every lesson in Life Lessons has a hymn at the end that is appropriate to sing in coordination with our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we use the hymn, we will not be rigid and our method will not become a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are spreading the gospel in the rural places, we must do things absolutely according to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are taking a new way; we are not doing a reforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, if we apply these methods mechanically, they will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must instead be renewed daily and have a fresh spirit to supply others with Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CHRISTIAN MEETINGS BEING PRAYING, SINGING,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>READING, AND SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Christian meetings we pray, sing, read, and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the elements that compose our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition, there is fellowship, petition, and mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we visit people in their homes, we must stir up their spirit, but in order to do this, our spirit must first be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past when we visited people, we did not understand the matters of exercising our spirit or releasing our spirit, because we had not received any leading related to this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, releasing the spirit, exercising the spirit, and using the spirit are terms that we invented.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we were still in mainland China, Brother Nee emphasized and frequently used the phrase use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time we did not yet have the phrases exercise your spirit and release your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We did not begin to use these until we were in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we visited people in the past, we knew that we should dress neatly and take our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We knocked on doors in a formal way, and when people answered the door, we were polite and formal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, our formality became stiff and rigid, and as soon as things are rigid, they become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we sat down and our host also sat down, we would look at one another, not knowing what to do or say.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a while we would select a hymn, and after singing the hymn, we prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was a formal ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These were meetings according to the natural human concept of worship and service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is difficult for a person s spirit to be moved in such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, when we researched the Bible, we saw a different situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Acts we saw that the saints sang hymns, praised, and rejoiced spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In chapter 4, when Peter and John were released from jail, they went to the brothers, who immediately rejoiced, praised, and prayed out loud.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After praying, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>23-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What caused the disciples to speak with boldness?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Peter and John were in custody, the Jewish Sanhedrin charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the more the Sanhedrin exhorted and charged, the more the apostles praised.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After praising, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This enabled them to speak even more boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In chapter 5 the apostles were arrested again and reminded of the charge not to teach based upon this name v. 28 . However, Peter and the apostles said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men v. 29 . This shows that the disciples were freed from formality.</S>
