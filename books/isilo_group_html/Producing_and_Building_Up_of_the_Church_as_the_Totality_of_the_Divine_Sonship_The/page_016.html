THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Transformation spontaneously results in the building up of the church. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we desire to come to the meetings. The church is not an organization or a social gathering. The church is an organism built up by the transforming work of Christ. As natural persons, we are clay (Gen. 2:7; 2 Cor. 4:7). We need to be supplied with Christ in order to be transformed into precious stones. By becoming precious stones, we are spontaneously built together (1 Cor. 3:2, 6, 9-12a). As clay we can never be built up, but the more we become precious stones, the more we are built up by growing together (Eph. 2:21). If a finger is broken, the way for it to be built again into the body is to grow together with the hand. This is why the building in the church is so solid. This building is constituted of the believers in Christ not merely placed together but growing together. When we grow together, nothing can divide us. Moreover, Christ is a living stone, and we who come to Him also are living stones (1 Pet. 2:4-5). That the stones are living means that they are growing. This is the way the building is produced. In this building there are the riches of life, the beauty of life, the expression of Christ, and the manifestation of God. This is the proper church life, and this is the preparation of the bride.</p>
<p>Revelation 2:17 says, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone.&rdquo; In this verse there are the hidden manna as the nourishing element and the white stone as the building material. If we eat Jesus as the hidden manna, we will be transformed into white stones for the building. First Peter 2:2-5 expresses the same concept. Verses 2 and 3 say, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; To taste the Lord is to eat, drink, and enjoy Him. This causes us to become living, growing stones to be built up into a spiritual house (v. 5). This house is not a physical building but a building produced by the growth in life. This is the way that the church is built up and the bride is prepared.</p>
<p>We must all have the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is now dwelling in us with all His attainments, accomplishments, and riches. Now we simply need to open to Him by calling on His name, praising Him, and singing to Him. The more we do this, the more we eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him. In this way His element is added to and wrought into our being, causing an organic change, a metabolic transformation. This transformation spontaneously causes us to grow together with others, which is the genuine building up of the church. This is the work of the indwelling Christ revealed in the New Testament. It is by this indwelling work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared. Mere teachings cannot replace this work. This is why we do not care to have regulations and forms. We care only to open ourselves to Christ and receive Him. He is the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive <em>pneuma,</em> the fresh air. When we breathe Him in, we receive His element into us.</p>
<p>Teaching cannot cause people to grow. A mother and a father should not try to teach a newborn baby to grow to be six feet tall. The way of teaching is the way of today&rsquo;s religion. In the church we do not teach people how to behave. We simply nourish people, helping them to eat Christ day by day. In order to eat Christ, we should not only read the Word; we must also eat it. Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). Christianity has made the Bible a book of knowledge, but the Bible must be a book of nourishment to us. We need to eat the word by calling on the Lord and pray-reading. We may pray-read Genesis 1:1, for example, by saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, in the beginning. Oh, in the beginning! In the beginning God created the heavens. Oh, He created the heavens and the earth!&rdquo; By pray-reading in this way, we open ourselves up, and the living Christ adds more of Himself into us. To pray-read in the morning is to have a good &ldquo;breakfast.&rdquo; Day after day we can eat and drink Jesus, and all day long we can breathe Him into us. This will cause us to be transformed.</p>
<p>We all need to put this into practice. It will change our whole life, concept, and view, because Christ is living, real, and rich. He is the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ&mdash;the &ldquo;processed&rdquo; Christ. Before Christ was incarnated, He was the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; Christ. However, He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now this processed and living Christ, who is seated in the heavens, comes into our being as our nourishment to transform us. His transforming work builds us up together so that we can have the church life and become His bride prepared for His coming back.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
