   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TERMINATION AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that to be in Christ is to be in His death, the death which terminates all negative things: sin, the world, the old creation, the old man, the flesh, the self, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He terminated all these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This all-inclusive termination brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible there is a strong principle that death ushers us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is no death, there can be no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In resurrection Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah, His crucifixion is still effective!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise Him that He has been resurrected and that in resurrection He has become the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now as believers we are in Christ; we have entered into an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some Christian teachers speak of being in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This expression is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can be in Christ, but we cannot be in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord was Jesus in the flesh, no one could be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after He was crucified and resurrected and had become the Spirit, we could be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the Spirit, with the Spirit, through the Spirit, and in the Spirit, we can be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the heavenly, spiritual air, and we are now in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ANOINTED ONE AND THE ANOINTING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word Christ is an anglicized form of the Greek word christos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Greek word is an equivalent to the Hebrew word for Messiah, meaning the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the Lord Jesus to be the Messiah, the Christ, the anointed One, means that God's Spirit was poured upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today our Christ is not only the anointed One, but is also the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He Himself has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection Christ is both the anointed One and, as the anointing Spirit, the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In experience we can know that Christ today is the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose someone is suffering and is deeply sorrowful and depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to his feeling, life is not worth living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then he hears the gospel and learns of God's love for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He hears how the Lord Jesus died for him, has been resurrected, and is waiting for him to receive Him by calling, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he says, "Lord Jesus, I thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He finds that his sorrow has gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within he has the sense of being watered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This watering is the Lord's anointing that results in peace, in rest, and in the sense of being loved by the Lord and being cared for by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the experience of Christ as the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call on the Lord's name, the Person of the Lord comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as a person responds when we call his name, so the Lord Jesus Himself responds when we call His name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's name is Jesus Christ, and His Person is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, it is the Spirit who comes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our concept may be that the Lord is only in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, when we call on Him, we may be surprised that He comes so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, as the Spirit He is already within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our intention may be to say, "Lord Jesus Christ, You are in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But before we have finished saying the Lord's name, He has already responded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord can respond so quickly to our calling on Him because in resurrection He is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Genesis 1 we have God, and in the four Gospels we have a record of the life of Jesus on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But today for our experience we have the Lord Jesus Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The moment we begin to call on His name, He comes to us from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is Christ in resurrection.</S>
