<p>At the end of the Psalm God rebukes His enemies from His temple (vv. 29, 30). In verses 21, 22, and 23, God says that He will smite the head of the enemies and bring them again from the depth of the Red Sea that we may dip our feet in their blood. Not only may we share this victory, but even our dogs may partake of it. O what a victory! Today in the church He has already won the victory. We must enjoy it. If we don&rsquo;t believe He has defeated the Egyptian army and buried them in the depths of the sea, He will bring them again to us and let us crush them to demonstrate His victory. This is poetry for our experience and praise.</p>
<p>Oh, may the Lord revolutionize our praises! May He give our praises the content of such a Psalm as this&mdash;praises for such a glorious victory and praises for such a glorious Christ in all His Person and accomplishments. Then we will have a proper meeting.</p>
