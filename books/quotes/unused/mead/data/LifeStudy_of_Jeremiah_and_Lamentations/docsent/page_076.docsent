   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 17 depicts Jeremiah's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of his suffering and disappointment, he said to his mother, "Woe is me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was silent, but Jehovah talked with Jeremiah to encourage and strengthen him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot tell from Jeremiah's answer whether he accepted or rejected God's encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that God spoke in one way according to His feeling and that Jeremiah responded in a different way according to his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jeremiah seemed to be saying to Jehovah, "I am not happy, and I am not rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am suffering, and I am full of indignation because Your hand is upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 18 continues, "Why is my pain unceasing, / And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>/ Will You indeed be to me like a deceitful brook?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ Like waters that fail?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Hebrew word for fail literally means "are not sure."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jeremiah had been hurt, wounded, and he made his complaint to God, asking Him if He would be like a deceitful brook or like waters that fail.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 19 through 21 we have Jehovah's response to Jeremiah's complaint.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His response He gave Jeremiah a further commission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 19 says, "Therefore thus says Jehovah, / If you return, I will restore you; / You will stand before Me; / And if you bring out the precious from the worthless, / You will be as My mouth; / They will turn to you, / But you will not turn to them."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The pronoun you here may be a further indication that God considered Jeremiah as being one with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely Israel needed to return to God and be restored by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may also say that Jeremiah, who was quite disappointed, also needed to return to God in order to be restored by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God told Jeremiah that if he returned to Him, he would be restored and would stand before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God went on to tell Jeremiah that if he brought out, that is, uttered, the precious things from the worthless, he would be as His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jehovah's word concerning uttering precious things may indicate that He regarded Jeremiah's speaking in the previous verses as worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God might have been saying, "Jeremiah, what you have just said is not precious it is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot be My mouth if you speak worthless things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You need to bring out the precious things from the worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do this, you will be My mouthpiece, My prophet, to speak for Me and to speak forth My word."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God continued by telling Jeremiah that if he would be as His mouth, the people of Israel would turn to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, he was not to turn to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 20 Jehovah told Jeremiah that to the people of Israel He would make him a fortified wall of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They would fight against him, but they would not prevail against him, for Jehovah would be with him to save him and deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also promised that He would deliver Jeremiah from the hand of the wicked and redeem him from the grasp of those who terrorize v. 21 .</S>
