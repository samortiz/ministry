You are the Lord who is with us and the One who speaks to us. This morning reveal Yourself to us through Your word. Speak to each one of us, and touch the spirit of every one of us that everyone would feel Your presence in the Spirit and would feel deeply that You are near us and are being gracious to us. Lord, open up Your word. Shine forth the light from Your word and enlighten us. Vindicate that You are one spirit with us and that we are one spirit with You. May our spirit be joined to Your Spirit, and may Your Spirit be mingled with our spirit. Lord, send down Your blessing and pour it out upon everyone who is here in this meeting. Cover us also with Your victorious blood. Oppose the power of darkness for us. Bind Your enemy who is also our enemy. By Your victorious name we pray. Amen.<p>We have seen that in eternity past, before the creation of all things, God had an eternal economy which is simply to dispense the Triune God Himself into the tripartite man. On God&#8217;s side, He is triune, with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. On man&#8217;s side, we are tripartite, with a spirit, a soul, and a body. The God who lives in unapproachable light is the Father; He is the source. When He is manifested, He is the Son. When He visits us, cares for us, and comes upon us, He is the Spirit. This Spirit enters into our spirit to be mingled with our spirit. In this way the two spirits become one spirit. Hence, the spirit is the highest part of man. If you live in the spirit, you are the most uplifted person, one of the highest class. If you live in the soul, you are much lower; you are of the second class. If you live in the body, you are the lowest of all; you are of the third class. For this reason, do not remain in the soul or the body. Rather, you should strive to get into the spirit to touch the Spirit of God and to be mingled with Him.<p>When the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-enters into the spirit, the soul, and the body, man becomes one with God. This is what God in His economy has purposed to accomplish. This matter is recorded in the Bible in a plain and clear way. Unfortunately, when most people read the Bible, they see only the stories on the surface; they do not see the revelation in its depths. They see only that Adam ate of the forbidden fruit and committed a mortal sin, that Abel offered a sacrifice acceptable to God, that Enosh called on the name of Jehovah, etc. They do not see much significance in these things. Actually, all these things are recorded in the Bible as types. They are there to show us how God accomplishes His economy. When Adam sinned and fell, he hid himself and dared not see God&#8217;s face. God came to seek him out and covered him with coats of skin from the sacrifice. Surely he must have been full of gratitude to God, and God&#8217;s Spirit surely must have entered into him then. The issue was Abel. Abel offered sacrifices to God, thereby having a further contact with God, resulting in God&#8217;s Spirit entering into him. Then we come to Enosh who called on the name of Jehovah in his weakness, and the Spirit of God again entered into him. Following that, Enoch walked with God. It must have been due to God&#8217;s working Himself into Enoch and joining Himself to his spirit that he was able to walk with God. After Enoch there was Noah. Not only did Noah walk with God, but he also worked together with God to build the ark. This also must have been done through God&#8217;s Spirit contacting and fellowshipping with man&#8217;s spirit.<p>This matter is proved by Genesis 6:3. There it says that the Spirit of Jehovah would no longer abide in man forever, for he had become flesh (see margin ASV). We see from this that from Genesis 1 to Genesis 5, from Adam to Noah, the Spirit of Jehovah was abiding with man. It was due to the fact that the Spirit of Jehovah was abiding in him that the fallen and sinful Adam was able to obtain God&#8217;s redemption. In the same way, it was due to the fact that the Spirit of Jehovah was with Abel that he offered sacrifice to God. That Enosh would call on the name of Jehovah, that Enoch would walk with God, and that Noah would work with God were all due to the fact that the Spirit of Jehovah was with them.<p>Today when we call &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; it is also due to the fact that the Holy Spirit is with us. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &#8220;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; When we call on the Lord Jesus, it proves that the Holy Spirit is with us. The presence of the Holy Spirit is the coming of the Triune God into us. First, He enters into our spirit. Then He spreads to our soul, uplifting and transforming it. Finally, He will uplift our body, transfiguring it into a glorious body like His own. Hence, God&#8217;s coming to save us is a gradual descent, working Himself into us to effect in us a gradual ascent. First He enters into our spirit, then He uplifts our soul, and then He uplifts our body that we may become the same as He is. Before we were saved, all day long our thoughts, desires, and decisions were on low and dishonorable things. After we are saved, the Spirit of God enters into us to uplift our soul. Now the things we think, desire, and decide in our heart are much higher than before. Moreover, they are daily being uplifted higher and higher. Not only is our soul uplifted; even the functions of our body are uplifted. Before we were saved, our mouth frequently spoke evil words, and our feet walked the way of corruption. Now our mouth speaks words of praise, words of the gospel, and words that build others up. Our feet are now walking to the place of the church meeting. Today we are no longer the fallen Adam; we are Noah. We have been uplifted by the Triune God. We are all high-class people. On the one hand, we offer sacrifices to God and call on His name. On the other hand, we walk with God and work with God. This is what God has planned and intended. It is what He wants to obtain in His economy.<p>This is not all. When we go on further, we will realize that all that we pass through is the experience of the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit. In our experience, there is a part which is what Abraham experienced. There is also a part which is what Isaac experienced, and there is a part which is what Jacob experienced. Jacob was a supplanter. Even while he was in his mother&#8217;s womb, he took hold of his brother Esau&#8217;s heel (Gen. 25:26). When he grew up, he cheated to take Esau&#8217;s blessing from his father (27:23). After he escaped to the house of Laban his uncle, he still used deceiving means to turn the flock into his own (30:42). But he could not escape the transforming hand of God. In the end, the transforming work of the Holy Spirit totally transformed him. When he was old and mature in life, not only did he no longer deceive others, but his supplanting hands were turned into blessing hands, blessing people everywhere. When he went to Egypt and saw Pharaoh, he blessed Pharaoh (47:10). He also blessed the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh (48:9). Before he died, he gave a separate blessing to each of his twelve sons (49:28). The supplanting Jacob became Israel, the prince of God. Joseph came out of Jacob. He represented the reigning aspect of Jacob. He was commissioned by Pharaoh to rule over the whole land of Egypt (41:43). At the time when famine was over the whole world, he distributed the rich food to all the people. All these are works in God&#8217;s economy.<p>Hence, the experiences of all these nine persons in Genesis are part of God&#8217;s economy. God worked Himself into every one of them and worked every one of them into Him. They were joined and mingled with God and were transformed, even to become the prince of God, reigning for God on earth and distributing to others His riches. This experience was high enough. But it was only on the individual side. God had not yet obtained a corporate dwelling place. He still did not have a place on earth in which to dwell.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
