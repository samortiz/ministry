Some brothers and sisters went early that day across the harbor to wait for me at the pier. Had they not waited for me, I would have been in trouble, because I had a great deal of luggage and could not speak the local dialect. After I disembarked from the boat, all my belongings had to be inspected by the Customs Department. Thank the Lord for His grace. He has borne our burden. He has not only preserved us in peace on our journey but also granted us the rich enjoyment of the care and love of the brothers and sisters. This was the case in Wuhan, Canton, and Hong Kong. I witnessed the grace and love of the Lord. His love extends beyond all boundaries. This love is sweet and rich and something that the world can never know. Only the saved sinners can speak of its worth. Hallelujah! Thank and praise His holy name!</p><p>The work here has been much blessed by the Lord. Since the war started in Shanghai, many brothers and sisters have moved here temporarily from other places. Brother and Mrs. Chou En-kai, Brother Wang Dah-ho, and Mr. and Mrs. Chung Wen-jao are all here. There are also many brothers and sisters from Swatow and Amoy here. Thank the Lord that all those who have come have been protected by the Father and are safe. Yesterday I went with Mr. Nee Hwai-zhu to Macao to look for houses. I returned to Hong Kong from Macao that same day. I intend to send all the brothers and sisters to Macao who have come to the south for refuge. The cost of living in Macao is lower than in Hong Kong, and the rent is cheaper. The place is also quite safe. The house that we saw was at 12 Dong-Wang-Yang Street. It is a two-story house and the monthly rent is forty dollars. If this house were in Hong Kong, it would cost at least eighty to ninety dollars.</p><p>Macao really needs the gospel. While I was in Macao, I was deeply disturbed by the superstition and gambling going on everywhere. The prevalence of such activity has not been seen or heard of anywhere in China. Wherever one goes in Macao, he can see people burning incense and papers and worshipping demons. There are gambling houses at every corner. This is truly heartbreaking! I have heard that there are only two gospel missions in Macao, and that it is very difficult to have any evangelizing work. The power of the X religion is very strong and pervasive here, and it limits all other religious activities. I hope that the Lord will quickly send brothers and sisters to labor here. Please pray for this. Presently, Brother Joh-tze and Mrs. Ma Mu are living here. They are all fine. Praise His name. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan<br />December 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Report on the Bible Study in Hankow</h2><p>There were only a few co-workers in Hankow this time. From November 22 to 28 there was a Bible study. Mr. Watchman Nee was responsible for the speaking. Sometimes he spoke twice a day. The subject was "Rethinking Our Work." There were eight messages: (1) God's Workers, (2) The Sending Out of the Apostles and Their Footsteps, (3) The Elders Appointed by the Apostles, (4) The Churches Established by the Apostles, (5) The Basis of Division and Unity, (6) Among the Workers, (7) The Workers and Finance, and (8) The Biblical View concerning Three Important Issues. (These are only the preliminary chapter headings. The book has not been fully polished, and there may be further changes to the chapter headings.) Although we have the notes, they are not complete. Mr. Nee is busily editing and polishing them and intends to publish them as a book. Although the content of this Bible study is similar to the one we had in Shanghai, as far as I know, the light that was released was clearer and the scope was more complete. We hope that through the prayers of many, this book can be published soon and that the co-workers can receive help from it. At times like these, we moan the passing away of those who have gone before us on the one hand and fear that we cannot catch up with what lies ahead of us on the other hand. May God be merciful to us, to the church, and to sinners so that we may redeem the time to follow the apostles' pathway. This may not make up for our lack of the past, but it may at least set our heart somewhat at peace.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Chungking<br />December 28</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
