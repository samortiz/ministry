<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEHOVAH'S WORD OF SHEPHERDING<br>TO HIS SERVANT ISRAEL</H2><P>Chapter forty-four of Isaiah is Jehovah's word of shepherding to His servant Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Pouring Water upon the Thirsty One<br>and Streams upon the Dry Ground</H2><P>Verses 1 through 4 are a word concerning Israel's restoration. Jehovah, the One who formed Israel from the womb, tells Israel not to fear. Then He goes on to say, "I will pour water upon the thirsty one,/And streams upon the dry ground;/I will pour out My Spirit upon your seed [Acts 2:17a], /And My blessing upon your offspring./They will spring up among the grass,/Like poplars beside the flowing streams of water" (Isa. 44:3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Israel Being a Witness<br>That Besides Jehovah There Is No God</H2><P>Jehovah, the King of Israel and her Redeemer, is the First and the Last, and apart from Him there is no God (v. 6). Israel is a witness that Jehovah is the unique God. Concerning this, verse 8b says, "You are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me?/Or is there any other Rock? I do not know of any." All those who make idols are a waste, and the things they delight in will not profit them (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Redeeming Jacob<br>and Being Glorified in Israel</H2><P>Jehovah has formed Israel, His servant, and Israel will not be forgotten by Him (v. 21). He has wiped away, like a thick cloud, Israel's transgression and, like a cloud, their sins. Thus, Jehovah says, "Return unto Me, for I have redeemed you./Sing for joy, O heavens, for Jehovah has accomplished it./Shout, O lower parts of the earth;/Break forth with singing, O mountains,/The forest and every tree in it;/For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob/And has been glorified in Israel" (vv. 22-23).</P>
