   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SIX GOD'S RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION 3 PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the creation of the human life, the higher life with the highest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the last message was a parenthesis, we now continue our study with the process of God's restoration and further creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>13 The Conference of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:26 reveals that there was a conference held by the Godhead and among the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We say "among" because God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Using human terms, we may say that there are three Persons in the Godhead, one God with three Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can't explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can only say that God is triune, that we have one God with three Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was a conference held by these three Persons of the Godhead, and a decision was made.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This conference with its decision initiated the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After God had created the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things on the first part of the sixth day, He did not proceed immediately to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, He had a conference to discuss this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read this verse carefully, we can see that there was something like a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God said, "Let us..."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is one: yet, the pronoun is "us."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It does not say, "Let me make..."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Bible had said "me" and not "us," there would have been no need to say "let."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The phrase "Let us make" means let us have some fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although you may think that I infer too much, we nevertheless have this word in the Bible: "Let us..."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After God created all the foregoing items of life, God still needed to create man as the highest created life to express Himself in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To accomplish this work, there is the need of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is fully proven by the following books of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Up to this point, we have seen eight items of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't forget this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created the grass, the herbs, and the trees at the end of the third day, before the fourth-day lights.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the fourth-day lights, He created the fish and the birds on the fifth day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the early part of the sixth day, God created the cattle, represented by the ox, the beasts, represented by the lion, and the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, there were three items of the plant life and five items of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may seem to us that the whole earth was filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there was not the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The maturity of life on this earth is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even today, after six thousand years, no life on this earth can surpass the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Don't look down on yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are very high, higher than the grass, higher than the herbs and the trees, higher than the cattle, the beasts, and the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are the highest created life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without man, there would have been no maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the Triune God held a conference and initiated the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God decided to create the highest created life.</S>
