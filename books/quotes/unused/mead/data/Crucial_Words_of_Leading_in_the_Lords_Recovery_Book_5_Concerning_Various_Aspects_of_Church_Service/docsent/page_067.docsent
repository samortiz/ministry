   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Practice of the Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Way to Live the Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are currently about three hundred sixty small groups in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every small group should bring in one new one every week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then there will be three hundred sixty new ones every week, and there will be close to one thousand five hundred new ones in four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The primary task of the small groups is to bring in new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second task is to care for those who have not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Taipei there are over twelve thousand saints who can be located by their name and address, but only four to five thousand are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to take care of the seven to eight thousand saints who do not come to the meetings regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This burden should not fall only on the elders; instead, each member in the small groups should pick up the burden to care for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every local church should know which saints have not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The small groups should go and recover these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third task of the small groups is to uphold the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There should only be about twelve people in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then if someone is absent from the meeting, it will be noticed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The saints in the group should go and visit him or her to express their concern and mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The warmth of the brothers and sisters is able to uphold the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A small group has many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It meets the needs of the young and the old, and it causes every saint to spontaneously exercise his function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The small group can be likened to a basketball court in which everyone has an opportunity to play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is room for everyone to either dribble the ball or to shoot baskets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to see that the small groups are the way to practice living the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, to practice the Body life, we also need to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For many years we have paid much attention to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, we neglected preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Taiwan is now economically prosperous, and people do not lack food or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s recovery has been on this island for thirty-six years, but the gospel has not yet been preached throughout the land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of the small villages surrounding Taichung still do not have a church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the past two hundred years, the Western missionaries that were sent from Europe and America preached the gospel throughout Africa and Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time transportation was extremely inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It took six months for a Western missionary to travel to China by boat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though transportation and communication methods have greatly advanced, we have not spread the gospel to all of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to confess our shortage before the Lord and produce many more full-timers so that the gospel can be preached widely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the tribe of Levi should be considered as full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rest of the eleven tribes were responsible for the livelihood of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament there were one hundred twenty people when the church was established.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These believers supported the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the New Testament nine persons supporting one full-timer is more advanced than eleven supporting one in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to church history, there was a group that practiced every nineteen saints supporting one full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the practice of this group, at least one in every twenty saints was sent overseas to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past it was expensive for Europe or America to send missionaries overseas, yet they had the spirit to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose we follow their pattern and send out one full-timer for every twenty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then Taichung, which has a regular attendance of seven hundred saints, should support thirty-five full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The number of full-timers in Taichung, however, is far below this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that we owe the Lord many full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I speak this word to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should all agree with this word whether we are young or old.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should have the feeling that we owe the Lord taxes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord does not want only our money; He wants men, full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without full-timers we will not be able to reach the goal of evangelizing Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we first arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the crime rate was not as high as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many serious crimes are reported daily in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These crimes are the issue of Taiwan being short of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whose responsibility is this?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are over ten thousand saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we can produce one full-timer out of every twenty saints, there would be five hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we sent three full-timers to one place, they would cover at least one hundred sixty-five places, and by the end of this year there would be churches in one hundred sixty-five new places.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not having the small group meetings is a great damage to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Similarly, if there are no full-timers produced among us, it will also be a great damage.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thirty years ago there were not so many temples on the island of Taiwan, but now there are huge temples everywhere, and many people go there to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This indicates that there is a shortage of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>USING OUR MONEY TO EARN SINNERS SOULS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In practicing the Body life we also need to take care of material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A single full-timer, for example, needs to eat, live, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He will need at least ten thousand Taiwan dollars per month as support note: approximately 330 U.S. dollars .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I last visited Taichung, I appreciated the big meeting hall, but I also lamented the fact that we spent too much money to build it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should have saved some for the support of full-timers to go out and spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not spend all our money on buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In God s eyes only people s souls are precious.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to use our money to support full-timers to go out and spend it on the Lord s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hymns, #1068, stanza 1 says, While angels in His presence sang / Until the courts of heaven rang.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This hymn says that whenever we bring one person to repentance, the angels in heaven will sing and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The angels might be saying, If you do not preach the gospel, we have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are all preaching the gospel, and someone is saved in Taichung, in Nantou, and in Fong-yuan, the angels will be very busy, singing and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, please remember Paul s word: I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent 2 Cor 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul spent his money, his energy, and even himself for the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Not only did he spend money and energy, but he also spent his person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I hope that the young brothers and sisters would have such a heart and are willing to spend their lives for the sake of people s souls.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They still have many days ahead of them, so they should have a firm resolution of heart to give their lives to the Lord for His move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It may not be suitable for the working saints and the older saints to serve full time due to their age and circumstances, but they should nevertheless spend their money on the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then the church where we are will be able to declare, We spend money, energy, and even ourselves for sinners souls.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>THREE ASPECTS OF THE SAINTS FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I hope that we all have a clear view of today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>First, we need to promote the small groups by encouraging the saints to function so that the Body of Christ may be expressed practically on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Second, we need to have thousands of young brothers and sisters who will give themselves to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These ones should go to the towns and villages all over the island to evangelize and truthize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This should be the glorious goal of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I hope that many young brothers and sisters will give themselves to this cause and share in this glory, and the rest of the saints should match them with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Third, we should give financially to match this move and make friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All of us should function in these three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should function in the meeting, we should function by giving our bodies to serve full time, and we should function by giving money.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the way for us to live the practical Body life in the Lord s recovery.</S>
