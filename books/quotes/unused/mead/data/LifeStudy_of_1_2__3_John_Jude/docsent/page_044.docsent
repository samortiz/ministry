   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE FOURTEEN CONDITIONS OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP 6 Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider 2:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 1 John says, My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that here John tells his little children, all the recipients of this Epistle, that his intention in writing was that they would not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if anyone sins, we have an Advocate, a helper or counsel, with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 2 John goes on to say that Christ is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have pointed out, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins, not only for our redemption but also for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His vicarious death satisfied God and appeased Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, He is the propitiation between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the propitiation concerning man s sins, the Lord Jesus is for the sins of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, this propitiation is conditional upon our receiving it by believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BLOOD OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND THE ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John s writing in this Epistle is tender and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I first read chapter one years ago, I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I did not understand why John added 2:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seemed to me that the problem of sin had been fully solved in chapter one, and I thought that these verses in chapter two were not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later I came to appreciate the importance of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to chapter one of this Epistle, we have received the divine life, and we are enjoying it in the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this fellowship we receive the divine light, and in this light we practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we still need the warning concerning the sin that dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be careful and on the alert regarding indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we sin, we need to confess our sin to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we confess our sins, God is faithful in His word to forgive us our sins, and He is righteous in His redemption to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, as 2:1-2 indicates, we still need a Person, an Advocate with the Father, to take care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we are not capable of handling the case ourselves, we need a heavenly attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter one John speaks of the blood of Jesus, and in chapter two, of our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only has God provided the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us so that we may be forgiven and cleansed; God has also prepared Christ as our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, the Lord Jesus shed His blood as the price of our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then after shedding His blood, He becomes our Advocate, our heavenly attorney, taking care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How marvelous that our Advocate pays our debt and takes care of our case!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father, and not simply with God, indicates that our case which the Lord undertakes for us is a family affair, a case between us as the Father s children and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, our Advocate is our elder Brother, the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine family is full of love, but it is also full of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, there are regulations and also the Father s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never think that in the Father s house we can be unruly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our Father is orderly, and His house should be much more orderly than a human court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, as children in the Father s house, we are often naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We make mistakes, break the family regulations, and offend the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, we need the Lord, our elder Brother, to be our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the One who shed His blood for us, the Lord Jesus is the righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is right not only with the Father, but also right with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is our Paraclete the anglicized form of parakletos, the Greek word rendered Advocate .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He comes alongside to help us, He serves us, He takes care of us, and He provides whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were in need of the cleansing blood; therefore, He provided us with His own blood for redemption and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also need someone to take care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, He is now our Advocate, our parakletos.</S>
