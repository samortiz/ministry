   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FAITH THAT SAVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will not explain this verse now even though I feel it would help you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me first tell you what it means to "believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose there is a sinner and you preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You tell him that he is a sinner and that Jesus Christ has accomplished the work of redemption for him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then you try to find out whether he has believed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He tells you that he wants to believe, that he wants the Lord to forgive his sins, and that he wants to come to God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After you hear this, you may feel that your word has produced some result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may be very delighted and ask him to pray for forgiveness of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He may then pray, "O God, please forgive my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am a sinner and I deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank You that You sent the Lord to die for me and shed His blood for me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please forgive my sins through the Lord Jesus so that I can be a saved person."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How would you feel about this kind of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it not a very good prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sinner who can pray like this should be qualified for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is indeed a model prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this cannot be farther from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is really saying that he believes that God will save him and that God will forgive his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How terrible this is!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By saying that God will do this and God will do that, he is, in effect, pouring cold water all over you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says, "I fully believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that God will save me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that He will forgive my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you think this person is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone knows that such a person is not saved, and none of his sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He only believes that he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He thinks that he fully believes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, he does not have any faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is saying, after one prays, "Thank God, my sins have all been forgiven by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank God, I am already saved!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps he will say this with tears in his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not believing that we will have something or we can have something, but that we already have it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not believing that our sins can be forgiven or will be forgiven, but believing that our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the only faith spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith is not believing that we can have something or will have something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Real faith is believing that we already have it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not that we will have it, but that we already have it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people are clear at the time of their salvation what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They believe that they are already saved, not that they will be saved or forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when they hear the next step of the truth, they give up the faith that they had before.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the time they are saved, they believe that they have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when it comes to the next step of the truth, they can only believe that they will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Friends, we have learned one lesson of faith already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every saved person has learned one lesson of faith they believe that they are already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But after they are saved, they have no faith concerning Christ's work in the other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>FREEDOM FROM SIN THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us now turn to the matter of deliverance from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Six years ago, a person attended our meetings in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was a board member of an independent church, and he was from a wealthy family.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ninety percent of the pastor's salary came from him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was an important person in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He not only donated a great deal of money, but he was also very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He often attended our Bible study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One morning he came to my home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I had no sooner asked him how he was when I saw tears rolling from his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I asked him what was bothering him, and he said, "Mr. Nee, you do not know me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You think I am a zealous person and that I love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You do not know what kind of person I really am.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although I am zealous and love the Lord, I have a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have a terrible temper.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It only takes a very small thing to make me so angry that I smash anything that is in my way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Afterward, I realize that this was not proper Christian behavior, and I ask God to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But after I pray, I still get angry and smash things when my employees do something wrong again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I act the same way toward my family.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am a Christian, but I do not look like one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although I confess my sins, I still lose my temper after my confession.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"I tell my employees that they have to work' on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What I mean by working' on the Lord's Day is attending church services.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But since I lose my temper at least once or twice a day, they do not believe in the Lord even though I have pleaded with them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I preach to them, they talk behind my back, saying, He says he believes in God and that he is a Christian, but he is no better than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why should we believe?'</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I hear this, I am very saddened.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If they perish in the future it will be because of me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I pray to God to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have even resolved to not lose my temper anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But this has not worked.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My temper is getting worse.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Last night the whole neighborhood could hear me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A very minor thing provoked me to throw around everything in the shop; even the glasses were broken.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My financial loss is not that important.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The most difficult thing for me to bear was when my employees said, How can a Christian behave in such a terrible way?'</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"I know my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I cannot sleep all night.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I do not want to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why does it keep coming back?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Today is the Lord's Day, and it is my turn to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I told myself that I have to behave today and not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If I lose my temper, I will not be able to give my message.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But in the morning my wife gave me a bowl of hot soup.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>She could stand the heat of the soup, but I could not.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I was so angry that I threw the bowl at her and had a big argument with her.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is no way I can give a message today.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>"I am a Christian, but my temper is like the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I really do not know what to do!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is why I came to you today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Mr. Nee, please think of a way to help me! No matter what it takes, you have to help me to get rid of this temper." He was very sad as he spoke, but as I was listening, I kept on laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He said, "Mr. Nee, you have to help me." He was crying as he was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But the more he cried, the more I laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He said, "Mr. Nee, I am really miserable!" I said, "You are miserable, but I am very happy." He said, "I really do not know what to do." I said, "Nothing could be better." He said, "Mr. Nee, do not make fun of me." I said, "I am very happy because this is a sickness which only the Lord can heal.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some people can heal themselves, and some people can only be healed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord can heal your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He will surely heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although you feel that you have a terrible temper, the Lord is mightier than your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>A temper such as yours can be healed by the Lord in an instant."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He said, "It is not so simple!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You have never seen my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If you had seen it, you would know that it is not so easy."</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I said, "It would not matter even if it were ten times worse.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord is able to heal it."</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I told him to read Romans 8:2 and then asked him, "What does God's Word say?"</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He said, "God says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I asked, "Where does the Spirit free you from the law of sin and of death?"</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He said, "In Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I asked, "Are you in Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He said, "Although I am bad, I must admit that I am still in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I said, "What does the Bible say if you are in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The Bible says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>What kind of sins is He freeing you from?</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>From your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The Spirit has freed you in Christ from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Why are you still not freed?"</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He said, "It is my hope that God will free me today."</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I then asked, "Does the Bible say that the Spirit will free you?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>No, God says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>What does the word "has" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>None of us say that we have taken our meal tomorrow; we only say that we have already taken our meals.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The word "has" means that something is accomplished, that the things mentioned are accomplished facts."</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>I went on and said, "The Bible says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Are you freed from your sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>He said, "No, I am not."</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I said, "If you have not been freed, does that mean God's Word is not true?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>God says that in Christ you have been freed.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Yet you say that you have not been freed.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Is God's Word reliable or is your word reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Are you saying that God is a liar?"</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>He said that he would never consider God's Word to be lies, and that he believed in all the Scriptures, but that honestly he had not been freed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>I pointed at him and said, "God is not afraid of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Even if your temper were ten times worse, God would not be afraid of it.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But all the sins you have committed in all these years are not as serious as the one you have committed this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>This morning you have committed the biggest sin the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>No other sin is worse than the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>You have an evil heart of unbelief within.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>You must ask God to remove this evil heart of unbelief so that you can believe."</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Next I said, "I have to prepare myself because I have to give a message this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>You should ask God to forgive your sin and to remove your evil heart of unbelief so that you can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>I am going upstairs and will leave you in the sitting room.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>You should pray to the Lord here and ask Him to deliver you so that you can believe."</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Then I went upstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>After half an hour, I came down and asked how he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>He said, "Mr. Nee, everything is fine! I am fully freed, and I am truly freed.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Thank God!"</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Then he went home.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Brothers and sisters, the faith this person had was a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>No one could deal with his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>But on that morning when he believed, his temper was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>I did not see him for nearly two months after that.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>One day I met him on the tram.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>I asked him how things were going.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>He said, "Thank God, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>After six months, I saw him again and asked him how things were going.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>He said again, "Thank God, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>It is not believing that God will work but that God has already worked.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>It is believing that we already have it.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>The phrase has already worked implies a fact that has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Never change has already worked to will work.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>All we have to do is to thank God that He has freed all of us in Christ.</S>
