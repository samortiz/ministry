   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Worker Not Being Bound</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by One Locality or One Assembly</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They worked in Iconium and started another assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 14:4 indicates that the multitude of the city was divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some followed the Jews, and some followed the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that the number was quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says that the apostles fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the "surrounding" region because some were trying to treat them outrageously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the Bible, the Lord has no intention for a worker to go to a place and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A worker should be above any locality or any assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An apostle is for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Lystra Paul healed a lame man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 20 says that the disciples "sur- rounded" Paul, and verse 21 tells us that there was a "considerable number of disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that there were many disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Paul was wounded, he rested only for a night and went to Derbe the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not go to Derbe to recuperate from his wound, but to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul and Barnabas passed through all these places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once a number of people were saved, they moved on to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not stay in a church to "edify" men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul kept moving forward to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he went through all the places, then he returned to build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They went forward first to establish the churches, and then returned later to strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 14:23 says that the two appointed elders in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They appointed elders in "every" church; there was no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would think that an assembly needs ten or twenty years before some saints mature and are old enough to be appointed as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the apostles handed over the responsibility of the assembly to the local brothers very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The workers are responsible for the extra-local work of the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The local responsibility must be taken up by the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONCERNING THE ELDERS The Appointment of the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible gives us very brief qualifications of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a worker goes to a place, he cannot appoint elders immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he returns from another place and sees that a group of saints are still meeting, he can be assured that they are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From among them, he will spontaneously find some who are particularly seeking spiritually and appoint them as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WORKS OF AN ELDER</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>An elder does not monopolize everything in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The works of the elders are: 1 managing the administrative affairs of the church, taking the lead in receiving the saints, making arrangements for the meetings, and collecting offerings; and 2 caring for the local believers, preaching regularly to the congregation, and nurturing the brothers and sisters spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Administration and preaching are the main responsibilities of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to 1 Timothy 5:17 there are two kinds of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One kind takes the lead in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other kind not only takes the lead in the church, but labors in the word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The regular preaching and shepherding work in a local church belongs to the elders; they are not the work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Titus 1:9 says that the elders have to hold to the faithful word and to exhort and convict by the healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows us that an elder must not only bear administrative responsibility, but must bear spiritual responsibility as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the workers do not bear any responsibility for a local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, the preaching on the Lord's Day, Wednesday, and Saturday should be the common responsibility of the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church in Shanghai does not have any worker.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Someone in the church in Swatow has said that a church cannot be without a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul and Barnabas established over ten churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they presided over a church, how could they have been distributed among all these churches?</S>
