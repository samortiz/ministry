   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EFFECT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a man has not believed in Christ, nothing will happen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But once he believes, everything in Christ will come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if he does not feel different, in reality he is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some say that this is the effect of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not the effect of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the effect of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in Kaifeng, I met the chief of a department in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Formerly, he was a mere consenter of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This time, he believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told me, "I used to think that there was not much difference between believing and agreeing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But a recent incident showed me that I am not the same person I used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have been given charge of a clubhouse with a tennis court to which high government officials regularly attend.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not infrequent for these people to leave sums of money in the club for the furnishing of tennis equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently, due to an order from the government, many officers were transferred.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They left quite a bit of money and belongings in the club.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Since they have left and no one knows where they are, the money and belongings naturally would become my possession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They will never come back for them, and no one will ever quibble about them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But somehow I felt that I could not claim those items.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had to take the trouble of looking up each one of their addresses and sending the items back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of thing would never have happened to me before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am definitely changed."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>POWER IN FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A man who has met Christ in faith is different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only those who have touched Christ have His power manifested through them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the filthy and binding sins are shaken off from us when we touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The minute we believe in Him, His resurrection life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By faith all these become real in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only are our lives changed by faith, but there is a very great power within this faith which motivates thousands to become missionaries and martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This great power within is irrepressible and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It makes man willing to suffer for the Lord, ride through danger, and eventually be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these abilities come from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we touch Christ, everything of Him will be transmitted into us.</S>
