   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Teaching of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a child of God thinks that something is the prompting of the Holy Spirit, for the sake of safety, he should verify what he is about to do with the biblical teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Biblical teaching does not refer to isolated verses in the Bible taken out of their context.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many believers act in a haphazard way; they read one or two verses and consider them to be God's ordained will for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes they pray piously and then open the Bible to read a few verses randomly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they come across a word that fits their circumstances, they consider that as God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will move, stop, go, or turn based on these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they unfortunately find some contrary indications, or if verses they read have nothing to do with their affairs, they think that God has not said anything to them, or they unnaturally interpret the passage to make it fit into their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then they base their decisions on this method.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult to expect a person who does not understand the Bible to be free from error!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What does it mean that a believer has to understand the teaching of the Bible when he does things?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The teaching of the Bible refers to the common testimony of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One should consider how the whole Bible deals with the question at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Indeed, he should consider how it deals with all the problems that he encounters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One has to understand what the Old and New Testaments say about the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has to understand how the question was dealt with in the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, and the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is by this that we know that we do not follow the judgment of the Old Testament, but the judgment of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not follow the decision of the patriarchs or the law, but the instructions of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But is this not a very difficult thing to do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who can know these distinctions unless he is a Bible scholar?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is one reason why we have to search the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible is a record of God's will for the whole world in all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a believer wants to understand God's will, he must study not just read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The words of the Bible are easy to understand because they are revealed to babes Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is God's complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has clear explanations concerning His plan, His ways, His will, and all other kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God gave the Bible to His people with the expectation that they would understand all of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, if believers do not study the Bible and instead just complain that they do not understand God's will, they have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes the matter may be great and difficult, and we cannot find the biblical teaching concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At such times, we should consult spiritually matured believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord can often teach us through these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not overvalue man's words; we should still "discern" 1 Cor 14:29 and decide if they are scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not search the Scriptures and do not consult with spiritual believers, it is very likely that we will fall into error if we only grasp one or two verses and consider them to be God's will and act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The importance of obedience to the word of the Bible can be seen in a contrast between the temptation in the garden of Eden and the temptation in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In those two temptations, one person was defeated while the other overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One factor decided whether or not there was defeat or victory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the former case, there was disobedience to God's word, while in the latter case, there was obedience to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The failure in Eden, which was an insubordination of God's will, became the root of the world's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Lord, on the other hand, overcame the enemy and his temptation three times in the wilderness with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The devil's temptations appeared harmless; in fact they seemed to be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Lord Jesus cautiously abode by the word of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why He overcame completely in the end. Therefore, in our daily life, the most important rule is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If in everything, we seek the teaching of the Scriptures, we will not walk apart from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we sense the prompting of the Holy Spirit, we should ask if the prompting is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should ask if what we consider to be the Holy Spirit's prompting is indeed His prompting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we ask ourselves in this way, we will prove its authenticity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All Scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and the whole Bible reveals God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible for the Holy Spirit to inspire Scriptures in one way and prompt us in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible for God's will to be revealed in the Bible in one way and for the Holy Spirit to prompt us in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This can never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The prompting of the Holy Spirit will never contradict the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible and the Holy Spirit forever walk and work together; they show us the way we ought to take.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are one in revealing God's will to us, and they never disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we say that we have the prompting of the Holy Spirit concerning a certain matter, and yet the matter contradicts the Scriptures, our so-called prompting of the Holy Spirit must be a wrong one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should remember this well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever a prompting does not match the Scriptures, we should be quiet and not proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The best proof of whether or not a prompting is from the Holy Spirit is to see if the prompting contradicts the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes, however, it seems as if the Scriptures do not say yes or no about a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, you may want to go to a certain place to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is scriptural for you to go because the Bible has clear teaching encouraging this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But it can equally justify you not to go, because sometimes the Lord forbade His apostles from preaching in certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At such times, you have to be careful in distinguishing between the prompting of the Holy Spirit and other forces.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there is indeed the leading of the Holy Spirit, you can proceed.</S>
