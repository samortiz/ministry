[1]  I was not a gospel preacher by nature, but due to the Lord s mercy, I was forced out of my old nature to become a crazy preacher of the gospel for the Lord.
[2]  To preach the gospel, you must have a spirit that is so released and strong that if you faced the devil, you would convince even him to receive the gospel.
[3]  In January of 1933, Dr. Sung went to Chefoo to preach the gospel, and I went to listen to him.
[4]  I could not help but shake my head when I listened to his preaching.
[5]  When she came back, she told us that after Dr. Sung had spoken for a while, he suddenly picked up a wooden stick and pointed at a young lady in the audience, saying, You are someone s mistress! The woman was infuriated and said within, How can you Christians behave in this way? You invite people to come to hear the gospel, yet you rebuke them.
[6]  Therefore, I would like to tell you that when you preach the gospel, if you care only about speaking rightly and pleasingly, do not expect to lead people to salvation.
[7]  If we are, then when we come to the meeting, we do not need to shout loudly the moment we pray, others will be able to sense that we are beside ourselves before God.
[8]  If we study world history with spiritual insight, we will see that since the ascension of the Lord Jesus, the entire world history has been completely under the direction of the Lord s gospel.
[9]  It is the gospel that directs the world; it is not the world that directs the gospel.
[10]  By the Lord s mercy, I have studied this matter a great deal.
[11]  Actually, even before the birth of the Lord Jesus, the world situation was working in different ways to coordinate with the gospel.
[12]  From the birth and death of the Lord Jesus we can clearly see how the Roman Empire was used by God to accomplish what He had spoken in the Old Testament concerning the Lord Jesus.
[13]  The subject of the book of Acts is that after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, was enthroned, poured down Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit, and sent His disciples to preach the gospel everywhere for the producing of the churches and for the spreading and propagating of the kingdom of God.
[14]  We are all clear today that the preaching of the gospel has to be matched by a proper environment.
[15]  For the spread of the gospel we need a peaceful situation, a free flow of traffic, and a common language.
[16]  When we come to chapter twenty-one of Acts, we see that there was a great number of Christians gathering again at Jerusalem v. 20 . This is a principle: whenever there is a move of the gospel, the residents of the locality involved will have to make a change; that is, a migration has to take place.
[17]  Similarly, the flow of the gospel brought us from mainland China to Taiwan and then to America.
[18]  To summarize the different situations mentioned above, we cannot carry out the Chinese-speaking work in the same way we did two years ago.
[19]  At that time, I considered that the Chinese-speaking work was transitory in nature and would serve as a bridge for those with a language problem.
[20]  I have spoken this much because I hope that you all can see how much the Lord has done in the world situation for the spread of the gospel.
[21]  Without the Lord s work in the world situation, none of us would have come to America.
[22]  By observing the history of the world, studying the biographies of the saints throughout the ages, and recalling my personal experiences, I saw that wherever the gospel goes, there the Lord s blessing is.
[23]  I truly believe that the reason Taiwan is so prosperous today and has become a miracle in the world is that the churches with the gospel are there, and therefore the Lord s blessing is also there.
[24]  However, due to the Lord s blessing people have become rooted again, so the Lord has to stir up the environment once more to uproot them so that all things would work together for the spread of the gospel.
[25]  Therefore, Paul was able boldly to say to them, And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship....For I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me vv.
[26]  If all of you would work for the Lord s gospel in one accord, the Lord will give all things and all men to His church, and He will add to us day by day those who are saved.
[27]  If when you meet the Lord, you see that everyone else is bringing a herd of lambs and you alone are empty-handed, you will feel sad and ashamed.
[28]  While living on earth, we believers should bear fruit and save souls.
[29]  Then when we meet the Lord or when the Lord comes, we will be able to settle accounts with Him and feel glorious.
[30]  Otherwise, if we did not lead one person to salvation in our lifetime, we will be full of shame on that day and not have a good feeling.
[31]  If you ask the Lord, What do You expect me to reap if You have not sown? the Lord will answer, Do not care whether or not I sow.
[32]  I truly worship the Lord that I have been in His work for more than fifty years.
[33]  Therefore, I said in the previous message that based on my observation, my understanding of history, and my fifty years of study of the world situation and the news, I came to a conclusion: Apparently the gospel has nothing to do with the world situation; actually according to history the world situation is all under the control of the Lord s hand with a view for the spreading of the gospel.
[34]  In six thousand years of human history, no philosophy, doctrine, theory, or any other religion has been so prevailing as the Christian gospel.
[35]  Regardless of how people despise, ignore, and oppose the gospel and even attack and persecute the preachers of the gospel, the gospel continues to spread.
[36]  Many of us can testify that we are not foolish, yet we all heard and believed the gospel and are preaching and speaking Jesus every day.
[37]  We love the Lord, and we also ask the Lord to burn us; this is to be captivated by the Lord.
[38]  When I first began to work for the Lord, I was burning with love for the Lord and for the preaching of the gospel.
[39]  Nevertheless, the Lord did something and sent me here, so I came with the determination that I am here not merely to live an American life but to gather and reap people for the Lord.
[40]  In 1948 I released a message in Shanghai called Coming and Going.
[41]  The Lord said in Matthew 11:28, Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
[42]  Dear brothers and sisters, we do not need to migrate to Suiyuan or Antung.
[43]  If we would just give this matter a little attention and exert a little energy, we will be able to gain many Chinese around us, gathering them into our nets and putting them into our storehouses.
[44]  Now it simply depends on whether or not we will cooperate with the Lord as His good slaves to open our homes to reap and to gather His crops.
[45]  The book of Acts shows us that once a church was established, the saints began to preach the gospel and to meet from house to house.
[46]  Once you open your doors and invite people in, once you open your mouth to release what is within you, the Lord will bless and add some saved ones to the church.
[47]  CHAPTER THREE THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Luke 24:47-49; Acts 1:8, 14; 4:8; 13:9; 6:4, 7; 12:24; 19:20; Rom 1:16 THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL
[48]  In the last two chapters we saw the commission of the gospel.
[49]  In this chapter, we will go on to see the power of the gospel.
[50]  God not only has given us a commission to preach His gospel; He has also given us power to accomplish the commission He has given us.
[51]  The New Testament reveals that the Lord sends us to preach the gospel, as those who go to do business.
[52]  Therefore, the Lord not only has commissioned us with the gospel, charging us to preach it; He has also given us the power that enables us to preach the gospel.
[53]  However, if we do not read carefully, we will not see that within this charge there is a support, which is the power of the Lord.
[54]  Rather, there are clear records telling us that they were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly that is, they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and consequently they consecrated themselves and all they had to the Lord and also prepared themselves to migrate to other countries for the preaching of the gospel.
[55]  Before incarnation, the Triune God did not pass through any processes.
[56]  THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE, AND THE ELECTRUM
[57]  Still, I have to say that if you do not buy it now, you will regret it later, and when you do want to buy it, you will not be able to.
[58]  Our power for the preaching of the gospel depends on our enjoyment of this all-inclusive Spirit.
[59]  We all know that before we preach the gospel, we should pray to contact God and to enjoy Him.
[60]  To pray is to contact God, and to be in the ministry of the word is to release the Lord s gospel to others.
[61]  They do not realize that if they had stayed in their homeland, they would be worshipping idols and would not be able to believe in the Lord by any means, and that because of this, the Lord blew them here to give them this opportunity to receive the Lord.
[62]  I hope that you will make a solemn decision before the Lord today to reconsecrate yourself for the move of His gospel and to consecrate your time to the best of your ability for His gospel.
[63]  Lord, we pray that You would open the door of the gospel so that those whom we have contacted can come to believe in You and to receive You.
[64]  CHAPTER FOUR THE OUTLET FOR THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Luke 5:27-29; Acts 5:42; 10:24 THE STORY OF
[65]  When you hear the gospel and the Holy Spirit starts to work, your inner being is in turmoil as you struggle whether or not to receive the gospel.
[66]  To many in the Pentecostal movement, the power of the gospel is related mostly to speaking in tongues, divine healing, and casting out demons.
[67]  I have studied this book for many years, and it is more and more clear to me that the power of the gospel lies in two items God s Spirit and God s word and it also lies in two matters prayer and the speaking of God s word.
[68]  I simply speak, and you give in. My secret is this: Every time before I release a message, if I do not pray first, I feel incapable and powerless, but once I pray, the fire is ignited in only ten minutes.
[69]  However, if we have not learned to properly study the word of God, we will have no way to speak it.
[70]  In Taiwan I tried to teach the saints to stir up their spirit, but I was not clear about how to do it.
[71]  Later when I came to America, I saw clearly that to stir up the spirit is to call on the name of the Lord.
[72]  In Acts 2 Peter said that when the Holy Spirit is outpoured, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved v. 21 . Normally we understand salvation in a shallow way.
[73]  However, when people asked Peter what they should do, Peter said, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit v. 38 . This indicates that the blessing of salvation begins with the forgiveness of sins and consummates with the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[74]  It is strange that although we have already received the Spirit, if we do not avail ourselves of the Spirit, everything we do will be to no avail.
[75]  In order to have the Spirit, we have to pray, and in our prayer we have to call on the name of the Lord.
[76]  If your home is not given for the Lord s use, and you preach the gospel only individually, then there will be a mouthpiece but no outlet.
[77]  CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO VISIT PEOPLE BY DOOR-KNOCKING Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Acts 4:31; Rom 10:13; Mark 16:16a THE CARRYING OUT OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY
[78]  Starting from October of 1984, the Lord has led us anew to have a change in Taipei.
[79]  We have spent much time and energy to bring in such a change because we saw that even though the truth in the Lord s recovery is rich, bright, and high, the increase in the number of saints among us has been very slow and low.
[80]  In this message I first want to fellowship a result that came out of our experiment: We should go door-knocking and preach the gospel from house to house in the communities and on the college campuses, not to people we are familiar with but by knocking on strange doors.
[81]  It is true that in cooperating with prayer, we should take action and go out to visit by door-knocking.
[82]  If this is the way you look, when you stand there giving a message or sit there to preach the gospel to others, who will listen to you?
[83]  When people see that you do not look like a proper person yet you are trying to preach the gospel to them to get them saved, they may think that you should be saved first before you come and get them saved.
[84]  If you truly love the Lord, desire the truth, pursue the growth in life, frequently confess your sins, receive dealings before the Lord, and are being filled with the Holy Spirit, you will be improved in your character.
[85]  But when you go to knock on doors, if your hair is messy, your tie is crooked and does not match your clothes, and your shoes are not polished, then people may open the door to let you in, and they may ask you to sit down, but the more they observe you, the more they will feel that you are not proper.
[86]  In the same way, no matter how thoroughly you prayed and confessed to the Lord yesterday, you still have to pray thoroughly today before you go out to visit people and bring the Lord to them.
[87]  However, through prayer, confessing of sins, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, not only will you have the boldness when door-knocking, but you will also have the confidence that the person you are visiting will be saved.
[88]  Once you are filled with the Holy Spirit though, not only will you have the power for speaking, but you also can determine whether or not he will be saved.
[89]  When you go door-knocking, you have to pay attention to your attitude.
[90]  The result of our study and experiment this year in Taipei has proven that the new way surely is the God-ordained way.
[91]  First, we discovered that many high-rise and apartment managers are brothers who have not been meeting with us regularly.
[92]  If the manager is not a Christian, once he hears that you have come to preach the gospel, he may have a long face and ask you to leave, not welcoming you or paying attention to you.
[93]  When many of the managers heard that we were preaching the gospel, they immediately welcomed us and said, Thank the Lord, I also am a brother.
[94]  In this message we will continue to fellowship more thoroughly on the matter of baptism, as this is related to our past exercise and practice.
[95]  Not only so, another verse says, For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection v. 5 . This indicates that the saints in Rome also did not know that to be baptized into the Lord s death was to be baptized into the Lord s resurrection.
[96]  However, if you were to ask me at that time whether I was clear about salvation, I definitely would have said that I was not clear, and regarding the truth I was even less clear.
[97]  A full-term child is born after being in the mother s womb for nine months, but doctors also know that a child born after only six and a half months can also live.
[98]  The mistake we make in our practice today is that we neglect people after we baptize them, just as someone may neglect a child after birth.
[99]  Therefore, after a person is baptized, the first thing we must do is to enter into an agreement with him, telling him, From today on we will often visit you at your home, bringing the meeting to you.
[100]  God s Word says that if the gospel is preached to a sinner, and he receives it, repents, confesses, believes in the Lord Jesus, and also prays, then in the eyes of God he is saved.
[101]  After the time we go to someone s home to baptize him, the next time we meet in his home we can begin to teach him to sing.
[102]  If your spirit is filled with the Lord and His word and you can sing and pray, then you are living, and whatever you do will be living.
[103]  THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim 2:2, 15 THE MEANING OF BAPTISM
[104]  In the fresh leading we have received of the Lord, our first step is to learn to visit people by door-knocking.
[105]  The first thing with door-knocking is to talk to people about the Lord, to speak the gospel, to lead them to pray and receive the Lord, and then to baptize them.
[106]  Before a person is baptized, we need to tell him clearly that as we baptize him, we will be immersing him into water, which signifies that we are immersing him into the Lord Gal 3:27 .
[107]  He was formerly outside of the Lord, but now through baptism he becomes one who is in the Lord.
[108]  Hence, through baptism, we put him into the Lord s death, into the Lord, into the Triune God, and into the church, the Body of Christ.
[109]  We have already seen that the Spirit, the Word, singing, and prayer are the four crucial elements of the meetings.
[110]  We have the Spirit and the Word of the Lord, and in the meetings we must exercise to sing and to pray.
[111]  Do not set a time limit and say that you will take care of a new one for only three months; then if he does not come along in three months, you will abandon him.
[112]  A sister, who is a teacher, thought that the principal of the school, who is also a brother, was an amiable person, so she gave him a copy of the Recovery Version and a copy of Truth Lessons.
[113]  He brought them home, but by coincidence, just before he read them, his parents came to visit him.
[114]  Every one of us should live entirely for the Lord s interests on this earth.
[115]  Although you have a job, you are still working for the Lord.
[116]  This way depends on your taking what you have received from your job, aside from amply supplying the needs of your family, and offering it entirely to the Lord to meet the needs of the work and of the full-timers.
