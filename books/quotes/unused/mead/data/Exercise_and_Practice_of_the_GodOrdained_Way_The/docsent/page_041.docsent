   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWELVE THE PRACTICAL PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: John 15:8, 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will fellowship more concerning the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of fellowship should be of help to us in learning how to preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In visiting with people, we should be normal, living, and lovely to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ones we visit should be inspired and moved by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some preach the gospel as though they were reading a newspaper clipping to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result of this kind of preaching is that there is no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others lose the listener by providing too much explanation in their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This creates the opportunity for side issues to come in. If we are asked a question, we should restrict our answer to the point at hand, thus leaving no side issue to be raised by the person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not think that it is better to have a large amount of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This may cause the impact to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is better to speak a few words that are directly to the point to bring the person to the proper destination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way we are like ushers who direct people to their seats in an auditorium.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must learn to purify our speaking and avoid speaking according to our natural custom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>USING PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My main concern is that many of the saints go out diligently and faithfully to talk to people, but most of the speaking is doctrinal in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need training in order to overcome our doctrinal nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The person we are visiting may ask us to explain to him who God is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn not to answer such a question with doctrines but with some kind of practical illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may tell him that in the whole universe there must be a sovereign One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is this sovereign One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to learn to always hit the point and avoid side issues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have practiced gospel preaching for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have discovered that many sinners like to ask a lot of questions which lead into side issues, thus taking you away from the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is best not to follow their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must consider the best way to answer so that the side issues are kept closed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This requires learning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are presented with a question which you cannot answer so well right away, you should still do your best to give an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, you should learn not to answer too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To one who asks who God is, you may say, "This is the biggest question in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The philosophers and religious leaders have always considered this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One thing that is clear to all of them is that there must be someone in the universe who is sovereign."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This leads the person to a direct point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then point out that this sovereign One is called God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is not an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is just God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is one and only one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the One who created the entire universe, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At this time you can direct him to the point which you want to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will keep him from going astray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to be trained, but you also have to consider the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ask yourself how to answer who God is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of thinking and considering will cause you to learn some secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Theology alone does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you talk to people, the greatest impact will be from practical speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are not practical in your speaking, you will create more questions in the ones you contact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must answer in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why you have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not just learn in a doctrinal way in order to go out to give lectures to people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lectures have no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just talk in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, your talk must be based upon Biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the way you use your knowledge of the Bible is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must learn to convert your doctrinal talking into practical talking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not talk like a Bible teacher or theologian but in a practical way, touching people's daily life.</S>
