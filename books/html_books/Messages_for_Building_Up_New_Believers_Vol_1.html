<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>After Watchman Nee resumed his ministry in 1948, he fellowshipped several times with the brothers about the critical need to provide believers with a spiritual education. As a goal, he wanted to provide basic teachings to every brother and sister in the church so that they could have a solid foundation of the truth and express the same testimony among the churches. <em>Messages for Building Up New Believers, </em>Volumes 1&mdash;3, contains fifty-four lessons for new believers, which Watchman Nee released during his workers&rsquo; training in Kuling. These chapters are rich in content and all-inclusive in scope. The truths are basic and crucial. It was Watchman Nee&rsquo;s intention that every local church use this material to build up its new believers, finishing all the lessons in the course of one year and then repeating the same lessons year after year. Four of the fifty-four lessons appear as appendices at theend of Volume 3. These four messages were delivered by Watchman Nee as part of the &ldquo;New Believers&rdquo; series at Kuling mountain but were later removed from the final, published version. We have chosen to include them as appendices. In addition to these four messages, Volume 1 begins with a message given by Watchman Nee at a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in July 1950 concerning the meeting for the building up of new believers. It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions.</p><h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE MEETING<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF NEW BELIEVERS</h1>
<h2 class="head4">(A Talk with Co-workers on July 12, 1950)</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF NEW BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">One</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of his Christian life, every new believer should be taught emphatically to have no trust in himself. Suppose a brother is saved at the age of forty. For the past forty years, he has lived in the world, squandered his days in sin, followed the customs of this age, and been bound by Satan. For the past forty years, he has lived according to his own temperament and walked according to his own concepts, feelings, and ideas. Now that he is saved, he absolutely should not have any further trust in himself. He should have a strong distrust of himself.</p>
<p>Christians have standards. There are standards for the Christian life, Christian ideals, and Christian ideas. Those who do not know these standards do not know the meaning of being perfected. They arrogantly boast about themselves and are prone to be satisfied and confident in themselves. Those who do not know these standards take wrong to be right and right to be wrong. Only those who have learned the lessons and who know these standards can tell others what they should not do and what they should not say. Only they can differentiate between right and wrong. The building up of a new believer consists of teaching such a one the standards of the Christian life so that he can walk accordingly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two</h2>
<p>The first thing a new believer needs is a total and thorough breaking down of this past. Why did the Lord say, &ldquo;Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 18:3)? This means that our past living was wrong. We lived in vanity, and our former days count for nothing! We all should have to have a fresh start. The regeneration that is spoken of in John 3 shows us the need of a <em>new life,</em> while the turning and becoming like little children that is spoken of in Matthew 18 shows us the need of the nullification of our <em>past walk.</em> Everything of the past needs to be torn down and removed. The perfection of a new believer consists of the tearing down of his past item by item. If a man is saved at the age of forty, perfecting means a total destruction of everything that he has acquired during his previous forty years. Many people regret their sins but not themselves. We pass from death into life. We are not putting life into death. The building up of a new believer consists of identifying the things to be dealt with, the things to be eliminated, and the things to be added. Everything should be judged by the biblical standard. If something does not pass this test, if a person&rsquo;s walk is still based on past experiences, past habits, or past concepts, he is living in gross error. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he has to drop every one of his past concepts. Regeneration gives man a new life, whereas turning to become like little children breaks down his past life. On the negative side, the building up of a new believer consists of tearing down everything that he had in the past. On the positive side, it consists of a fresh start for a new living.</p>
<p>If a new believer does not break down everything that he had in the past, he will experience much frustration in his Christian walk. The things he did in the past will continue to haunt him, and what he receives from the Lord will become a mere addition to what he already has from the past. The result will be a mixture of the Lord&rsquo;s life and his past life. He may still consider himself highly, telling others of his sincerity and patience and of his many sufferings. He may be full of pride yet act in a humble way. He may be greedy for vainglory and earthly treasures, yet think that he is above worldly pursuits and base gain. Many sisters have peculiar temperaments; it is hard for them to get along with others. Many parents have strange ideas about their children. They can go on this way as Christians for ten or twenty years. This is why a new believer should have a strong distrust of himself from the very beginning. He should put a big question mark on everything of his past. From this point forward, he has to drop his old concepts, tear down his old ways, remove his old ideas, and get rid of everything that is old. He has to turn and become like a little child and start his life all over again.</p><h2 class="head2">Three</h2>
<p>Baptism means the burial of everything of the past. Suppose that a person who is fifty years old is saved and about to be baptized. The meaning of baptism for him is not just that the Lord buries his life but, more specifically, that the Lord takes away every one of the fifty years of his former life. Sin has permeated his total constitution. He is sick in every respect. Therefore, everything has to go under the water. Then he has to rise from the grave. He also has to get away from the clothes that he wore while he was in the grave. The act of baptism should not stop short of something as serious as this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Four</h2>
<p>As soon as a man is saved, he should have a fundamental change in his concept of values. Every past concept concerning values no longer counts; they were all wrong. Perfecting a new believer means showing him the errors and mistakes of his past concept of values. A man has to see something new; he has to have a new concept of values. What was precious to him is now refuse. What was profitable to him is now loss. He can no longer have the same temperament and use the same vocabulary, and his clothing and food can no longer be the same. He can no longer hold the same view regarding marriage and sex. He needs new views and new concepts about parenthood and friendship. He should be different in his choices of amusements and careers. Everything is new, and he will need a fresh start.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Five</h2>
<p>If we train a new believer lesson by lesson and if he tears down what should be torn down and builds up what needs to be built up, he will come closer and closer to the standard of a normal Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR<br />
DURING THE TRAINING SESSIONS</h2>
<p>In order to strengthen the meeting for the building up of new believers, we must first train the brothers and sisters and then assign them to take care of the new ones. Hopefully, no new believer would skip this process. Those who are trained to take care of the new believers should note the following:</p>
<p>(1) Do not put all your trust in your speaking. Encourage asking. First Corinthians 14:35 speaks of asking. This means that the early churches gave the saints much freedom to ask questions. A meeting that affords no opportunity for asking is surely an overly formal one. The leaders have to encourage the audience to ask questions and to talk about the things that they do not understand.</p>
<p>(2) In answering questions, do not save your face at the expense of the truth. If you know the answer, say that you know it. If you do not know the answer, say that you do not know it.</p>
<p>(3) Every leading one should ask himself whether he is representing himself or the truth. Everyone should represent the truth. No one should represent his own feelings or temperament. He must uphold the truth rather than his own feelings. No one should express his own opinions. For example, in the matter of head covering, a leading one may not understand everything about this truth. He cannot, therefore, tell others that this is optional. God&rsquo;s truth is absolute, and we have to speak the same thing. If our trumpets give uncertain sounds, we will fight uncertain battles. Even if a person has some disagreement, he should only express himself through constructive suggestions, not destructive criticisms.</p>
<p>(4) Every leading one should realize from the first day that his place is only that of a channel; he is here to communicate God&rsquo;s word; he is not the master or the teacher. He should be like a man in a low place communicating to another man in a low place. He should not be like a man in a high place teaching another man in a low place. No one can assume the place of a teacher. Everyone has to take the place of a messenger.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p>Since the building up of new believers is a basic training, I hope that all the local churches will have such a meeting&mdash;the new believers&rsquo; building-up meeting. Let me now cover some practical considerations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Who a New Believer Is</h2>
<p>As soon as a sinner has believed in the Lord and is baptized, he is a new believer. Starting from the week that he is baptized, he should attend the new believers meeting. After a year, he will have heard most of the things that he should hear and should have learned most of the things that he should learn. Then we can say that such a Christian has gone through the basic training. From that point on, we can expect him to receive further, deeper building up.</p>
<p>As soon as a sinner believes, he needs to attend the new believers meeting no matter how old he is, how educated he is, how high a position he occupies, or how experienced he is in the world. If his past is not torn down, it will be difficult for him to live a proper Christian life. Therefore, as soon as a person believes and is baptized, irrespective of who he is, we have to treat him as a new believer and invite him to the new believers meeting.</p>
<p>Those who have never gone through this kind of basic training, even though they have been believers for many years, can also attend the new believers meetings if they so desire. The purpose of these meetings is to tear down the old and build up the new. It is not a question of how many years a person has believed in the Lord but of how much of his past has been torn down since becoming a believer. I know a brother who has never confessed his sins to anyone in his whole life. Yet he is now a responsible brother! It does not matter how many years he has been a Christian. As far as his spiritual experience is concerned, he needs a fresh start and should join the new believers meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Days for the New Believers Meeting</h2>
<p>In making arrangements for the new believers meeting, all the churches should try their best to set aside Wednesday or Thursday. Whether this meeting involves many people or few people, the whole congregation or small classes, it should be on Wednesday or Thursday. This should be done week after week. Whenever a new believer goes to another place that has a church, he should be able to join in immediately and not miss any lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Training Meetings</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Periodic Intensified Trainings</h2>
<p>These short-term trainings are conducted by one brother (possibly one of the co-workers) when he gathers together all the brothers in a district or region who are capable of ministering the word. Every short-term training should cover at least ten to twenty lessons. By conducting three or four such trainings, all of the subjects will be covered. When these brothers return to their respective localities, they can bear the responsibility of teaching in the local new believers meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Weekly Local Trainings</h2>
<p>A place such as Shanghai has many new believers. If we divide them into several dozen classes, we would need over a hundred leading ones. In order to take care of this, we can ask one brother to head up the matter by gathering the leading ones every week to train them. On the one hand, they can discuss the problems and the mistakes of the past week. On the other hand, they can study the topics for the following week. The best time to do this is Friday. If Friday is not available, it should be done no later than Monday. This will give them at least three to seven days to prepare their lessons, and they will not lose focus of the main points of the messages.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lesson Books and Notebooks</h2>
<p>During the training sessions, if a new learner does not have a copy of the book, he will have to take notes. If he has the book, he must read the lesson carefully. If he comes across anything that he does not understand, he should ask, and everyone should discuss it together. They should consider what the main subject of the lesson is, how many sections it has, what the main points in each section are, and what the crucial words and important teachings in each section are. They should identify the things that need to be torn down and what needs to be built up. They should study the lesson section by section and ask questions while they listen. Then they should go to their respective classes the following Thursday to conduct their own meetings.</p><h2 class="head3">Achieving the Objectives</h2>
<p>In delivering a lesson, the main goal is not to help the new believers understand more teachings but to do some carving work on them. One should pay attention to the areas that require carving; he should know what needs to be torn down and what needs to be added. These lessons should serve as tools to build up the believers and to make new persons out of them. Of course, in order to achieve the desired objective, the leading ones first must be dealt with in the area they are speaking about. Otherwise, their speaking will not be genuine. They will only speak vain words, and these words will be powerless. Everyone who is responsible for the new believers meeting should pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dividing Up the Classes</h2>
<p>If a church has very few new believers or if there are not enough speakers, there is no need to divide the new believers into classes. In such cases one person should simply bear the responsibility of teaching these lessons, followed by questions, week after week. But if a church has many new believers, these believers should be divided into smaller classes and should be trained separately. Division of classes can be according to geography or level of understanding. Adjust according to the local practical need. If there is an adequate number of leaders, the classes can range from a few persons to perhaps a dozen or so. In dividing up the classes, one should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<h2 class="head3">Paying Attention to the Students</h2>
<p>Suppose one class has a relatively high standard of literacy. We should arrange to have stronger ones teach such a class. If another class consists of those with a lower standard of literacy, the leading one in the class should be experienced in teaching the truth in a simple way. Once we have the right kind of students for the right teachers, the leading ones will not find it difficult to teach, and the audience will be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head3">When Not Using the Textbook</h2>
<p>In some places only the leaders have the book. In this case everyone in the audience should carry a notebook and write down the crucial points and the subject of every portion. In some classes the new believers may be illiterate or semi-literate. In such circumstances there is no need to pass out the book. The leading one should pick out at least one crucial verse and read it to the audience again and again. He should also ask them to repeat it after him. Then he should explain the main points of the lesson to them. He should ask them if they understand the lesson and give them the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<h2 class="head3">When Using the Textbook</h2>
<p>In places where the textbook is used, everyone should be given a copy during the meeting. The leader should help the new believers read the lesson together or take turns reading it section by section. The leading one should ask questions as he moves along, and the listeners should also feel free to ask questions as they listen. Sometimes the listeners can be asked to say something, but their speaking has to be brief and should not occupy too much time. This will make the meeting more lively. Try your best to avoid lectures or sermons. Those who can take notes should prepare a notebook and write down the important points throughout the course of the lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Time</h2>
<p>Every meeting should be limited to one and a half hours. The meeting should not drag on.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Things to Pay Attention to in<br />
Speaking, Asking, and Answering</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Speaking</h2>
<p>Our voices should be loud enough for the whole class to hear. Do not stray off the subject. Examples or stories must fit the subject. It is best to speak the main points in a clear way according to the text of the lesson. Do not take advantage of the occasion to speak what you want to speak. Do not go off on a tangent. Do not sermonize, but mix your speaking with questions.</p><h2 class="head3">Asking</h2>
<p>Questions should be pertinent and limited to the subject of the lesson. Do not stray into unrelated subjects. For example, in speaking about &ldquo;Salvation through Faith and Baptism&rdquo; in the lesson on baptism, we only should ask what this aspect of salvation refers to. Do not jump from the salvation spoken of in this lesson to the salvation of the soul, and then from the salvation of the soul to the matter of the kingdom, and then from the kingdom to the difference between entering into the kingdom and going to heaven. If the scope is too broad and the questions stray too far from the subject, the original subject will be lost, and the discussion will become unfruitful.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Answering</h2>
<p>Answers must be clear. If the questions are off the subject, you can answer by saying that it is a priority to know the lesson itself and that other questions can be saved until later. For example, if someone raises a question about salvation by grace or about the salvation of the soul during the lesson on baptism, just answer by saying that there are several aspects to salvation and that in this particular portion we are only concerned about the meaning of salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Paying Attention to Whether or Not the Lesson<br />
Has Been Put into Practice</h2>
<p>Do not worry about repeating the message. A man can hear a message this year and forget about it the next year, and when you check with him the third year, he still may not have put the lesson into practice. Our purpose is not just to speak something to the new believers but to <em>check</em> whether or not they are practicing what they have heard. We should not speak something and then forget about it. Instead, we should ask whether or not they are doing what they have heard. For example, we may speak about rising early. We must check with them to see if they are rising early. If we speak about reading the Bible, we have to check with them to see if they are reading the Bible. When we speak on prayer, we have to check with them to see if they are praying. We have to keep pushing and checking with them, until they begin to practice and deal with these things conscientiously.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Make-up Lessons</h2>
<p>The leading ones have to find out how much time they should spend on a lesson and how long they should continue with it. However, I hope that the difference in pace will not be too great. If some have missed something or are too much behind, we should arrange for make-up lessons. In conducting the make-up lessons, we have to be serious about it. We have to be thorough in making up what we ourselves have missed. If we are not serious about it, we will not have anything to impart to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A FRESH SPIRIT</h2>
<p>These lessons should be taught year after year. They should be taught continuously. Hence, the speakers must learn to be fresh in their spirit. The truths will be the same ten years from now, but the spirit cannot be the same. If the leading ones have learned to exercise their spirit and if their spirit is fresh, they can repeat a lesson again and again for ten or twenty years. If others are to be touched by your word, this word first must touch your own spirit. You must have a fresh touch of the spirit. If your spirit is old and you pass on only teachings, others will only receive help in doctrine. The doctrine will become something like the &ldquo;Common Prayer,&rdquo; which men recite in services week after week. But if you touch the word with your spirit, repetition will not become a problem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>The Christian life is a life that hinges on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. If the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is with us, we will not be off the mark by too much even when the practical arrangements are not altogether desirable. But if the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is not with us, we will not have good results even if all the arrangements are perfect. In some cases the Lord still grants His blessing even when circumstances are not all that ideal. In other cases the Lord&rsquo;s blessing may be held back because of just a slight mistake. A Christian should not be after the achievement of outward correctness, but the way of divine blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BAPTISM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet. 3:20-21; Rom. 6:3-4; Col. 2:12</h1>
<p>Baptism is a great subject in the Bible. We need to be clear about two aspects concerning baptism. First, before we are baptized, we need to be clear as to what baptism can do for us. Second, after we are baptized, we need to look backward and ask, &ldquo;What is the significance of baptism?&rdquo; In the first case, the baptism pool and the water are before us. As we are going to be baptized, we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;What can baptism do for me?&rdquo; After our baptism, we need to ask, &ldquo;What is the meaning of my baptism?&rdquo; One is a question posed in foresight, and the other is a question posed in hindsight. The former touches one&rsquo;s knowledge prior to baptism, and the latter, one&rsquo;s understanding after baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT BAPTISM DOES FOR A PERSON</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). This verse shows what baptism does for a person.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Baptism Saving Man from the World</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; I suppose that all Protestants are a little afraid of this verse. Therefore, they dare not read it. Whenever they read this verse, they change it to, &ldquo;He who believes and is saved shall be baptized.&rdquo; But the Lord&rsquo;s Word does not say this. In order to avoid the error of Catholicism, the Protestants deliberately go around God&rsquo;s Word. However, as they evade the error of Catholicism, they fall into another error. The Lord&rsquo;s Word is clear: &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; Man has no authority to change it to, &ldquo;He who believes and is saved shall be baptized.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Salvation Being a Deliverance from the World</h2>
<p>Let us now pay attention to the meaning of the word salvation in the Bible. What is a person being saved from? According to the Bible, a man is saved from the world, not hell. The opposite of eternal life is perdition, but the Bible does not regard salvation as the opposite of perdition. The Bible shows us that salvation is one&rsquo;s deliverance from the world. As long as a person is in the world, he is already in perdition.</p>
<p>Let us consider man&rsquo;s condition before God. Today man does not have to do anything to perish. I will not perish because I have killed someone, and I will not be saved from perdition because I have not killed someone. The fact is that the whole world is perishing. From among the perishing ones, God has pulled us out and saved us. The whole world is perishing corporately, but God is saving men one by one, individually. God does not catch all the fish from the sea and then separate the good from the bad, assigning some to salvation while destining others to perdition. All the fish in the sea are perishing. Those which are caught by God are saved; the rest remain in the sea.</p>
<p>Hence, the matter of salvation and perdition has nothing to do with whether or not you have believed or how good your conduct is; it has to do with your location. If you are in the boat, you are saved. If you are still in the sea, you are perishing. You may not have done anything, but as long as you are in the world, that is enough for you to perish. It does not matter whether you are good or bad, a gentleman or a villain. It does not matter whether or not you live by your conscience. As long as you are in the world, you are finished. If you have not left that place, you are condemned by God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Salvation Being a Matter of Position</h2>
<p>Because Adam sinned and became a sinner, all men became sinners. Man need not sin to be qualified as a sinner. All have become sinners through one man&rsquo;s sin. Today God has saved you from among many men. If you are on the world&rsquo;s side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God&rsquo;s enemy. Your position is wrong; it is a perishing position, one that leads to perdition. If you are a person in the world, you are perishing.</p>
<p>The word <em>salvation</em> has been used freely among us and with much confusion. There is a distinction between salvation and obtaining eternal life. Obtaining eternal life is a personal matter, but salvation is a matter not only of receiving the eternal life personally but also of coming out from a wrong corporate body. Brothers and sisters, are you clear about this distinction? Receiving eternal life is a personal matter. Salvation, however, is not just a personal matter; it has to do with the corporate body to which you formerly belonged.</p>
<p>Salvation means coming out of one corporate body into another. The receiving of eternal life speaks of what one has entered into; it does not speak of what one has come out of. Salvation includes both a coming out of and an entering in. Therefore, the scope of salvation is wider than that of receiving eternal life. It includes being delivered from the world, that is, coming out of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Four Major Facts Concerning<br />
the World before God</h2>
<p>There are four major facts concerning the world as shown in the Bible: (1) The world is condemned in the eyes of God, (2) the world lies in the evil one, (3) the world has crucified the Lord Jesus, and (4) the world is at enmity with God; it is God&rsquo;s enemy. These are the four major facts concerning the world before God. As long as a person is in the world, he is already condemned and will perish regardless of his conduct.</p>
<p>Please remember that the salvation of men is not a matter of personal conduct. They are wrong because their position is wrong. We know that it is not easy to be delivered from the world. How can I forsake the world if it is still attractive to me? However, when I realize that the world is in a wrong position with respect to God, I will have to forsake it no matter how lovely it may be to me. Hence, salvation is not just a matter of our personal conduct. The corporate body to which we belong is wrong. We need to be saved from our relationship with and our position in the world.</p>
<p>When the Jews tried to do away with the Lord Jesus, they cried, &ldquo;His blood be upon us and upon our children!&rdquo; (Matt. 27:25). Although we are not the ones who killed the Lord Jesus, our forefathers did. Even though we did not commit the act, the corporate body to which we belong did. The corporate body to which we belong is an enemy of God and is condemned to perish. Whether we are right or wrong individually is another matter. I hope you can see not only that we are sinners individually and need to be saved individually, but that we also belong to a corporate body which is wrong. The world to which we belong is God&rsquo;s enemy. The world we are in is condemned by God. We need to be delivered from that relationship and that position.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Salvation Being<br />
to Come Out of the World</h2>
<p>What is salvation? Salvation is a deliverance from a certain corporate body. It is a deliverance from a certain position and certain relationships. In other words, it means to come out of the world. Most people pay much attention to their personal salvation, but the question before us is what are they saved from. The salvation highlighted in the Bible involves being saved from the world, not from hell. The world as a whole is condemned by God.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that he who believes has eternal life. We have been preaching this for many years. Once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he has eternal life and is saved forever. All problems are solved. But please remember that if a person believes but is not baptized, he is still not saved. Indeed, you may have believed and you may have eternal life, but are you saved in the eyes of the world? If you are not baptized, you are not saved, because no one knows that you are different. You must rise up and be baptized, declaring that you have terminated your relationship with the world. Only then will you be saved.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Believing Being on the Positive Side,<br />
and Baptism Being on the Negative Side</h2>
<p>What then is baptism? Baptism is a deliverance. Believing is on the positive side and baptism is on the negative side. Baptism delivers you out of that corporate body. Many people in the world may say that you are one of them. But the moment you are baptized, they will realize you are finished. The one whom they have known for years is now saved and baptized. Your friendship with them is terminated. You are in the tomb; you have reached the end of your road. You already know that you have eternal life. Now that you are baptized, you are <em>saved.</em> From now on, everyone knows that you are the Lord&rsquo;s and that you belong to Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; This is true because once a person believes and is baptized, everyone will know where he stands. Without believing, there is no inward reality, and what one does will be nothing but an outward display. With believing, there is inward reality, and if one takes a further step to be baptized, he will be separated from the world, having terminated his relationship with it. Baptism is a separation. It separates us from others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus&rsquo; word is quite clear. It goes on by saying, &ldquo;He who does not believe shall be condemned.&rdquo; Unbelief alone is sufficient for condemnation. As long as a person belongs to that corporate body, his unbelief is sufficient for condemnation. But if one has believed, he still needs to be baptized. If he is not baptized, he still has not made an exit outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. A Very Amazing Thing in the World</h2>
<p>A very amazing thing in the world today is the attitude of Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam toward baptism.</p>
<p>Any Jew who embraces the Christian faith in secret will not be persecuted. Many Jews believe in the historical record concerning the Lord Jesus. Their greatest hurdle is not in believing in Him but in baptism. Once they are baptized, they are cast out. Some sisters were poisoned by their fianc&#233; after they were baptized. Such things happen even in civilized communities like London and New York. It is all right for a person to believe in his heart, but once he is baptized, others will persecute him.</p>
<p>In India, no one will do anything to a believer if he is not baptized. But once he is baptized, they will cast him out. It is all right for one to believe in the Lord, but he cannot be baptized.</p>
<p>The reaction of the Muslims is more violent. Someone once said that it is difficult for a Muslim believer to remain alive. As soon as he believes, he will die. Dr. Swema is the first person who succeeded in working among the Muslims. He said, &ldquo;My work will never grow, because once a person believes in the Lord, he has to be sent away immediately. Otherwise, he will die within two or three days after his baptism.&rdquo; This condition is prevalent even among Muslims today.</p>
<p>Baptism is an open declaration that one has come out. &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; We should never consider the salvation here to mean a personal salvation of the spirit. In the Bible, salvation signifies a deliverance from the world, not deliverance from hell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Baptism Being for the Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the apostles told the Jews, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). The Protestants have difficulty accepting this verse. But this verse is the plain word of the apostles. &ldquo;Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.&rdquo; It is strange that the emphasis of the apostle&rsquo;s word is not upon faith but upon baptism.</p>
<p>Was the focus of Peter&rsquo;s message in Acts 2 on persuading men to believe? No. Does this mean that Peter&rsquo;s preaching was inferior to ours? The Bible tells us that the most crucial thing concerning salvation is faith. How could Peter have left this out? Perhaps he could ignore other doctrines in his message, but how could he not speak about faith? Nevertheless, he did not speak about it. Instead, he spoke about baptism, and the Holy Spirit pricked the heart of those who listened. What about us? We say that faith alone is enough. We think this is orthodox Christianity. Yet Peter said, &ldquo;Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter spoke only of baptism because those who listened to him were the ones who had killed the Lord Jesus. Fifty days prior to that, they were crying, &ldquo;Take this man away.&rdquo; These were the same people who were shouting and crying in Jerusalem. Now they needed to be separated from the rest of the Jews. This is why it was not necessary to speak to them about believing. They only needed to be baptized. That would be sufficient for them to get out. As soon as they were baptized, their relationship with that corporate body would be terminated. As soon as they were baptized, they would leave that corporate body and their sins would be washed away. They would no longer be part of that corporate body; they would be out of it. This is why Peter said, &ldquo;Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.&rdquo; The act of baptism brought them out. As soon as they came out, all problems were solved.</p>
<p>You need to realize that you were originally in the world and that you were an enemy of God. Since you have come out, you are saved. You need to confess before God and before men that you have come out and have nothing to do with that corporate body. You are through with it. &ldquo;Be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This was the main teaching on the day of Pentecost. At this point your mind needs to be directed by God&rsquo;s Word, not by Protestant theology.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Baptism Being for the Washing Away of Sins</h2>
<p>Let us consider the case of Paul. Ananias came to Paul and said to him, &ldquo;Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name&rdquo; (Acts 22:16).</p>
<p>Paul was the foremost and greatest teacher, prophet, and apostle of Christianity. Was there a little error in his experience? Sometimes we preach the right doctrines but have the wrong experience. What would happen when we gave our testimony? What would happen if others did the same thing we do? The testimony of a teacher is very important because it may mislead others. Could it be that the experience of the foremost teacher of Christianity was wrong?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name.&rdquo; Please take note of this verse. It says that baptism can wash away one&rsquo;s sins. The Catholics quote this verse and regard it as a personal matter before God. The error of Catholicism lies in saying, &ldquo;If <em>you</em> are baptized, <em>your</em> sins will be washed away.&rdquo; Therefore, they claim that a death-bed baptism can wash away sins. They do not realize that the significance of this matter is not before God but before the world.</p>
<p>Formerly, Paul was a man in the world. After he had believed in the Lord Jesus and had seen Him, he needed to rise up and be baptized. The moment he was baptized, his sins were washed away. The moment he severed his relationship with the world, his sins were gone. If you are a Christian secretly and are not baptized, the world may still consider you as one of them. You may say that you are saved, but the world will not admit it. You may say that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, but they will say that they have not seen it. Once you get into the water, they will see it; they will know that you have believed in Jesus. Otherwise, why should a person be so foolish as to get into the water? The moment you are baptized, you are freed from the world. Water baptism is a severance of one&rsquo;s relationship with the world.</p>
<p>If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it. For instance, in Kuling of Fukien there is a strong tradition of idol worship every fall; everyone is required to donate some money. If a person merely says that he has believed in the Lord, others will not believe him. But the moment he is baptized, they will know that he is no longer one of them. Therefore, baptism is the best way to free oneself from the world. If you want to be freed from the world, you must be baptized. You must tell the world, &ldquo;My relationship with you is over.&rdquo; By doing this, you come out of the world.</p>
<p>Baptism is an open testimony, and we should not be afraid to let others witness it. Unbelievers can also be present during our baptism. Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, &ldquo;We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way. There were too many spectators.&rdquo; If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly. Even the baptisms of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost were not that orderly. The issue is not whether a meeting is orderly. Of course, it is not good to be disorderly. But all the brothers and sisters should know what we are doing. When we baptize someone, we should let the whole world witness what we are doing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Baptism Leading to Salvation through Water</h2>
<p>The Scripture is consistent in its principles. First Peter 3:20 says, &ldquo;In the days of Noah...a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.&rdquo; This verse shows us again that baptism leads to salvation. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; On the day of Pentecost, Peter said, &ldquo;Be baptized...for the forgiveness of your sins.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s action shows us that when a person is baptized, his sins are washed away. They are not just forgiven, but washed away. This is because our sins are washed away when we sever our relationship with the world. Here, the word in 1 Peter also shows us that we are saved through water. Therefore, baptism leads to salvation through water.</p>
<p>Those who cannot pass the test of water are not saved. A person who cannot pass through water drowns. During Noah&rsquo;s time, everyone was baptized, but only eight souls came out. All the people were baptized and immersed in the water, but only eight souls emerged from it. In other words, the water became the water of death to some, but to others it was the water of salvation. Others go into the water and remain there, but we pass through the water and emerge from it. There is something positive in Peter&rsquo;s word. When the flood came, everyone drowned. Only the eight souls in the ark, whom the water could not overcome, emerged from it. While the rest perished, these eight souls were saved. Today the whole world is under the wrath of God. For one to be baptized today means that he goes through God&rsquo;s wrath. But he does not only go through it; he comes out of it. His emergence from it shows that he is one who has come out. This is baptism.</p>
<p>Baptism is being immersed on one side and emerging out of water on the other side. Baptism means passing through and emerging from the water. You must emphasize the aspect of &ldquo;emergence.&rdquo; Everyone went into the water, but only the eight souls came out. Today we are saved through baptism. What does this mean? When I am baptized, I do not go into the water and remain there. Rather, I enter into the water and emerge from it. If you have never believed in the Lord Jesus, your baptism will not result in an emergence. Today my going into the water and coming out of it means that I am different from you. I can come out from the world through the water. I testify to others that I am different from the world.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Baptism Freeing Us from the World</h2>
<p>The above four portions of the Scripture clearly show us what baptism is. Once we are baptized, we are freed from the world. We do not need years to be freed from the world. The first thing for a new believer to do is to be baptized. You must see the position of the world before God. You have renounced your former position in the world. This is salvation. You must put off the world completely. From now on, you are no longer a part of the world; you are on the other side.</p>
<p>Once we believe in the Lord, we should realize that we are no longer a part of the world. Our baptism is a sign that we are freed from the world. Through baptism we assume a different role. Henceforth, we abide in the ark and are persons on the other side. We can tell others that we do not do certain things because we have believed in Jesus. But, even more, we can tell others that we do not do them because we are baptized. We have crossed the bridge; we are on the other side.</p>
<p>Today we must recover the place of baptism before God. What is the meaning of baptism? Baptism means to come out of the world. It is a step which we take to free ourselves from the world. Our baptism is a declaration to others that we are out. This is like the words of a hymn which say, &ldquo;Then the grave, with dear ones weeping, / Knowing that all life has fled&rdquo; <em>(Hymns,</em> #628). Our dear ones know that we are finished and that we have come to the end of our road. We are through. Only this kind of baptism is effective. If this is not our realization, our baptism is too light and insubstantial. We must realize that we have been freed from the old circle and have come out of it. Eternal life is something that our spirit gains before God, but salvation is an act of our separation from the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Everyone who is already baptized needs to look back and consider the meaning of baptism. Even if you were baptized ten or twenty years ago, you still need to review this matter. We should always remember the verse which says, &ldquo;Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&rdquo; (Rom. 6:3). This verse is spoken in retrospect, not as a forethought.</p>
<p>The verses in Mark 16, Acts 2, Acts 22, and 1 Peter 3 are for those who have not yet been baptized, whereas the verses in Romans 6 and Colossians 2 are for those who have been baptized. They address those who have been baptized already. God is telling them, &ldquo;Do you not know that when you were baptized, you died together with Christ and were buried and resurrected together with Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 6 emphasizes death and burial even though it also speaks of resurrection. Colossians 2 is more advanced; it emphasizes burial and resurrection, with resurrection as the focus. The emphasis of Romans 6 is death: &ldquo;Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&rdquo; The main point here is death. We should die together with Christ. Romans 6 is on death and burial, whereas Colossians 2 is on burial and resurrection.</p>
<p>The water of baptism typifies the tomb. Today, when we put a person into the water, it is as if we are burying him in the ground. When we raise him up from the water, it is equivalent to raising him up from the tomb. Before one can be buried, he must first be dead. You cannot bury a living person. If a person rises up again after he is buried, this is surely resurrection. The first part of this truth is found in Romans, and the second part of this truth is found in Colossians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Great Gospel&mdash;I Am Dead</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He carried us along with Him to the cross; we were crucified there as well. In the eyes of God, He has terminated us. What do you think of yourself? You may say, &ldquo;I am a terrible person to deal with!&rdquo; Those who do not know themselves do not realize how impossible they are. A person who knows God and who knows himself will say, &ldquo;I am an impossible person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we were heavy-laden with sin, we heard of the death of the Lord Jesus. This is the gospel. Then we saw that we were beyond all hope and that we were dead. This is also the gospel. Thank God, this is the gospel! The Lord&rsquo;s death has included all of us. We are dead in Christ. This is a great gospel! Just as the Lord&rsquo;s death is a great gospel, our own death is also a great gospel. Just as the Lord&rsquo;s death is a joyful matter, our own death is also a joyful matter. What should be the first thought that comes to our mind when we hear that our Lord has died? We should be like Joseph of Arimathea; we should bury Him. Similarly, when we hear that we are dead, the first thing that we should do is to bury ourselves, because burial is the first thing that follows death. Death is not the end. We are already dead in Christ; therefore, the first thing we need to do is bury ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having Died and Risen</h2>
<p>Brothers, when we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years, we must remember that we are already dead. We allowed others to bury us because we believed that we were already dead. If our heart is still beating and we are still breathing, we cannot be buried. In order to be buried, we must be dead.</p>
<p>When the Lord was crucified, we were crucified too. We allowed others to put us into the water because we believed that we had died. The Lord Jesus has resurrected; He has put His resurrection power within us. Now we are regenerated through this power. This resurrection power operates within us and causes us to be resurrected. This is why we rose from the water. We are no longer our former self; we are now resurrected persons. Today, we must always remind ourselves of this matter. When we went into the water, we believed that we died and needed to be buried. When we came up from the water, we believed that we had newness of life. Now we are on the side of resurrection. Death is on the other side, but resurrection is on this side.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. I Am in Christ</h2>
<p>Once I saw a headline in the newspaper which read, &ldquo;One Person, Three Lives.&rdquo; The article was about a pregnant woman who had been murdered. After the woman died, it became known that she was pregnant with twins. Hence, the headline read, &ldquo;One Person, Three Lives.&rdquo; Please note that concerning the Lord, it is, &ldquo;One Person, Millions of Lives.&rdquo; This is why the Bible repeatedly emphasizes the words <em>in Christ.</em> In the murder spoken of above, the murderer apparently killed only the mother; he did not kill the two children. However, because the two children were in their mother&rsquo;s womb, they died when their mother died. Likewise, since we are in Christ, when Christ died, we died in Him.</p>
<p>God has put us into Christ Jesus. This is the revelation in 1 Corinthians 1:30: &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Since Christ has died, we are all dead. The basis for our co-death with Christ is our being in Christ. If we do not know what being in Christ means, we will not understand what dying with Him means either. How could the children die with their mother? They died because they were in their mother&rsquo;s womb. The analogy in the spiritual realm is even more real. God has joined us to Christ. When Christ died, we died also.</p>
<p>As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God&rsquo;s viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord. We have died because we believed this to be a fact. We have been buried in the water and have come out of it. We declare that we are on this side of the tomb. This is resurrection. Reckoning in Romans 6 involves both reckoning oneself dead in Christ Jesus and reckoning oneself alive in Him as well.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I hope that you will take this way once you are saved. These are two separate thoughts. One thought comes before baptism, and the other comes after baptism. Before baptism we must see that we have already died and that we need to be buried. After baptism we must realize that we are in resurrection and that we can therefore serve God today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">TERMINATING THE PAST</h1>
<p>Today we come to the question of how a person deals with his past after believing in the Lord. After believing in the Lord, a person still carries many things of the past with him. How should he terminate these things?</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TEACHING OF THE BIBLE BEING CONCERNED<br />
WITH WHAT ONE DOES AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p>The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, but especially the New Testament, shows that God does not pay attention to what a person does before he believes in the Lord. Try to find a verse from Matthew 1 to Revelation 22 on how believers should terminate their past, and you will see how hard it is to find something on this subject. Even the Epistles, which touch on our wrongdoings in the past, mainly tell us what we should do <em>hereafter,</em> not what we should do <em>about our past.</em> The books of Ephesians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians all cover something about our past, but they do not tell us how we should terminate our past; they only tell us how we should go on.</p>
<p>You may recall that someone asked John the Baptist, &ldquo;What then shall we do?&rdquo; John answered, &ldquo;He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.&rdquo; He did not talk about their past but about their future. Some tax collectors came to John and asked what they should do. John answered, &ldquo;Exact nothing more than what you have been ordered to.&rdquo; Some soldiers also asked, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; John replied, &ldquo;Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything by false accusation, and be content with your wages&rdquo; (Luke 3:10-14). This shows us that John, who preached repentance, emphasized the things that we should do hereafter, not the things of the past.</p>
<p>Let us also consider Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. He always emphasized what we should do in the future, not what we should do regarding the past, because everything of the past has been covered under the precious blood. If we err a little in this matter, we will corrupt the gospel; we will corrupt the way of the Lord, the way of repentance, and the way of restitution. We must deal with this subject carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God. And these things were some of you&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:9-11a). Here Paul speaks of the believers&rsquo; past conduct, but he does not say how they should deal with it. &ldquo;But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:11b). The emphasis here is not on dealing with the past, because we have a Savior who has already dealt with all our past. Today the emphasis is on what we should do hereafter. A saved person is already washed, sanctified, and justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 2:1-5). These verses do not tell us how we should terminate the things of the flesh. There is only one termination&mdash;our Lord&rsquo;s termination of everything for us based upon the great love with which God loved us and the rich mercy of God.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:17-24 also speaks of our past condition. &ldquo;This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness...that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore having put off the lie&rdquo; (Eph. 4:25a). This refers to the things hereafter. It does not tell us how to deal with our past falsehood but that <em>henceforth</em> we should no longer remain in falsehood. Today we must &ldquo;speak truth each one with his neighbor....Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the devil&rdquo; (Eph. 4:25b-27). These verses do not refer to the past but to the future. &ldquo;He who steals should steal no more&rdquo; (Eph. 4:28a). Paul did not say that he who steals needs to return what was stolen. His emphasis is still on hereafter. What was stolen in the past is another matter. &ldquo;But rather should labor, working with his own hands in that which is respectable...Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God....Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking be removed from you, with all malice&rdquo; (Eph. 4:28b-31).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints, and obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks&rdquo; (Eph. 5:3-4). These words are still in the same principle. They speak of things after one believes in the Lord. They are not about the termination of things done before one believes in the Lord.</p>
<p>After reading all the Epistles, we find a marvelous truth: God pays attention only to what a person should do after he has believed in the Lord. He does not pay attention to the things he has done in his past. He does not tell us what to do with them. This is a basic principle.</p>
<p>Many people are in bondage because they have accepted a wrong gospel. Such a gospel places too much stress on dealing with one&rsquo;s past. This does not mean that we do not need to deal with our past. Certain things of our past must be dealt with, but such a dealing is not the foundation of our going on. God always draws our attention to the fact that our past sins are under the blood. We are fully forgiven and saved because the Lord Jesus has died for us. Our salvation is not based on how we deal with the past. Man is not saved by repentance for his past bad deeds, just as he is not saved by trusting in his past good deeds. Man is saved through the salvation accomplished by the Lord on the cross. We should hold fast to this foundation.</p><h2 class="head1">II. NEW TESTAMENT EXAMPLES<br />
OF DEALING WITH THE PAST</h2>
<p>What then should we do with the things of our past? In reading the New Testament, I have spent much time to find out how one should terminate his past after believing in the Lord. I found only a few passages where the subject is mentioned briefly. However, they are not teachings but examples.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Matters Related to Idols<br />
Needing to Be Dealt with Thoroughly</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 1:9 says, &ldquo;You turned to God from the idols.&rdquo; When a person believes in the Lord, he must deal with all idols. Please remember that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. What agreement does the temple of God have with idols? Even the apostle John, in addressing the believers, said, &ldquo;Little children, guard yourselves from idols&rdquo; (1 John 5:21). Hence, this is not as simple a matter as many may think.</p>
<p>One thing we must take note of is that God forbids man to make an image of anything. We cannot consider a man-made object to be living. The moment we have such a thought, the object becomes an idol to us. Of course, idols are nothing, but if we consider them to be living, we fall into error. This is why God forbids the worship of such things. Even an inclination in the heart towards them is forbidden. One of the Ten Commandments forbids the making of idols (Deut. 5:8).</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 12:30 says, &ldquo;Be careful...lest you seek after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?&rdquo; This shows us that we should not even inquire how the Gentiles worship their gods. Some who are curious like to study how the nations worship and serve their gods. But God forbids us to inquire about such matters. If we inquire about them, the next thing we will do is worship their gods. Hence, we are forbidden from being curious.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 6:16 says, &ldquo;What agreement does the temple of God have with idols?&rdquo; The meaning here is quite obvious. Christians should not visit temples. There are exceptions of course, such as when a person is stranded on a deserted mountain and cannot find a place for shelter at night and there is only a temple for lodging. But generally speaking, believers should not visit any temple. This is because 2 Corinthians 6:16 says clearly that we are the temple of the living God. It also says that there is no agreement between idols and the temple of the living God. Unless one is pressed by special occasion or circumstance, it is inadvisable to go near or purposely tour any temple. John says, &ldquo;Little children, guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; Guarding ourselves from idols means staying away from them.</p>
<p>Psalm 16:4 says, &ldquo;Nor will I take up their names upon My lips.&rdquo; Even at the pulpit, we should carefully avoid the names of other gods except in the case of a necessary illustration. We should not hold on to any superstition, fear of misfortune, or taboo for certain associations or words. Many believers still pay attention to fortunes, the reading of facial features, and destinies. Everything related to fortune-telling or horoscopes is prohibited. Everything in the realm of idolatry should be dealt with thoroughly before God. We should sever our relationship with it completely.</p>
<p>A new believer must give up his idols from the very first day of his salvation. He should not mention the names of idols, be involved with fortune-telling, or visit any temples. We cannot worship anything with an image. Even the thought of worshipping such things is forbidden. We cannot inquire about the worship of other religions. All these things belong to the past, and we should deal with them. Anything that falls into these categories should be destroyed; they should not even be sold. We should destroy, exterminate, and remove them. I hope that new believers will not take this matter lightly; they have to be very careful about these things, for God is extremely jealous of idols.</p>
<p>If you cannot take a strong stand against idols today, you will have a hard time escaping the greatest idol on earth in the future. Of course, we should not worship idols made of clay or wood. But even if there is an idol that is living, we must not worship it. There are actually living idols&mdash;the man of lawlessness (2 Thes. 2:3) being one. Please remember that you cannot worship any idols; you must reject all of them, even images of the Lord Jesus and Mary.</p>
<p>We must deal with this matter thoroughly. Otherwise, we will be distracted to follow another way. We are those who serve not in the flesh but in spirit. God is seeking those who serve Him in spirit, not in the flesh. God is Spirit, not an image. If all the brothers and sisters take care of this matter, they will not fall into the hands of Roman Catholicism in the future. One day Antichrist will come, and the power of Roman Catholicism will be greatly expanded.</p>
<p>In the Bible, the first thing one has to do in dealing with his past is to reject all former idols. We must turn away from idols and wait for the coming of the Son of God. We should not even keep any picture of the Lord Jesus. Such pictures are not the real image of the Lord Jesus; they are worthless. In the museums in Rome, there are over two thousand different images of the Lord Jesus. All of them represent the imagination of the artists. In some countries artists often look for people who resemble their idea of Jesus and then pay them to pose for portraits of Jesus. This is blasphemous. Our God is a jealous God, and He will not tolerate such things among us. There should not be any kind of superstition. Some people like to say, &ldquo;It is not a good day today; there are bad omens.&rdquo; Such remarks are directly from hell. God&rsquo;s children should get rid of these ideas from the very first day and deal with them in a thorough way. They should not allow any flavor of idolatry to come in.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Improper Objects Needing to Be Terminated</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver&rdquo; (Acts 19:19). This is another matter which new believers should deal with and terminate.</p>
<p>This is not a command or a teaching; it is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit moved in such a strong way that the Ephesians brought out all the improper books in their possession. Here it says the price was &ldquo;fifty thousand pieces of silver,&rdquo; which is a considerable sum. They did not sell their books and give the money to the church. Instead, the books were burned. If Judas had been present, he certainly would not have allowed this. This was much more than thirty pieces of silver which could have been given to the poor. But the Lord was pleased to have them burned.</p>
<p>Apart from the kind of objects mentioned above, there are many other questionable objects that need to be dealt with. Some of them are clearly related to sins. Gambling instruments and improper books and pictures are some examples. These must be burned or destroyed. There may be many luxury items and objects of indulgence which cannot be burned. However, they still need to be removed. Burning, however, is the general principle in dealing with these things.</p>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, he should go home and check through his personal belongings. In an unbeliever&rsquo;s home, there is always something related to sin. He may have things which do not befit the saints. Things related to sin must be burned or destroyed; they cannot be sold. Luxury items should be converted and altered if possible. If they cannot be altered, we must sell them.</p>
<p>The garments of the lepers in Leviticus 13 and 14 are a good illustration. Garments which have become leprous and cannot be washed must be burned. However, those which can be washed should be washed for reuse. If the style of our clothes is unbecoming, we can alter them. Some garments may be too short, and we can lengthen them; others are odd-looking, and we can make them look more inconspicuous. Some objects cannot be salvaged; they have the element of sin in them, in which case we have to burn them. Those that can be sold should be sold, and the money should be given to the poor.</p>
<p>There should be a termination of improper things. If every new believer will go through all his belongings thoroughly, he will have a very good start. Superstitious objects have to be burned. Others can be altered or sold after being altered. Once we learn this lesson, we will not forget it for the rest of our lives. We must realize that being a Christian is a very practical matter; it is not just a matter of going to &ldquo;church&rdquo; and listening to some sermons.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Repaying Debts</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much&rdquo; (Luke 19:8). Zaccheus did not do this as a result of doctrinal teaching; he did this as a result of the working of the Holy Spirit. If it had been the result of doctrinal teaching, only the exact amount would have been repaid, no more and no less. But since it was the working of the Holy Spirit, the amount could vary; it could be a little more or a little less. Zaccheus said, &ldquo;If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.&rdquo; Actually, a double compensation would have been more than adequate. The principle in the book of Leviticus is to add one-fifth to the original amount. For one thousand dollars, you would have to repay one thousand two hundred dollars. But if one is touched, he can pay as much as the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit directs him to pay. He can be moved to repay four times or ten times as much. What is spoken of here is only a principle. In reading the Bible, we must be clear that what is covered is not a mere teaching. It is the result of the leading of the Holy Spirit when He operates in man.</p>
<p>Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means. Now that the Lord is working within, you have to deal with these things in a proper manner. This has nothing to do with the forgiveness you received from the Lord, but it is very much related to your testimony.</p>
<p>Suppose I stole a thousand dollars from someone before I was saved. If I have not dealt with the matter clearly, how can I preach the gospel to that person after I am saved? While I am preaching to him, his heart may still be on the thousand dollars. No doubt, I have received forgiveness from God, but I do not have a proper testimony before man. I cannot say, &ldquo;Since God has forgiven me, it does not matter whether or not I repay him.&rdquo; No, this matter is related to my testimony.</p>
<p>Please remember that Zaccheus restored four times as much for the sake of his testimony. At that time everyone was saying, &ldquo;How could the Lord lodge in this sinner&rsquo;s home? He has extorted and defrauded many people!&rdquo; They were all indignant. While they were saying this, Zaccheus stood up and said, &ldquo;If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.&rdquo; This fourfold restoration was neither a requirement for becoming a son of Abraham nor a requirement for God&rsquo;s salvation coming to Zaccheus&rsquo;s house. This fourfold restoration was the <em>result</em> of God&rsquo;s salvation coming to Zaccheus&rsquo;s house and of his becoming a son of Abraham. Due to this act of restoration, Zaccheus had a testimony before man. This was the basis of his testimony.</p>
<p>I knew a brother who was not very upright in financial matters before he believed in the Lord. Many of his classmates were upper middle-class people. After he believed in the Lord, he became rather zealous in leading his classmates to the Lord. But he did not see much fruit. Although he earnestly preached the gospel to them, they said in their heart, &ldquo;What is this? What about all the money?&rdquo; His past had not been eradicated from them. This brother did not follow the example of Zaccheus. His sins were forgiven before God. All his problems were solved. But the matter concerning his money before his classmates was not resolved. He had to confess and make recompense for all his past wrongdoings before he could testify to others. The restoration of his testimony depended on the termination of his past.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned, Zaccheus did not become a son of Abraham by restoring four times as much. Neither did he gain salvation by restoring four times as much. Rather, he restored four times as much <em>because</em> he was a child of Abraham. He restored four times as much <em>because</em> he was saved. By restoring four times as much, he shut the mouths of others. They could no longer say anything. His fourfold restoration went far beyond what he owed, thus shutting the mouths of others and restoring his testimony.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, did you wrong anyone in any way before you became a believer? Do you owe anyone anything? Have you taken things home which belong to others? Have you taken anything by improper means? If so, you have to deal with all these things properly. The repentance of a Christian has to do with confessing his past wrongdoings, whereas the repentance of ordinary men only involves a change in his present conduct. For example, as a human being, if I have a bad temper, I need only to refrain from my temper. But as a Christian, in addition to refraining from my temper, I have to apologize for my former temper. Apart from not losing my temper before God, I must also apologize for my former temper before men. Only then can this matter be terminated.</p>
<p>Suppose you stole from others in the past. Your problem before God is settled as long as you no longer steal. Likewise, if you have ever taken things that belonged to others, your problem is settled once you stop doing it. However, this is not enough for you to have a testimony before men. Even if you have not stolen anything in three years, others may still consider you as a thief. After believing in the Lord, you must testify before men; you must deal with all your mistakes in the past. Only then will your position be clear.</p>
<p>But here is a difficult problem. Suppose you stole ten thousand dollars from someone. What should you do if you do not even have one thousand dollars now? In principle you have to confess to the person from whom you have stolen. You should tell him frankly that you cannot repay him at the present time. Whether or not you can repay him immediately is another matter; you should still confess and testify to him. If you do not testify now, you will not be able to testify for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Please remember that in the course of giving your testimony, you may be affected by personal problems. But you cannot avoid dealing with these problems. You still must deal with the problems. You can have a testimony before men only after you have dealt with your problems.</p>
<p>Some have committed murder in the past. What should they do now? This is a part of their past. In the Bible there are two murderers who were saved. One was involved directly with the act of murder, while the other murdered indirectly. The first one was the robber on the cross. It is clear in the Greek language that the word <em>robber</em> does not just mean an ordinary robber; it means a criminal who engages in such acts as murder and arson. He was not just a thief but one who robbed and killed. After he believed in the Lord, his sins were forgiven. The Bible does not tell us how he terminated his past. The other person is Paul. He was not involved in any direct murder. However, he was an accomplice in the murder of Stephen, and he watched over the garments of those who killed Stephen. After Paul was saved, nothing was said about how he dealt with this matter.</p>
<p>In principle I believe that once a murderer has believed in the Lord, his sins are behind him. There is no sin which cannot be cleansed by the blood. The robber did not have to do anything to terminate his past. In fact, he had no opportunity to do anything. The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Today you shall be with Me in Paradise&rdquo; (Luke 23:43). Therefore, when we encounter such cases, we should not overly burden the conscience of others, unless of course God has first worked in that person&rsquo;s heart. This is because in the two New Testament cases that deal with murder&mdash;one directly and the other indirectly&mdash;God did not pay attention to the rectification of the past. However, I believe that some have no peace in their conscience, not because they are suffering from ordinary accusations, but because God is working in them. In such cases, we should not stop them from expressing their regrets to the victim&rsquo;s family.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Termination of Unsettled Matters</h2>
<p>When a person is saved, he surely has many unsettled secular matters at hand. These may easily hinder him from following the Lord. What should he do? &ldquo;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead&rdquo; (Matt. 8:22). This is another biblical case of terminating the past. Here, a man came to Jesus and said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father&rdquo; (v. 21). The Lord said, &ldquo;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo; The word <em>their</em> refers to the first use of the word <em>dead,</em> whereas the second <em>dead</em> refers to the man&rsquo;s father. The first <em>dead</em> refers to those who are spiritually dead. In God&rsquo;s eyes those in the world are spiritually dead. The Lord was saying that the man should let the dead bury his father, while he should follow the Lord.</p>
<p>I am not exhorting new believers to not make funeral arrangements for their fathers. I am saying that the dead should bury their own dead. We must lay hold of this principle. We should let go of unfinished business. If we wait until we have finished settling them before we become Christians, we will never have the time. There are hundreds and thousands of items of unfinished business in our families, with our fathers, and in our lives. Who then could become a Christian? There is only one word to describe the principle behind all of these things&mdash;these are dead people. Let the dead bury their dead. Let the spiritually dead handle the matters of the dead! This is the principle. This is not to exhort new believers to neglect their family. It means that they should not wait until they have settled all their earthly matters before coming to the Lord. If they do, they will not be able to follow the Lord.</p>
<p>Many people want to settle all of their affairs before they believe in the Lord. If so, they will have no opportunity to believe in Him. We should not be bound by matters of the dead. Instead, we should just regard the unsettled matters as settled. If we want to settle them before following the Lord, we will never make it. Matters concerning idols, improper things, and debts must be dealt with thoroughly. As for other unsettled matters, we should just let them go!</p>
<p>With regard to the attitude of a new believer towards his past, I can only find the above four categories of things in the Word of God. As for many other unsettled affairs, we should regard them as settled. As to family duties, we should let the dead take care of the dead. We have no time to deal with them. We want to follow the Lord. Those things are not for us to settle; they are for the dead to take care of. Let the ones who are spiritually dead handle them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A QUESTION</h2>
<p><em>A brother asked:</em> If I have offended a person and he is not aware of it, must I also confess to him?</p>
<p>Answer: It all depends on whether or not he has suffered material loss. If the other party is aware of this loss, you should deal with the matter by following Zaccheus&rsquo;s example. Even if he is unaware of this loss, you should still confess to him, especially when material loss is involved. It is best to bring the matter to the church and let the more experienced brothers help you solve it because they know what is most expedient.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">CONSECRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:1-2, 40-41; 29:1-25; Lev. 8:14-28; Rom. 6:13, 16, 19; 12:1; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; 2 Cor. 5:14-15</h1>
<p>Let us now turn to the matter of Christian consecration.</p>
<p>Whether or not a person consecrates himself depends on whether he has a healthy salvation experience. If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration. It is equally futile to talk about consecration to a person who feels that he is promoting the cause of Christianity and that his conversion is a great honor to it. Such a one does not have a good start in his Christian faith; he does not have a good beginning. It is impossible to expect him to consecrate himself. We must realize that it is the Lord who has graced us and granted mercy to us. It is the Lord who loves us and has saved us. This is why we consecrate our all to Him.</p>
<p>Teaching concerning consecration can be found in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Many passages in the New Testament, such as Romans 6 and 12, speak of consecration. In the Old Testament consecration is spoken of with special reference to Aaron and his household. Exodus 28 and 29 and Leviticus 8 speak of the consecration of Aaron and his household. Although consecration is the first basic experience of our service to God, we do not find many direct teachings from God&rsquo;s Word concerning it. In order to understand the meaning of consecration, we need to study the above referenced verses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 clearly shows us that the constraining power of the Lord&rsquo;s love is the basis for God&rsquo;s children to live unto Him who died for them and has been raised. A man lives unto the Lord because he is constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love. According to the original language, the word <em>constrained</em> can be translated &ldquo;pressed on from all sides,&rdquo; that is, tightly confined on all sides. It means to be tightly bound and wrapped up. Love has bound us up, and we cannot run away. When a person is in love, he will have a sense of bondage. We are bound by Him; we have no way out. He has died for us, and we should live unto Him today. Hence, love is the basis of consecration. A man consecrates himself to the Lord because of the Lord&rsquo;s love. No one can consecrate himself unless he first touches the Lord&rsquo;s love. A man must touch the Lord&rsquo;s love before he can consecrate himself to Him. When one touches the Lord&rsquo;s love, consecration spontaneously follows.</p>
<p>Consecration is based on the Lord&rsquo;s love. But it is also based on the Lord&rsquo;s right. This is the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 6:19-20: &ldquo;You are not your own...For you have been bought with a price.&rdquo; Our Lord gave His own life for us; He even became the ransom to purchase us back to Himself. We are those who are purchased by the Lord. Because the Lord has redeemed us, we willingly lose our own freedom for Him. We are no longer our own; we are the Lord&rsquo;s. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price. The blood which the Lord shed on the cross is the price He paid. Therefore, as far as the Lord&rsquo;s right is concerned, we belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>We must be clear that we are those purchased by the Lord. He has purchased us with the highest price. He bought us, not with silver or gold, but with His own blood. Here we see the Lord&rsquo;s love as well as His right. We serve the Lord because He loves us, and we follow Him because He has a right over us. The right secured through redemption constrains us to give ourselves to the Lord. The love that results from redemption also constrains us to give ourselves to Him. The basis of consecration is His right as well as His love. It is a legal right, and it is beyond all human sentimental love. These are the two reasons that we have to give ourselves to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Merely being constrained by love or acknowledging His legal right does not constitute consecration. After a person has been constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love and has acknowledged His right, there is a further step that he should take. This step will bring him on to a new position. Through the Lord&rsquo;s constraining and based on His purchase, we separate ourselves from every other thing. Henceforth, we live for and unto the Lord. This is consecration. In some instances in the Old Testament, the Chinese Union Version translates the word <em>consecration</em> as &ldquo;the receiving of the holy service.&rdquo; To receive the holy service is to receive the ministry of service to God. This is a holy service. This is consecration. Consecration is receiving the ministry of serving God. It is to say to the Lord, &ldquo;Today I will separate myself from everything to serve You, because You have loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. A CONSECRATED PERSON</h2>
<p>Let us look at Exodus 28:1-2 and 29:1, 4, 9-10.</p>
<p>After reading these verses, we can see that consecration is a very special matter. The nation of Israel was a nation chosen by God (Exo. 19:5-6), but it did not become a consecrated nation. There were twelve tribes among the Israelites, but not all the twelve tribes received the holy service. The tribe of Levi was one of the twelve tribes. They were a tribe chosen by God (Num. 3:11-13), but they were not a consecrated tribe. Among the many Levites, only the household of Aaron received the holy service. Not all of the Israelites received the holy service, not even all of the Levites. Only the household of Aaron received the holy service. In order to be consecrated, one had to belong to this household. If one were not a member of this household, he could not consecrate himself. Only the members of this household&mdash;the household of Aaron&mdash;were qualified to be priests, and only they could consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>Thank God, today we are the members of this household. Those who believe in the Lord are the members of this household. All who have been saved by grace are priests (Rev. 1:5-6). God has chosen us to be the priests. Initially, only the members of Aaron&rsquo;s household could consecrate themselves; if anyone else came near, he would have been put to death (Num. 18:7). We must remember that only those chosen by God to be priests can consecrate themselves. Thus, only the members of this household could consecrate themselves. Today God has chosen us to be the priests; therefore, we are the members of this household. Hence, we are qualified to consecrate ourselves.</p>
<p>Here we see that man does not consecrate himself because he has chosen God. Rather, God is the One who chooses and calls, and then man consecrates himself to Him. Those who consider that they are doing God a favor by forsaking all are but outsiders; they are not consecrated at all. We must realize that our service to God is not a favor or courtesy to God. It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God&rsquo;s work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work. It is God who has given us the glory and the beauty. The Bible tells us that the holy garment of the priest is for glory and beauty (Exo. 28:2). Consecration is God giving us glory and beauty; it is God calling us into His service. If we boast in anything at all, we must boast in our marvelous Lord. There is nothing marvelous for the Lord to have servants like us. The marvelous thing is for us to have such a Lord! We must see that consecration is the result of being chosen. Serving God is an honor to us. We are not uplifting God, as if we were sacrificing anything for Him or as if we had any glory in ourselves. Consecration is God giving us the glory. We should prostrate ourselves before Him and say, &ldquo;Thank You that I can have a part in Your service. There are so many people in this world, yet I am chosen to have a part in it!&rdquo; Consecration is our honor, not our sacrifice. It is true that we need to have the greatest sacrifice, but there is no sense of sacrifice in consecration. There is only the full sense of God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE WAY OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Leviticus 8:14-28 speaks of a bull, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread. The bull was for the sin offering; the first ram was for the burnt offering; and the second ram and the basket of unleavened bread were for the consecration offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Sin Offering</h2>
<p>In order to receive the holy service before God, that is, in order to consecrate oneself to God, the first thing that has to be taken care of is the propitiation for sin. Only a saved person, one who belongs to the Lord, can consecrate himself. The sin offering is the basis of consecration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Burnt Offering</h2>
<p>Following this, we see two rams. We need to study Leviticus 8:18-28 carefully. One ram was for the burnt offering; it was to be burned. The other was for the offering of consecration; it enabled Aaron to serve God.</p>
<p>What is a burnt offering? A burnt offering is an offering which is burned completely. The priest could not eat the flesh of the burnt offering. All the flesh of the burnt offering was burned completely. The problem of our sin is settled by the sin offering, but the burnt offering makes us acceptable to God. The Lord Jesus bore our sins on the cross. This refers to His work as the sin offering. At the same time, while the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the veil was rent from top to bottom, bringing us into the Holy of Holies. This is His work as the burnt offering. The sin offering and the burnt offering start at the same place, but they arrive at different destinations. They start where the sinner is. The sin offering stops at the propitiation of sin, but the burnt offering brings the sinner further by making him acceptable to God. The burnt offering is the offering which makes a sinner acceptable in the Beloved. It goes further than the sin offering. The burnt offering is the sweet savor of the Lord Jesus before God that secures God&rsquo;s acceptance of Him. Today when we offer Him to God, we are accepted by God as well. We are not only forgiven through the sin offering but also accepted through the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Offering of Consecration</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Sprinkling of the Blood</h2>
<p>After the first ram was slain, the second ram followed. What was done with the second ram after it was slain? The first thing that was done was the putting of blood upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the big toe of their right foot. This means that since God has accepted us in Christ, we should acknowledge the blood&rsquo;s separation of our ears, hands, and feet fully unto God. We should declare that our ears, hands, and feet are fully God&rsquo;s. Because of redemption, our ears, which were made for hearing, should now hear for God; our hands, which were made for working, should now work for God. Our legs, which were made for walking, should now walk for God. We apply the blood upon the tip of our right ear, the thumb of our right hand, and the big toe of our right foot. This means that our ears, hands, and feet have all been purchased by the Lord. We should say to the Lord, &ldquo;Because of Your redemption, Lord, from this day forward, I will no longer consider my two ears to be my own, or my two hands and my two feet to be my own. Because You have redeemed me, Lord, my entire being will henceforth belong to You; it is no longer mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blood is the mark of possession. It is also the symbol of love. Both the &ldquo;price&rdquo; spoken of in 1 Corinthians 6 and the &ldquo;love&rdquo; spoken of in 2 Corinthians 5 refer to this blood. Because there is blood, love, and possession, our entire being is not our own. The Lord has shed His blood, and we must acknowledge the rightful claim of this blood upon us. Because the Lord loves us, we will confess that our entire being belongs to Him alone.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Wave Offering</h2>
<p>After the sprinkling of the blood, there was the wave offering. We must remember that when the second ram was slain, its blood was put on the ear, the thumb, and the toe. This is still not consecration. It is just the basis of consecration. The sprinkling of the blood is merely a confession of love and of right. It qualifies us for consecration, but the actual consecration comes after this.</p>
<p>After the second ram was slain and its blood was sprinkled, the fat and the right shoulder (right thigh) were taken, and out of the basket, an unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer were also taken. All these things signify the two aspects of the Lord Jesus. The shoulder is the strong part, showing us the divine aspect of the Lord Jesus. Fat is rich, signifying the aspect of God&rsquo;s glory. Bread is of the vegetable life, showing us His highest humanity. He is the perfect man, who is unleavened and unblemished. He is full of the anointing oil, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Like a wafer, His nature, the sentiments in His heart, and His spiritual insight are fine, tender, and fragile, being full of feeling and compassion. All of these things were placed in the hands of Aaron, who took them and waved them before the Lord. After this they were burned with the burning of the burnt offering. This is consecration.</p>
<p>Here we need some explanation. The Hebrew word <em>consecration</em> means &ldquo;to have one&rsquo;s hands filled.&rdquo; Both Darby&rsquo;s translation and Young&rsquo;s concordance refer to this meaning. Initially the hands were empty, now they are filled. When Aaron&rsquo;s hands were filled with so many things, he was filled with the Lord and there was consecration. When Aaron&rsquo;s hands were empty, there was no consecration. When Aaron&rsquo;s hands were filled and his hands could no longer hold anything except the Lord, there was consecration.</p>
<p>What then is consecration? God demanded that the household of Aaron serve Him as priests. But Aaron could not come presumptuously. First, his sins had to be taken care of, and then he had to be accepted in Christ. His hands (denoting work) had to be full of Christ. He had to have nothing but Christ. Only then was there consecration. What is consecration? Simply put, consecration is, as Paul said, &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service&rdquo; (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>Before the Lord, we need to see that in this life there is only one way for us to take, that is, serving God. We have no other way. Serving God is our only way. In order to serve God, we have to present our entire bodies to Him. From this day forward, our ears will listen for the Lord, our hands will work for the Lord, and our feet will run for the Lord. Our two ears will only listen to the Lord&rsquo;s word, our two hands will only do the Lord&rsquo;s work, and our two feet will only walk the way of the Lord. We are here only to serve God. We have consecrated ourselves as an offering, a sacrifice; we have consecrated our all to Him. Furthermore, our two hands will be filled with Christ; they will uplift Him and express Him. This is what consecration is all about. Only when we have done this, will God say, &ldquo;This is consecration.&rdquo; This saturation of Christ is what God calls consecration.</p>
<p>Consecration means that we have touched the Lord&rsquo;s love and have recognized His right. For these reasons, we can come before God and beg for the privilege to serve. It is not just a matter of God&rsquo;s calling us but of our offering ourselves to serve. We should say, &ldquo;O God! I am Yours. I have been bought by You. In the past I was under Your table, hoping to eat a little of the fallen bread crumbs, but from this day forward, I want to serve You. Today I choose to serve You. I have been accepted in the Lord. May I also be granted a little portion in the great task of serving You? Be merciful to me so that I can have a part in Your service. In granting salvation to many, You did not pass me by or reject me; You saved me. Now give me a part among the many who serve You; do not reject me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how you present yourself to the Lord. Everything is for Christ and for Him alone. When you present yourself to Him in this way, you have consecration. This is what Romans 12 calls the presenting of our body. Romans 6 speaks of the consecration of the members. This is like the sprinkling of the blood on the ears, the hands, and the feet. Romans 12 speaks of the consecration of the whole body. It is the filling up of both hands with Christ. This links the Old Testament and the New Testament in a perfect way.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE GOAL OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>The goal of consecration is not to become a preacher for God or to work for Him. The goal of consecration is to serve Him. The result of consecration is service. In the original language the word <em>service</em> means &ldquo;to wait upon.&rdquo; This means that a person is prepared to serve. We must remember that the goal of consecration is to wait upon God. Waiting upon someone may not be strenuous work. To wait upon God means that you stand when He wants you to stand. If He wants to shuffle you aside, you allow Him to shuffle you aside, and if He wants you to run, you run. This is what it means to wait on Him.</p>
<p>God requires that all Christians offer up their bodies to wait on Him. This does not necessarily mean that He wants you to stand at the pulpit or evangelize some remote land. It means to wait on God. If God sends someone to the pulpit, that person has no choice but to speak. If God sends someone to remote lands, he has no choice but to go. All our time is for God, but the work that we do is flexible. Everyone should wait on God, but the specific work that one should engage in is flexible. We must learn to wait on God. The presenting of one&rsquo;s body is for serving God.</p>
<p>As long as we are Christians, we have to serve God all our lives. As soon as a person consecrates himself, he must realize that from that point on, the Lord&rsquo;s requirement comes first. Service to God becomes one&rsquo;s lifelong mission. May God be gracious to us and show us that our service to Him is our rightful duty. We should show every believer that henceforth we are those who serve the Lord. We must realize that as Christians, we can no longer be loose in anything. I am not saying that we should not be faithful and committed to our career or that we can be idle. This is not what I mean. We still need to be faithful and serious in our vocation. But before God we must see that our entire life is directed towards our service to God. We do everything for the purpose of obeying God&rsquo;s will and pleasing Him. This is the reality of consecration.</p>
<p>Consecration is not how much we can give to God. It is being accepted by God and being granted the honor of serving Him. Consecration is reserved for Christians alone; it is not for everyone. Only the saved ones, those who belong to the Lord, can consecrate themselves. Consecration means that we say, &ldquo;Lord, You have given me the opportunity and the right to come before You and to serve You.&rdquo; It is saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am Yours. My ears were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. My hands were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. My feet were purchased by the blood; they belong to You. From now on I can no longer use them for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not beg others to consecrate themselves. Instead, we tell them that a way is now available for them to consecrate themselves. There is a way to serve our God, the Lord of hosts. We must be clear that we are here to serve the Lord of hosts. It is grossly wrong to think that consecration is a matter of granting God a favor.</p>
<p>The revelation in the Old Testament is very clear. A man can only consecrate himself to God under His approval. The New Testament also exhorts us to consecrate ourselves through the compassions of God. God loves us so much; therefore, we have to consecrate ourselves. This is the most reasonable service. This is not a request for favor; this is the most reasonable thing, the most natural thing, to do. Consecration does not depend upon our willingness. It is because of God&rsquo;s abounding grace that we can consecrate ourselves. We must see that having the right to be God&rsquo;s servant is the greatest honor of our life. It is a joyful thing for a man to be saved. It is a far more joyful thing for a man to have a part in God&rsquo;s service! Who do we think our God is? We have to see His greatness and His glory. Only then will we see the tremendous significance and honor of this service! What a tremendous thing it is for us to receive His grace and be counted worthy of serving Him!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">CONFESSION WITH THE MOUTH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 10:10; Prov. 29:25; Matt. 10:32-33</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE<br />
OF CONFESSING WITH THE MOUTH</h2>
<p>Once a person has believed in the Lord, he should not keep the matter a secret; he has to confess the Lord with his mouth. Confessing the Lord with our mouth is a very important matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Opening the Mouth as Soon as One Believes</h2>
<p>As soon as one believes in the Lord, he should confess the Lord before men. Suppose a person gives birth to a child. What would we think if the child could not speak by the age of one or two, or even three? Would we say only that he is slow in speech development? Is it possible for such a person to begin saying, &ldquo;one, two, three, four,&rdquo; at the age of thirty and then learn to say &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; and &ldquo;mommy&rdquo; at fifty years of age? No. If a person is dumb in his infancy, he probably will be dumb for the rest of his life. If he cannot say &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; and &ldquo;mommy&rdquo; when he is young, he probably will not be able to say it for the rest of his life. Likewise, if a new believer does not confess the Lord immediately after he believes in the Lord, I am afraid he will be dumb for the rest of his life. If he cannot speak when he is young, he probably will not be able to speak when he grows up.</p>
<p>Some have been Christians for ten or even twenty years. Yet they remain dumb. This is because they did not open their mouth during the first and second week of their Christian life. They will continue to be dumb until they die. Confessing the Lord begins at the time a person believes. If you open your mouth the day you believe in the Lord, the way of confession will be opened to you. If a person is dumb in the first weeks, months, or year, he is likely to remain dumb for the rest of his life. Therefore, as soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should endeavor to speak to others about the Lord. Even if he finds it hard to speak and even if he dislikes speaking, he still must speak. He must speak to his relatives and friends. If he does not learn to speak openly, I am afraid he will be a dumb man before God for the rest of his life. We do not wish to see dumb believers. This is why we must learn to open our mouth from the very beginning. If a person fails to do this in the beginning, he will find it more difficult to do it later. Unless God grants special mercy or there is a revival, these ones will never open their mouth. It will take a great effort for them to open their mouth at a later date. Every new believer should seek the opportunity to confess the Lord before men. Such a confession is a great matter and reaps much profit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Confession with the Mouth unto Salvation</h2>
<p>Romans 10:10 says, &ldquo;For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&rdquo; &ldquo;With the heart there is believing unto righteousness.&rdquo; This is something before God. &ldquo;With the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&rdquo; This speaks of salvation before man. Whether or not you have believed is something before God; no one can see it. If you have sincerely believed, you are justified before God. However, if you only believe in your heart, but do not speak with your mouth, others will not recognize you as a saved person; they will still consider you an unbeliever. They will not see any difference between you and them. This is why the Bible strongly stresses the need to confess with the mouth in addition to believing in the heart. We must speak with our mouth.</p>
<p>Every new believer must look for opportunities to confess the Lord. Among our classmates, colleagues, friends, relatives, and all those who come into contact with us, as soon as an opportunity arises, we should say to them, &ldquo;I have believed in the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; The sooner we open our mouth, the better it is. Once we open our mouth, others will immediately know that we have believed in the Lord Jesus. In this way, we will be delivered from the company of unbelievers.</p>
<p>We have seen some people who hesitated in their acceptance of the Lord, but once they stood up and proclaimed, &ldquo;I believe in Jesus,&rdquo; they became sure. The worst thing that can happen to a Christian is for him to keep his mouth shut. Once he speaks, he takes a firm step forward and becomes secure. Many believers hesitate initially, but as soon as they say, &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; they become certain.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Confession Saving Much Trouble</h2>
<p>There is great profit when one confesses with his mouth after he has believed in his heart. It saves him much trouble in the future.</p>
<p>Suppose you do not open your mouth and say, &ldquo;I have decided to follow the Lord Jesus; I am His now.&rdquo; Others will still consider you the same as they. When they sin or indulge in lustful things, they will consider you to be one of them. In your heart you realize that you are a Christian and that it is wrong for you to be among them. But you cannot reject them, because you want to please them. You may come up with an excuse to turn them down. But the next time they will still drag you along, and you will have to think of another excuse to refuse them. You may come up with excuses once or twice, but the pressure will always come back. So why not put the signboard out from the very first day and confess that you are a believer? You only need to confess once or twice, and others will give up trying to persuade you.</p>
<p>If you do not confess with your mouth, that is, if you are a Christian secretly, you will experience much more difficulty than those who are Christians openly. Your temptation will be many times greater than the temptation of those who openly confess the Lord. You will be bound by human affections and past relationships. You cannot excuse yourself from others every time by saying that you have a headache or that you are busy. You cannot use excuses every time. This is why you must declare from the first day, &ldquo;I have believed in the Lord Jesus. I have accepted Him.&rdquo; Once you put out this signboard, your colleagues, classmates, relatives, and family will know the kind of person you are. This will save you much trouble. Otherwise, you will have all kinds of frustrations. If a person confesses the Lord with his mouth, he will be saved from much trouble.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Confessing the Lord<br />
Leading to Accusations in the Conscience</h2>
<p>There is another serious problem for a person who does not confess the Lord with his mouth. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s believers experienced this when the Lord was on the earth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was rejected by the Jews. They vehemently opposed and rejected Him. In John 9 the Jews made a decision: Whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue (v. 22). In chapter twelve the Bible says that many Jewish rulers believed in the Lord Jesus secretly, but they dared not confess Him because they were afraid of being put out of the synagogue (v. 42). Do you think that these people had peace in their hearts? Perhaps they felt uneasy about confessing the Lord, but they felt even more uneasy about not confessing the Lord. What kind of place was the synagogue? It was a place where people opposed the Lord Jesus. They plotted, conspired, and discussed plans to trap the Lord there. Such were the dark things that went on in the synagogue. What should a genuine believer do among such people? How much strength would he need to keep his mouth shut? Under such circumstances it would be difficult for anyone to confess the Lord with his mouth, but it would be even harder for him to not confess the Lord with his mouth.</p>
<p>The Jewish synagogue is a picture of the world&rsquo;s opposition to the Lord. The world always criticizes the Lord Jesus. It always considers Jesus of Nazareth a problem. It has all kinds of things to say against our Lord. In a place like this, can you listen to the people and pretend to be like one of them? To pretend is painful; to pretend is also difficult. You have to muster enough strength to control and repress yourself before you can pretend. Under such circumstances, is it not true that something within you will want to cry out, &ldquo;This man is the Son of God; I believe in Him&rdquo;? Is there not something within you that wants to proclaim, &ldquo;This man is my Savior, and I have already believed in Him,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;This man can deliver me from my sins. You may not believe in Him, but I do&rdquo;? Is there not something within you that wants to make such a declaration?</p>
<p>Are you going to force yourself to be quiet just because you want man&rsquo;s respect and position? It seems to me it would have been easier for the Jewish rulers in John 12 to simply be put out of the synagogue. They would have felt much better if they had confessed the Lord. If you are a false believer, it probably will make no difference whether or not you confess. But as a genuine believer, you will surely offend your conscience if you pretend and sympathize with the Lord&rsquo;s opposers. When others oppose the Lord, you have no peace in your heart, yet you must force yourself to say, &ldquo;What you are saying is interesting.&rdquo; Is this not the most painful thing to do as a human being?</p>
<p>There is nothing more painful than not confessing the Lord. The greatest suffering is to refuse to confess the Lord before men. I would not want to trade places with those rulers. Their suffering was too great! If you are not a believer, there is nothing to say. But if you have believed, the easier and more joyful and happy thing to do is come out of the synagogue. You may feel that there are many obstacles, but past experience indicates that the obstacles will be greater and your heart will suffer more if you do not go this way.</p>
<p>Suppose you hear someone maliciously slander your parents, saying this and that about them. Suppose that you try to sit still and listen to them or, worse still, pretend to sympathize with them. If you do this, I would wonder what kind of a person you were. Our Lord has given His life to save us. If we do not say something for the very Lord whom we worship and serve, how much more timid are we? We must be bold to stand up and proclaim for the Lord, &ldquo;I belong to Him!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">II. COMMON MISTAKES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Replacing Confession with Good Behavior</h2>
<p>Some new believers are influenced by traditional teachings. They think that having good behavior is the most important thing for a Christian and that confession with the mouth is not that crucial. They think that a change in what one says is not important, but that a change in what one does is important. We must correct this wrong concept. We are not saying that it is not necessary to change our conduct. If one&rsquo;s conduct is not changed, it is useless to confess with the mouth. But changing what one does without confessing with one&rsquo;s mouth is equally futile. A change in conduct can never take the place of confession with the mouth. After one&rsquo;s conduct is changed, his mouth still has to confess.</p>
<p>Every new believer must seize the earliest opportunity to tell others about his faith in the Lord Jesus. If you do not confess with your mouth, others will make many conjectures about you. They will try to explain your behavior with speculation. They will say all kinds of things about you, but they will not touch the Lord Jesus. Therefore, you must tell them the reason for the change in your conduct. No good conduct can take the place of verbal confession. It is necessary to have good conduct, but it is equally necessary to confess with the mouth. You must tell others, &ldquo;Jesus is my Lord; I want to serve Him.&rdquo; No matter how good your conduct is, these words must come out of your mouth.</p>
<p>We have heard people say that if they have good outward conduct, there is no need for them to say anything with their mouth. Please remember that no one will bother to criticize those who say this if they fail slightly in their personal conduct. But if a man stands up to proclaim that he is a Christian, others will immediately criticize and rebuke him when there is any slip in his conduct. Hence, those who say that good conduct is enough and that there is no need to confess with the mouth are in reality giving themselves an excuse to fail in their conduct. They are leaving a back door for themselves to escape from the judgment of others. Never believe that just a change in conduct is sufficient. Confession with the mouth is needed; in fact, it is absolutely indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Afraid of Failing to Persevere to the End</h2>
<p>Some people think, &ldquo;If I confess with my mouth and then fail to persevere in my Christian conviction, will this not become a joke to others? Suppose I can no longer make it as a Christian after three or five years, what should I do then? It is better for me not to say anything now. Let me wait for several years, until I find out whether or not I can make it.&rdquo; We can tell such ones that if they do not confess because they are afraid of stumbling or failing, they will surely fail. They have already opened a back door and are trying to avoid the front door. They have already made preparations to back out of their own confession. They want to wait to have assurance before they confess. We are sure that such ones will fail. It is better to stand up and say, &ldquo;I am for the Lord.&rdquo; If you close the back door first, it will become much harder for you to back out or backslide later. Consequently, you will have a much better chance of going forward than of sliding backward. In fact, this is the only possible way for you to go forward.</p>
<p>If you want to wait until you have good behavior before you confess, your mouth will never open up. You will always be dumb. Even after you have good conduct, you will still be dumb. If you do not open your mouth at the beginning, it will be much harder to open your mouth later. If you open your mouth, the chance of having good conduct will be greater. If you want to wait until your behavior is good before you confess, you will lose both your chance of opening your mouth as well as your chance of having good behavior; both will be lost, and you will fail in both.</p>
<p>One assuring thought is that God is not only the God who redeems us but also the God who preserves us. What should we liken redemption to? Redemption is like buying something. What then is preservation? Preservation is like putting the purchased object in one&rsquo;s own hand. How many people in this world buy things with the view of throwing them away? When we buy a watch, we want to use it for five or ten years; no one buys a watch with the view of throwing it away. God is saving people everywhere. He does not save them and then throw them away. He wants to preserve what He has saved. Since God has saved us, He will preserve us. Since God has redeemed us, He will preserve us until that day. God loves us so much that He was willing to forsake His Son to redeem us. If He had no intention of preserving us, He would not have paid such a great price. It is God&rsquo;s purpose as well as His plan to preserve us. Do not be afraid to stand up and say, &ldquo;I believe in the Lord.&rdquo; You may say, &ldquo;What happens if I fail in a few days?&rdquo; Do not worry about this; God will be responsible for it. It is better for you to stand up and say, &ldquo;I belong to God.&rdquo; Commit yourself to God. God knows that you need support, comfort, and protection. We have the assurance to say that God preserves man&rsquo;s salvation. This preservation makes redemption meaningful.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Fear of Men</h2>
<p>Some people dare not confess because they are afraid of men. Many people can honestly say that they have no other reservation in their heart; they are willing to stand up and confess, but when they see the faces of others, they become afraid. When they look at their parents&rsquo; faces or their friends&rsquo; faces, they feel too shy to speak up. This is where many people are stumbled; they are afraid of men and do not have any boldness to open their mouth. Some people are naturally timid; they are timid not only in confessing the Lord but also in other things. If you want them to tell others about their faith, you are asking them for their life. They simply dare not open their mouth.</p>
<p>However, this kind of person needs to hear what God has to say. Proverbs 29:25 says, &ldquo;The fear of man bringeth a snare.&rdquo; If you are afraid when you see someone, you will fall into a &ldquo;snare.&rdquo; As soon as you become afraid, you fall into a snare. Your fear becomes your snare. Whenever your heart is afraid of men, you are creating a snare for yourself. Once you are afraid, you fall into a snare. This snare is created by your own fear. Actually, the person you fear may be very willing to listen to you. Even if he is not inclined to listen, he may not be as fearsome as you think.</p>
<p>There is a story about two persons who were colleagues. One was a believer and the other was not. The one who believed was very timid; the one who did not believe was also very timid. The timid believer did not dare tell his colleague that he was saved. The one who did not believe was puzzled by the great changes that were happening to his colleague. His colleague used to have a quick temper but had now changed. He dared not ask his colleague the reason. The two of them shared a table and sat face-to-face every day. One was too timid to speak, and the other was too timid to ask. Every day they just looked at each other. One was afraid to speak, and the other was afraid to ask. One day the believer could not hold back any longer. After praying about it, he went to the other one and shook his hand tightly and said, &ldquo;I am a very timid person. For at least three months I have been struggling to tell you something. Now I am going to tell you. I have believed in Jesus.&rdquo; After saying these words, his face turned pale. The other one said, &ldquo;I too have waited for three months. I wanted to ask why you have become so different, but I was too afraid to ask.&rdquo; The believer mustered enough courage to open his mouth. From that time on, the opportunity opened up, and he was able to bring his friend to the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are fearful of men will fall into a snare. Please remember that while you are afraid of others, others may be afraid of you too. We must never have a fear of men. We who follow God should not fear men. If you have a fear of men, you cannot be a good Christian and you cannot serve God. A Christian must be bold to speak to his relatives and friends. He must be bold to confess the Lord both in private and in public. We must take this way from the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Shy</h2>
<p>Some people are shy. They feel that it is a shameful thing to be a Christian. It is true that this kind of shame may exist when we face unbelievers. If you tell others that you are engaged in technical research, they will congratulate you for having a good future. If you say that you are studying a certain philosophy, others will also say that you are a thoughtful person. You are not ashamed to talk about doing many things. But if you say that you are a Christian, many will say that you are too simple-minded or not intellectual enough. They will not esteem you highly. You are not ashamed to talk about other things, but as soon as you confess your Christian faith, you feel ashamed within. It is unavoidable for a new believer to feel shameful when he opens his mouth to confess his faith. However, we must overcome this feeling. It is true that the world feels shameful about someone becoming a Christian, but we must overcome this feeling.</p>
<p>How can we overcome this feeling of shame? We must deal with it from two aspects:</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have to realize that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He bore our sins as well as our shame. When our Lord bore our sins, He suffered great humiliation. Today, in the eyes of God, it is only proper that we suffer humiliation from men. The humiliation we suffer before man can never be compared with the humiliation our Lord suffered on the cross for us. Therefore, we should not be surprised at humiliation. We should know that we belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a good hymn which says, &ldquo;Our shyness is like the early morning sky disowning the sun! But the Lord radiates the divine light which illuminates our consciences which are as dark as the night.&rdquo; Since the Lord has been gracious to us and has redeemed us, being ashamed of confessing Him is like the early morning sky being ashamed of the illumination of the sun. Today the Lord has graced us. He has redeemed us and preserved us. He will even bring us to the heavens. Yet we consider it a shame to confess Him! If that is a shame, then all the grace we have received should also be considered a shame to us, and we should deny it all! The Lord has done so much for us, and yet we feel ashamed of confessing Him! How can this be?</p>
<p>We should feel shameful for such things as carousing, drunkenness, unrestrained dissipation, works of darkness, sinning, and evil works. The Lord has delivered us from all these. We should feel glorious. How can we have a sense of shame? It is not shameful for us to confess the Lord; it is glorious and joyous for us to confess Him! We are those who will never perish, who will never be condemned or judged by God, and who will never have to depart from the glorious face of God. We are those who follow the Lamb and who will always be with Him (Rev. 14:4). It is altogether wrong for others to plant the seed of shame in us. We should stand up boldly and say that we belong to God. We should rejoice and glory in Him.</p>
<p>By nature Peter was a strong-willed person. He wanted to distinguish himself among the disciples and to be ahead of others in everything. But one day he denied the Lord and became like a little mouse. When he was questioned, he was afraid. Humanly speaking, Peter was a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; and a born leader among the disciples. Yet he trembled even before others tried to take his life. He trembled and swore when all that was said to him was, &ldquo;This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo; This was indeed too poor. All those who refuse to confess the Lord are poor. Peter was most shameful; it was a shame for him to deny the Lord (Matt. 26:69-75).</p>
<p>All those who are too shy to open their mouths are full of shame. The really noble ones are the ones who confess their allegiance to Jesus of Nazareth, even at the point of being burned at the stake or thrown into the sea. They may be beaten, burned alive, or thrown into the lions&rsquo; den, but they still proclaim, &ldquo;I belong to Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo; This is the most glorious thing in the whole world. The most shameful ones are those who are ashamed to confess the Lord. This kind of people are useless. They will even loathe themselves and be ashamed of themselves! The most shameful thing is for a person to despise himself and be ashamed of what he has.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not have any fear or shame. All those who learn to follow the Lord should learn to confess Him boldly before man. If light is shameful and darkness glorious, if holiness is shameful and sin glorious, if spirituality is shameful and carnality glorious, and if following the Lord is shameful and following man glorious, then we would rather choose shame. We would rather suffer humiliation with Christ as Moses did, which humiliation is far better than the glories of men (Heb. 11:26).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Love of Man&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>Why did the rulers in John 12 not confess the Lord? They did not confess the Lord because they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. Many people dare not confess because they want both; they want Christ, and they also want the synagogue. They want Christ; this is why they believe. But they also want the synagogue; this is why they will not confess Him. If a person wants both, he will not be absolute in either.</p>
<p>If you want to serve the Lord, you must make a choice between the Lord and the synagogue. Otherwise, you can never be a good Christian. You must make a choice between the Lord and man. The rulers were afraid of losing men&rsquo;s favor. They were afraid that if they confessed the Lord they would be put out of the synagogue. But a person who chooses the Lord in an absolute way will not be afraid of being put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p>If people do not persecute you after you have believed in the Lord, you should say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You.&rdquo; If people persecute you after you have confessed the Lord with your mouth, you should also say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You.&rdquo; What is so strange about this? We cannot be like those rulers who, for the sake of their love for the synagogue, refused to confess their faith in the Lord Jesus. If everyone in the church had been like them, there would be no church on earth today. If Peter had returned home and remained silent after he believed in the Lord, if Paul, Luke, Darby, and the rest had remained silent after they believed, and if everyone in the church had remained silent and dared not confess the Lord, their troubles definitely would have been less, but there would be no church on earth today!</p>
<p>One characteristic of the church is that it dares to believe in the Lord. Another characteristic is that it dares to confess its faith in Him. To be saved is not just to believe in the Lord Jesus; it is to believe and to confess that one is a believer. The confession is important. Christianity is not only manifested in one&rsquo;s conduct but also in one&rsquo;s mouth. The mouth must confess. One must confess, &ldquo;I am a Christian.&rdquo; It is not enough for a Christian to just have good conduct; he must also confess with his mouth. If you take away the mouth, there will be no Christianity. The Scripture is very clear. The heart believes unto righteousness and the mouth confesses unto salvation. Christianity is believing in the heart and confessing with the mouth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CONFESSING THE LORD<br />
AND THE LORD&rsquo;S CONFESSION</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 10:32). Thank the Lord that if we confess the Lord today, on that day He will also confess us. The Lord also said, &ldquo;But whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 33). &ldquo;But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God&rdquo; (Luke 12:9). What a great contrast! All we have to do is confess that this excellent One, this chiefest among ten thousand, is the Son of God. He will then confess us before the heavenly Father and the angels of God. If you think it is difficult to confess such a Lord before men, the Lord will find it difficult to confess such a person as you when He descends in the glory of the Father. Today we must not shrink back from confessing the Lord through fear of men (Isa. 51:12). If today we find it difficult to confess Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, then on that day, when our Lord comes back, He will find it difficult to confess us before His Father and all the glorious angels. What a serious thing this is!</p>
<p>In reality, it is not difficult for us to confess the Lord. It is especially easy when we compare our confession with His confession of us. It is difficult for Him to confess us because we are prodigal sons who have come home, and there is nothing good in us. Since He will confess us in the future, let us also confess Him well before men today.</p>
<p>May all the newly-saved brothers and sisters be bold to confess the Lord from the beginning. We should never try to be Christians in secret.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 10:8-11, 21-26; 12:6-11, 37-42; 2 Cor. 6:17</h1>
<p>There are many commandments in the Bible concerning separation from the world. The Old Testament contains many examples and teachings concerning this. For example, Egypt, Ur of the Chaldees, Babylon, and Sodom are all types of the world. They show different aspects of the world. Egypt represents the joy of the world, Ur of the Chaldees represents the religions of the world, the tower of Babel represents the confusion of the world, and Sodom represents the sins of the world. A man should come out of Egypt and also out of Ur of the Chaldees, just as Abraham did. Lot went to Sodom, and the people of Israel fell into captivity in Babylon. All should come out from these places. The Bible uses four different places to represent the world and shows how God&rsquo;s people come out from these different aspects of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TYPE OF ISRAEL&rsquo;S EXODUS FROM EGYPT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Result of Redemption Being to Go Out</h2>
<p>God saved the Israelites through the Passover lamb. When the messenger of God went forth to kill the firstborn in the land of Egypt, the angel of death passed over the doors which had the blood upon them. If there was no blood on the door, the firstborn of that house was killed. It had nothing to do with whether the door was good or bad, whether there was anything special about the lintel or the side posts, whether there was anything good about that family, or whether the firstborn child honored his parents. The issue was whether there was any blood. Whether or not you will perish does not depend on your family&rsquo;s status or your behavior; it depends on whether you have the blood. The basic factor for salvation is the blood; this has nothing to do with us.</p>
<p>We who are saved by grace are redeemed by the blood. But please remember that immediately after being redeemed by the blood, we must move and go out. Do not think that we can buy a house and dwell in Egypt after we are redeemed by the blood. Those who are redeemed by the blood must set out that very night. The lamb was slaughtered before midnight, and the blood was sprinkled with hyssop. They ate their meal quickly, with their loins girded and their staff in their hands, because they had to leave immediately.</p>
<p>The first result of redemption is separation, that is, departure, a going out. God never redeems a person and leaves him in the old position to continue living in the world. There is absolutely no such thing. Once a person is born again, saved, he must take up his staff and set out. Once the angel of destruction has done his work of separating the saved from the perishing, the saved ones must leave. Once you have been separated by the smiting angel, you have to pack up and move out of Egypt.</p>
<p>A staff is for walking. No one holds a staff to lie down in bed. The staff is not a pillow; it is for walking. All those who are redeemed, old or young, must take their staff and leave the same night. As soon as you are redeemed by the blood, you become a sojourner and a pilgrim on the earth; you have to go out of Egypt and be separated from the world immediately. You must not continue to live there.</p>
<p>There was a sister who taught a class in a children&rsquo;s meeting. Once she was telling the story of Lazarus and the rich man. She asked the children, &ldquo;Do you want to be Lazarus or the rich man? The rich man enjoys himself in this age and suffers in the next. Lazarus suffers today and enjoys himself later. Which would you choose to be?&rdquo; An eight-year-old girl stood up and said, &ldquo;While I am alive, I want to be the rich man, but when I die, I want to be Lazarus.&rdquo; Many people are like this. When they need salvation, they trust in the blood of the Lamb; but after they are saved by the blood, they settle down firmly in Egypt. They think that they can have the best of both sides.</p>
<p>Please remember that the blood&rsquo;s redemption saves you from the world. Once you are redeemed by the blood, you immediately become a sojourner, a pilgrim in this world. This does not mean that you no longer live on the earth. It means that you are immediately separated from the world. Wherever redemption is applied, this is the result. As soon as a man is redeemed, his course is changed, and he has to leave the world. The separation of the blood separates the living from the dead; it also separates the children of God from the people of the world. Once we are redeemed, we can no longer remain in the world.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Many Frustrations from Pharaoh</h2>
<p>The story of Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt shows us how difficult it was for them to leave Egypt! Egypt tried to hold them back again and again. When the Israelites first wanted to leave Egypt, Pharaoh only allowed the strong men to go; the young and the old had to stay back. Pharaoh knew that if he could hold back the young and the old the strong men would not go far. After a while they would come back. Satan&rsquo;s strategy is to prevent us from having a thorough separation from Egypt. From the very beginning, Moses rejected Pharaoh&rsquo;s delays. If we leave one thing or one person behind, we cannot go too far; eventually we will turn back.</p>
<p>You may recall what Pharaoh told Moses the first time: &ldquo;Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land&rdquo; (Exo. 8:25). Later, he told him not to go too far. The third time he told him that only the strong ones could go. The fourth time, he told him that all the people could go but the cattle and the sheep had to remain. Pharaoh&rsquo;s way was to persuade them to serve God there in Egypt. This was his basic premise. He was willing to allow a person to be God&rsquo;s child as long as such a one remained in Egypt. He knew that if a person served God in Egypt, he would not have a testimony and he would have to serve Pharaoh in the end. Even though one wanted to be God&rsquo;s servant, he would eventually end up being Satan&rsquo;s servant.</p>
<p>If you try to serve God in the world, you will surely end up being Satan&rsquo;s slave. You will have to make bricks for him, and he will not let you go. Even if he does, he will not let you go too far. If he lets you go, he may only allow the strong men to go; the rest will have to stay. Satan is quite familiar with the words in Matthew 6:21: &ldquo;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo; The treasure and the person go together. He knew that if Pharaoh held back the cattle and the sheep, the people would not go too far. The people eventually would follow the cattle and the sheep. But God wanted the cattle and the sheep to follow the people. He wanted the people to be saved from the treasure.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, he must go out to the wilderness. Moreover, he has to bring all the people and all his treasures with him. Otherwise, he will eventually go back to Egypt, and there will be no separation from Egypt. God&rsquo;s commandment is that those who serve Him must separate themselves from the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Our Way Being in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Just to confess the Lord with our mouth and say, &ldquo;I have believed in the Lord today,&rdquo; is not enough for a testimony. We must come out from the world and be separated. This takes us one step further than confessing Jesus as Lord with our mouth. We cannot be dumb Christians. However, opening up our mouth alone is not enough; we must be separated from the world. We cannot continue our previous friendships, social ties, or other previous relationships. We must treasure our present position in the Lord and turn far away from our previous position. The person has to go out, and the possessions have to go out as well. Others may say that we are foolish, but we should not listen to them. Today we have to come out from Egypt. From the time we become a Christian, our way is that of the wilderness, not of Egypt.</p>
<p>In New Testament terms, both Egypt and the wilderness represent the world. Egypt refers to the world in its moral sense. The wilderness refers to the world in its physical sense. Christians are in the physical world but not in the moral world. We must see that there are two aspects of the world: the first as a place and the second as a system. There are many things related to the physical world which are attractive, which arouse the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, and the vainglory of life. This is Egypt. But there is another meaning to the world&mdash;the physical world as a place where one&rsquo;s body resides.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Leaving the Moral World</h2>
<p>Today we Christians must come out of the system and the organization of the world. Leaving the world refers to our deliverance from the moral world, not the physical world. We need to leave the moral world behind, not the physical world. In other words, we are still living in the world, but this world has become a wilderness to us.</p>
<p>What is the world to us? Mr. D. M. Panton put it well when he said, &ldquo;While I am living, it is a journey to me; when I die, it is a tomb to me.&rdquo; While a believer is living on this earth, the world is a journey to him; when he dies, the world is only a tomb in which he is buried. We must be separated from the people of the world. Every believer must be separated from the world. In the eyes of the world, we are in the wilderness; we are pilgrims. They are the ones who are in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Sojourners and Pilgrims in this World</h2>
<p>We must realize that we are sojourners and pilgrims in this world. As far as the moral world is concerned, we have come out of it. It wants to keep us, but if we stay, we will not be able to serve God. The world wants to be closer to us, but if we allow it to come too close to us, it will be impossible for us to serve God. The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God.</p>
<p>We have been separated from Egypt, and our faces are toward the promised land. The basis of that separation is the blood, the blood that has bought us back. The Egyptians have not been bought by the blood; the worldly ones have not been redeemed. As redeemed ones, we have been transferred to another world. Therefore, we must leave this world.</p>
<p>Suppose you go to a watch shop to buy a watch. What do you do after you have bought it? Once the purchase has been made, you take the watch away. I should not buy the watch and leave it behind. I should not tell the proprietor, &ldquo;Here, you use it!&rdquo; This is not reasonable. Buying means taking away. Whenever there is a purchase, there is a taking away. If I buy a sack of rice, the rice is taken away from the shop. After one buys something, the purchased item is taken away. Please remember that since the blood has bought us, we must be taken away from the world. Once a person is bought by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, he should leave for the promised land. As soon as one is bought, he should leave. Those who are not bought can stay behind. But as soon as a person is bought, he should leave. Once a person is bought, he has no choice but to go with the Lord. If I have been bought by the Lord, I must leave the world and go with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. AREAS THAT REQUIRE SEPARATION<br />
FROM THE WORLD</h2>
<p>You may ask what we should separate ourselves from. What things are considered the world? What areas should we be separated from? Before we touch any specific item, we should realize that our heart and spirit are the first things that need separation from the world. If a person&rsquo;s heart is set towards the world, it becomes futile to speak to him about anything else. It is useless to try to be delivered from a hundred things if the person himself still remains in the world. First, there must be a deliverance of the person, a deliverance of the spirit, and a deliverance of the heart. Deliverance from matters comes later.</p>
<p>A man must be separated completely from Egypt; he must be separated from the world. He should not be afraid that others will criticize him as being peculiar. Then there is the need to take care of some principles. In some areas we should be separated from the world, while in other areas we should maintain peace with it. We have no intention to be contentious. In the family, in the office, and everywhere, we do not want to arouse controversy. Let us consider five specific things that need to be dealt with:</p><h2 class="head2">A. Things Which the World Considers<br />
Improper for Christians to Do</h2>
<p>We should refrain from anything that the world considers improper for Christians to do. Our Christian life at the minimum should meet the standard of the worldly people. Everyone in the world has set up a yardstick and a standard for Christians. If you do not meet this standard, you have failed them. When you do something, you should not give the Gentiles any ground to ask, &ldquo;Do Christians do this?&rdquo; If others say this, you are finished. As soon as you are rebuked, you are finished. Suppose you are caught visiting certain places. The Gentiles may say, &ldquo;Do Christians come to places such as this?&rdquo; There are many places Gentiles like to visit. If you tell them that it is wrong to visit those places, they may insist and argue with you. But if you visit those places yourself, they will ask, &ldquo;How can you also go to these places?&rdquo; Some matters are sinful. When the Gentiles do them, they keep quiet about it. But if you do the same things, they will speak up. Therefore, we must refrain from things that the Gentiles consider improper. This is a minimum requirement. When a Gentile says, &ldquo;Christians should not do such a thing,&rdquo; we should turn away from it immediately.</p>
<p>Some young people are saved, but their parents are still unsaved. Sometimes these children ask for something from the parents. The parents may say, &ldquo;Do you Christians want these things as well?&rdquo; It is most shameful for a Christian to find himself adjusted by the Gentiles. Abraham lied and was rebuked by Abimelech. This is a most shameful thing in the Bible. We must refrain from things that are considered improper by the Gentiles. We must stay away from things that the worldly people, the Egyptians, consider inappropriate for Christians to do. We must be separated from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Things Incompatible with the Lord</h2>
<p>Anything that is incompatible with the Lord must also be removed. Since the Lord suffered humiliation on the earth, we should not seek glory here. Since the Lord was crucified like a robber, we should not seek to be welcomed everywhere. When our Lord was walking on the earth, He was accused of demon possession. We cannot allow people to say that we have the best mind, that we are smart, or that we are very intellectual. We have to pass through what the Lord passed through. Everything that is incompatible with the Lord must go.</p>
<p>The Lord said that a slave is not greater than his master and a disciple is not greater than his teacher. If the world treated our Master one way, we should not expect it to treat us another way. If it treated our Teacher one way, we should not expect it to treat us another way. If we are not treated the same as our Master, something is wrong with us, and something is definitely wrong in our relationship with the Lord. Whatever our Lord experienced on the earth should be our experience today.</p>
<p>To follow Jesus of Nazareth, one must be ready to suffer humiliation; this is not a thing of glory. To follow Jesus of Nazareth means to bear the cross. When others first came to the Lord, the Lord told them that they had to bear the cross in order to follow Him. According to the Lord, this is the main entrance. He does not wait until a person is in the room before He tells him this condition. Before we go in, the Lord makes it clear that we must bear the cross in order to follow Him. The Lord has called us to bear the cross. This is the way we are taking, and we can only follow the Lord according to this way. The Lord&rsquo;s relationship with the world should be our relationship with the world. Our relationship with the world must be compatible with our Lord&rsquo;s relationship with the world; we cannot take a different way.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:14 shows us that the cross stands between the world and the Lord. The Lord is on one side, and the world is on the other side. The cross stands in between. We and the world stand on opposite sides of the cross. The world crucified our Lord on the cross; therefore, the world is on the other side of the cross. Since I am on the Lord&rsquo;s side, I would have to go through the cross before I could reach the world. There is no way to go around the cross because the cross is a fact; it is also history. I cannot annul this fact, and I cannot annul history. The world has crucified our Lord. I cannot take another way. If the cross is a fact, the crucifixion of the world to me is also an eternal fact. If I cannot annul the cross, I also cannot annul the fact that the world has been crucified to me. Today there is no way for me to go to the world&rsquo;s side, unless I remove the cross. The cross is here, and I have no way to avoid it because the crucifixion of my Lord is a fact. Today, I am a person on the other side of the cross.</p>
<p>Suppose a person&rsquo;s parents or brothers are killed. Others may offer a reasonable excuse for the murderer, but the person may say, &ldquo;My folks are already dead. An excuse cannot change this fact. If my folks were not yet dead, there would be something to talk about. But now that they are dead, there is nothing more to say.&rdquo; In the same principle, we can say that the cross is already here; what more is there to say? The world has already crucified our Lord on the cross. Today, we are on the Lord&rsquo;s side, and we can only say, &ldquo;World, from your point of view, I am crucified. From my point of view, you are also crucified.&rdquo; Today, it is impossible for these two sides to communicate. It is impossible for the world to come over. It is also impossible for us to go over. The cross is a fact. If I have no way to annul the cross, I have no way to win the world over to my side. My Lord has died, and there is no longer any possibility of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Once we see the cross we can say, &ldquo;I boast in the cross.&rdquo; As far as we are concerned, the world is crucified on the cross. As far as the world is concerned, we are crucified on the cross (Gal. 6:14). The cross will be forever history and a fact. As Christians, we are on one side, while the world is on the other side. The cross is in between. As soon as we open our eyes, we will see nothing but the cross. If we want to see the world, we have to see the cross first.</p>
<p>A new believer must be led by the Lord to see that his condition should match the Lord&rsquo;s condition. Some people ask many questions. They ask, &ldquo;Will we touch the world if we do this?&rdquo; And they ask, &ldquo;Can we do that?&rdquo; We cannot tell people what to do item by item. We only need to give them the general principle. The world is against the cross; it is against our Lord. If our heart is open and soft before God and if we go to Him, the difference between the world and the cross spontaneously will become clear to us.</p>
<p>As soon as we go to the Lord, we will find out what the world is and what the world is not. We only need to ask, &ldquo;What is my relationship with this matter, and what was the Lord Jesus&rsquo; relationship with it while He was on the earth?&rdquo; As long as our relationship with the world is the same as the Lord&rsquo;s, we are all right. If our position is different from the Lord&rsquo;s position, we have erred. The Lamb was slain, and we are the followers of the Lamb. We are those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go (Rev. 14:4). We take the same stand as that of the Lord. Anything that is not on the same ground as the Lord or that stands against the Lord is the world, and we must depart from it.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Anything That Quenches<br />
Our Spiritual Life</h2>
<p>It is difficult for us to point out the world item by item; the list is endless. But we should grasp one basic principle: everything that quenches one&rsquo;s spiritual life in the Lord is the world. The world is anything that kills one&rsquo;s zeal for prayer to God. The world is anything that takes away one&rsquo;s interest in God&rsquo;s Word. The world is anything that frustrates one from testifying before men. The world is anything that hinders one from coming to the Lord, anything that results in confession. The world is an atmosphere that chokes and dries a person up. It is anything that discourages a man&rsquo;s heart from loving and yearning for the Lord. Here we see a broad principle&mdash;anything that quenches our spiritual condition before the Lord is the world. We must reject all of it.</p>
<p>Some people say, &ldquo;This thing is not sinful at all. Can you say that it is worldly?&rdquo; Many things appear to be very good to our eyes, but they quench the fire within us after we touch them once or twice. Our conscience becomes weak before God. After we become involved with these things, our Bible reading becomes tasteless. We may have the time, but we no longer have the heart for reading. After we participate in such things, we feel empty inside and have nothing to testify before men. Such things may not be a matter of sin. Our question is whether or not these things are quenching our spiritual life. Everything that quenches our spiritual life is the world and must be rejected totally before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Everything That Fails to Give Others<br />
the Impression That We Are Christians</h2>
<p>We need to mention one more thing&mdash;our relationship with other people. Any kind of social function, communication, or activity that causes us to hide our lamp under the bushel is the world. Many social friendships, functions, and contacts with worldly people force us to put our lamp under the bushel; there is no way under those circumstances for us to stand up to declare that we are Christians. When others engage in such conversation, you have to pretend to be courteous. You have to listen to them and laugh with them. You feel quenched within, but you have to put on a smiling face. Inwardly you feel that this is the world, yet outwardly you have to go along with it. Inwardly you know this is sin, yet outwardly you cannot say that it is wrong. You should not remain in this kind of social environment. Many of God&rsquo;s children are gradually sucked into the world through indiscriminate social activities and contacts.</p>
<p>All new believers must know where they stand from the very beginning, and they must make a choice. We are not trying purposely to be antisocial. We are not John the Baptist who did not eat or drink. We follow our Lord who ate and drank. But when we contact people, we must maintain our stand. No one should be able to insult our Christian stand. They should respect our stand. When I take a stand as a Christian, I must maintain my stand even if others criticize me.</p>
<p>If we really want to take the way of separation from the world, we must pay attention to our speaking. We must also show our Christian stand every time we are in the company of others. If we cannot maintain our stand as Christians, it is better to turn away from where we are. Psalm 1:1 says that we should not &ldquo;stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the company of mockers.&rdquo; If we stand on the path of sinners, we will end up in their place sooner or later. If we sit in the company of mockers, we will become mockers sooner or later. Sin and mocking are contagious. We must learn to flee these things as if we are fleeing from germs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Things Disapproved of by Weak Believers</h2>
<p> Things which stumble a weak conscience are another class of things that constitute the world. God&rsquo;s children must learn to turn away from them. The previous discussion concerns things which the world considers improper. Here we are talking about things which a young Christian considers improper. If a Gentile thinks that we should not do a certain thing, we will lose our testimony if we do it. Similarly, we should avoid anything that a Christian disapproves of, even if the one who disapproves is the youngest and weakest of all Christians. This is the biblical commandment. It is not the words of the strong Christian but the words of the weak Christian that should determine what we should or should not do. What they say may not be correct; what they consider forbidden may not be wrong. But we should not stumble them because their conscience is weak. They may think that we are on the wrong way. If we take such a way, we will stumble them. Paul said, &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:12). All things are lawful, but others may consider these things to be a form of the world. Therefore, we should not do them for their sake.</p>
<p>Paul spoke of the example of eating meat. He said that if eating meat would stumble a brother, he would never eat meat. This is not easy. Who can abstain from meat forever? Paul&rsquo;s word does not suggest that one should not eat meat. In 1 Timothy he clearly said that it is wrong to abstain from meat. However, he showed us that he was willing to carry such caution to the extreme. It did not matter to him whether or not he ate meat. He might have been clear about what he was doing, but others who followed him may not have known what he was doing. We may know at which point we should stop, but those who follow may not know this. What would happen if they take a few steps further? There is nothing wrong if we eat meat, but after awhile those who follow us may go to the temple to eat the sacrifices or perhaps worship the idols as well. Many things may not be directly related to the world, but we should still exercise care in touching them because others may consider them a form of the world.</p><h2 class="head1">III. COMING OUT FROM THEIR MIDST<br />
TO BE WELCOMED BY THE ALL-SUFFICIENT LORD</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, &ldquo;Therefore &lsquo;come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you&rsquo;; &lsquo;and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the New Testament the words Lord Almighty are used for the first time in 2 Corinthians 6. <em>Lord Almighty</em> is <em>Elshadai</em> in Hebrew. <em>El</em> is God, <em>sha</em> is a mother&rsquo;s breast or milk, and <em>shadai</em> means something that is with milk. In Hebrew <em>shadai</em> means &ldquo;all-sufficient.&rdquo; The words <em>Almighty God</em> in the Old Testament are also <em>Elshadai,</em> which should be translated as &ldquo;the All-sufficient God.&rdquo; The mother&rsquo;s milk is all that a child needs. The mother&rsquo;s breasts contain the milk; all the supply is in the breasts. The root of the word <em>shadai</em> is &ldquo;the mother&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo; This means that with God we have everything.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 6:17 tells us that if we come out from their midst and do not touch their unclean things, God will welcome us and be a Father to us. We shall be sons and daughters to Him, says the <em>All-sufficient</em> Lord. We can see that these words have not been spoken lightly. The Lord is saying, &ldquo;Because of Me you have left many things. You have come out from their midst and are separated from them. You have terminated your relationships with them and are no longer touching their unclean things. Your two hands are empty, and there is nothing left in you. Now that you have done all this, I will welcome you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please remember that everyone who feels welcomed by the Lord is separated from the world. Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse. Those who have not counted all things as refuse surely consider earthly things precious. Such people do not know what it means for God to welcome them; they do not know what it means for God to be their Father and for them to be God&rsquo;s children. They do not know that the One who spoke these words is the all-sufficient Lord. Can you see the special significance of the word <em>shadai?</em> The words <em>Lord Almighty</em> are used here because when a person has cast away everything, he needs God as the <em>Shadai;</em> he needs a Father who is all-sufficient.</p>
<p>Psalm 27:10 tells us that if our father and mother forsake us, Jehovah will take us up. In other words, He becomes our father. Psalm 73:26 says that when our flesh and our heart fail, God is the rock of our heart and our portion forever. Herein lies the sweetness of our experience. There must be loss on one side before there can be gain on the other side. The blind man met the Lord only after he was cast out of the synagogue (John 9:35). If we remain in the synagogue, we will never meet the Lord. But when we are cast out, we see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing upon us immediately.</p>
<p>As new believers we must come out from the world. Only then will we taste the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness. Once we drop something on one side, we will taste the goodness of the Lord on the other side.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">JOINING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:19, 22; 1 Cor. 12:13, 27</h1>
<p>The immediate question every believer asks after his conversion concerns joining a church. We have covered the matter of separation from the world. This does not mean, however, that a person only needs to separate himself from the world and then can stop there. On the positive side, he needs also to join the church. (The phrase <em>joining the church</em> is not a proper one; however, we will borrow it for our use for the time being.)</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED TO JOIN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Twenty or more years ago, when our testimony first began, six to eight out of ten persons who were saved had no thought of joining a church. This was very strange! They thought that it was good enough to be a Christian by themselves and that there was no need to join a church. You may think this is a very strange thought, but according to our experience, quite a number of people think this way. They want Christ, but they do not want the church. They want to have something to do with Christ, but they do not want to have anything to do with the church. They want to be solitary Christians. Can we pray by ourselves? Yes. Therefore, they say that this is enough! Can we read the Bible by ourselves? Yes. Therefore, they think that this is enough! They think that as long as one can pray and read the Bible by himself, it is good enough. They think that it is troublesome to join with others and that it is good enough as long as one believes in the Lord and fellowships with Him alone. This concept exists in China, and it exists in other countries.</p>
<p>However, we must realize that whether we like it or not, we have no choice but to join the church. When a person is saved, he should see that there is an individual aspect as well as a corporate aspect to his Christian life. On the individual side, he has received the Lord&rsquo;s life, and he can fellowship with the Lord and pray by himself. He can lock himself up in a room and believe in the Lord by himself. However, if he only knows the individual aspect, his testimony will not be complete. In fact, he will not last long and will grow very little. I have never seen a reclusive Christian progress well, none in the past and none at present. During the two thousand years of church history, many people have thought that they could be believers individually. They have thought that they could live like hermits, shutting themselves up on a mountain and caring for nothing except their fellowship with the Lord. But the spiritual lessons that these ones experienced were very shallow; they could not withstand temptation. When the environment was right, they thrived. When the environment became adverse, they could not persevere.</p>
<p>We must realize that there is another side to the Christian life&mdash;the corporate side. In the Bible, as far as the corporate aspect is concerned, no one can be a solitary Christian. First of all, God&rsquo;s Word tells us that when a person is saved, he becomes a member of God&rsquo;s household; he becomes God&rsquo;s child. This is the revelation of the Bible. Once a person is born again, he is born into God&rsquo;s family, and he becomes God&rsquo;s child together with many other children of God.</p>
<p>Second, the Bible shows us that all the saved ones are God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, God&rsquo;s house. This house is different from the household or family we spoke of earlier. The household refers to the family, while the house refers to the dwelling place.</p>
<p>Third, Christians are collectively called the Body of Christ. We are members one of another, and together we are the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Children of God<br />
Together with Many Others in God&rsquo;s Family</h2>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, he receives not only an individual life but also a life that is related to many other people. As members of God&rsquo;s family, His dwelling place, and the Body of Christ, we are merely a part of the whole. It is impossible for us to exist alone. If we tried, we would surely miss the fullness and the riches in God. We may be a useful part, but if we are not joined to others, we are like a piece of cloth cut off from the whole or a spare part of a big machine, and we cannot express the light of the fullness of the highest form of life. The fullness of that light exists only in the church.</p>
<p>One cannot live in a family with five brothers and sisters without being related to them. If I am the only child of my father, I do not have to deal with any brothers or sisters in the family, because I have none. But if I have five brothers and sisters in my family, I am no longer my father&rsquo;s only child; I am one of five children. How can I not be related to the other brothers and sisters and remain the only son to my father? How can I lock myself up in a room and tell the others, &ldquo;Do not bother me. I have nothing to do with you. I am here to be my father&rsquo;s only son&rdquo;? How can one do that?</p>
<p>When a person believes in the Lord, he does not become God&rsquo;s only begotten son. He is one among God&rsquo;s millions of sons. He cannot lock himself up and be his Father&rsquo;s only son. The very nature of the life you have received does not allow this. In the physical family, you may be an only child without any brother or sister. But since the day you believed in the Lord, you are bound in fellowship to the other brothers and sisters. You cannot escape from this. On that day, you were born into the biggest family in the whole world. No other family is as big as this one. You have millions and millions of brothers and sisters. You cannot belittle them just because there are so many of them. Because you are only one among many, there is the need for you to know them; there is the need for you to fellowship with them and to be related to them. If you have no desire at all to see them, I have doubts about whether or not you are really a brother or a sister. If you are born of God, you will be drawn towards those who are also born of God. If you can shut yourself off from them, I have doubts about whether or not you are a child of God at all.</p>
<p>The concept of being an individual Christian is not a Christian concept at all. This concept does not and should not belong to a Christian. In our own family we should be brothers to all our brothers and sisters to all our sisters. How much more should this be true in the family of God? This relationship flows forth from the life of God and is full of love. It is a strange thing for anyone to have no affection for his own brothers and sisters or to have no desire to communicate with them! We must remember that while we receive God&rsquo;s life to be His children individually, the life we obtain is also in thousands of other children of God. I am only one among many brothers. The very nature of the life I possess does not allow me to be individualistic. It desires instead to communicate with all the other brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Becoming God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place<br />
Together with Other Brothers and Sisters</h2>
<p>The Bible also shows us that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is spoken of in Ephesians 2. This fact is one of the greatest revelations in the entire New Testament. We should realize that God has a dwelling place on earth. He needs a dwelling place. In the Bible we see the thought of a dwelling place from Moses&rsquo; tabernacle to Solomon&rsquo;s temple, including the later rebuilding and restoration of the temple. In the church age God is making man His temple. God once dwelt in a big building&mdash;Solomon&rsquo;s temple. But today God dwells in the church; the church has now become the dwelling place of God. We have been gathered together to be the dwelling place of God. We as God&rsquo;s many children have been gathered together by the Holy Spirit to be the dwelling place of God. This is covered in 1 Peter 2:5. We are the living stones being built into the spiritual house.</p>
<p>How is the spiritual house built? Solomon&rsquo;s temple was built with dead stones. But today the dwelling place of God is built with living stones. Peter, whose name means &ldquo;a stone,&rdquo; was a living stone. When all the living stones come together, they become a temple. If they are not together, can one stone be a house by itself? No! If no stone is upon another, it is a mark of desolation; this is not a good sign. No stone being upon another is a result of judgment and desolation. As long as we have a house, we have one stone upon another. Thank God that today we are saved and have believed in the Lord Jesus; we are now stones. What use does a single stone have if it is left alone? But when the stones are put together, they become a house. When they are isolated, they are useless. In fact, they may become stumbling stones instead of living stones.</p>
<p>Today we are like the accessory parts of a car. When all the parts are assembled together, we have a car which can be driven around. We dare not say that those who are living stones will become dead if they become isolated. But we can say that if a stone is not joined to other stones to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, it will lose its function and spiritual riches. As a living stone, we must be joined to other living stones. Only then can we contain God and only then will God dwell among us.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago an Englishman by the name of Mr. Stooneg said, &ldquo;After I was saved, a most wonderful thing happened to me. One day I came to realize that I was building material in the dwelling place of God. This is a most wonderful discovery.&rdquo; The first time I read this, I did not think too much about it. What is so wonderful about being building material in God&rsquo;s dwelling place? But today, as I ponder over it, I appreciate Mr. Stooneg&rsquo;s word. Once such a feeling is in you, you will realize how wonderful this is.</p>
<p>Thank God! We are indeed material for the spiritual dwelling place of God. If we, as building material, are detached from the building, we will be useless. At the same time, God&rsquo;s dwelling place cannot go on without us as stones. Without us as stones, there will be holes in God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and thieves will get into this building. Since I am the building material for God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God cannot go on without me.</p>
<p>Brothers, we must see that we are the building material the Holy Spirit is using for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. If you are by yourself, you will lose God&rsquo;s riches. You will not be able to contain God. You must be joined to the brothers and sisters. Only then can you contain God. A wooden bucket which contains and carries water is made out of pieces of wood. If you remove a piece of wood from the bucket, the whole container will no longer hold water. The nature of the individual pieces of wood has not changed, but the riches they contain have changed. Each piece can be soaked with a little water, but it will never hold much water; it will lose all the riches. We are God&rsquo;s house, and as soon as we become isolated we lose all the riches.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you may not see it clearly today. But gradually you will see more and more clearly. As soon as you believe in the Lord, spontaneously there is an inclination within you to contact other children of God. There is a desire within you to look for other materials, other stones. You must go along with this nature. Do not isolate yourself from others through concepts of your own.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the Body of Christ<br />
Together with All the Members</h2>
<p>Third, we are joined together in the Body of Christ to become one Body. We are the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body. First Corinthians 12:12 says that there are many members but one Body. These verses show us that it is impossible for a Christian to be individualistic. As a member in God&rsquo;s family, I may be a peculiar person. It may be possible for me not to communicate with all the brothers and sisters. As long as there is no problem between my father and me, I can shut myself in as a solitary child of God. As God&rsquo;s dwelling place, even though I am a living stone, I can be left alone if I do not like to be built with others. Before Peter joined the church, he was a living stone, but he still was an individual one. You may say, &ldquo;I do not care if this means leaving a hole in the building. Let there be a hole; I want to be an individual Christian.&rdquo; It is possible to do this.</p>
<p>However, there is something more than being the family and the building. God says that we are one Body. Perhaps you are an eye, a hand, or a leg in the body today. An eye is only useful when it is on the head. If it is put in a glass bottle, it is useless. A leg is only useful when it is placed in the body. If it is hung in an upper room, it is useless. Please remember that the body and each member functions in this way. No member can be separated from other members. This relationship is an indissoluble one. One may argue that he can be separated from God&rsquo;s family and from God&rsquo;s dwelling place. But it is impossible for anyone to say that he can be separated from the Body of Christ. Your ear cannot declare independence just because it is unhappy with the other members. Likewise, your hand cannot declare independence just because it is unhappy with the other members. Your leg cannot stand up and say, &ldquo;I want to be left alone.&rdquo; We have no other choice but to be joined together.</p>
<p>The life we have received does not allow us to be individualistic. The Lord has not given us an independent life. We must emphasize this fact&mdash;the Lord has not given us a life that is independent in itself. The life that we have received is sustained by the life of others. If we had received an independent life, we could live by ourselves. But we have received a dependent life. We have to depend on our brothers and sisters, and they have to depend on us.</p>
<p>Please remember that a member can never stand alone. Once it is alone, it cannot survive. Once it is isolated, it loses all the riches, all the life. If the saints and I are indeed one Body, I can no longer be an individual Christian. By now this should be more than clear. The life I have received demands that I be joined to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Every Christian Becoming One<br />
by Attaching Himself to Other Christians</h2>
<p>I hope that you will join yourself to other Christians once you become a believer. Do not remain a loner after you are a Christian for eight or ten years. Once we have become Christians, we have to see that the life we received from God is a dependent life. God has not given us an independent life. We are Christians attached to many other Christians. Among us, no one is detached. All Christians are attached to other Christians.</p>
<p>You have heard of offices that are attached to a company. You have heard of departments that are attached to a ministry. You also have heard of people who are attached to a working unit. In the same way, every Christian is attached to other Christians. Everyone is attached to one another. In the eyes of God, no Christian has the strength to exist alone. I hope that you will be attached to others from the beginning; I hope that you will be a Christian who lives by attaching yourself to many other Christians. Through this attachment, you receive the supply, the building up, the love, and the fellowship.</p>
<p>This is the reason that a Christian has to join the church. (The phrase <em>joining the church</em> is a non-biblical expression. However, we borrow this expression for the sake of the new ones&rsquo; understanding.) We cannot be private Christians. We only can be Christians who join together with all of God&rsquo;s children. We only can be Christians who are attached to other Christians. We should be involved with other people. We should be like the vines of a climbing plant&mdash;always attached to other people. As Christians we should attach ourselves to other Christians.</p><h2 class="head1">II. WHICH CHURCH TO JOIN</h2>
<p>We should join the church. But there are so many churches. Which one should we join? It is true that some have heard the gospel through you; they may have been saved through you. But many sober-minded persons will not automatically accept your church just because you have introduced them to the Lord. They will consider and want to know which church they should join out of the many.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Differences between the<br />
Many Kinds of Churches</h2>
<p>The history of the church is very long; it spans over two thousand years. Different churches have been raised up at different times. This results in differences based on time. Churches also have been raised up in different places. This results in differences based on geography. Churches also have been raised up through different servants of God. This results in differences based on persons. Here we see three differences based on time, place, and persons. This is not all. Because there are so many doctrines in the Bible, some have set up churches by emphasizing a particular kind of doctrine, while others have set up other churches by emphasizing other doctrines. As a result, different emphases on doctrines have created different churches as well. When a certain need arises in a certain place, certain individuals are raised up to emphasize certain teachings. As a result, a church is produced. The point of emphasis thus becomes the basis for forming churches.</p>
<p>The above factors have led to the formation of the many churches. How many different churches are there in the world today? There are over fifteen hundred different kinds of churches, and these are only the orthodox ones, the ones which are well established. Moreover, this number only reflects the number of different church systems; it does not take into account the various local congregations within each system. If we considered the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists, and other well-established groups each as one church, there would be about fifteen hundred such churches. Brothers, when I put myself in your place, I can see why it is not an easy task to choose from among a list of fifteen hundred churches!</p>
<p>With so many churches and so much confusion, is there a right way we can take before the Lord? Thank God, there is a way! God&rsquo;s Word is still with us, and we can read it and find out what God has to say. Thank God that the Bible has shown us which church we should join. God has not left us in the dark.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Reasons for the Many Different Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Different Places</h2>
<p>Let us study in detail the divisions of the church. Some divisions have occurred because of locality. For example, the Anglican Church is actually the Church of England. Anglican means that it came from England; in fact, it is the state church of England. But when it spread from England to America, it became the Episcopal Church or the Church of England in America. When it spread to China, it became the Church of England in China. Furthermore, when the Church of England in America spread to China, it became the Church of England in America in China. The Anglican Church first spread to America and then to China. The result is the Chinese American Anglican Church. What confusion this is!</p>
<p>Consider the example of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is, in fact, the Church of Rome. We are in Shanghai. What has a Roman church got to do with us here? It is wrong for the Church in Rome to set up churches in other places. This is a confusion of locality. What is the Anglican Church doing in America? What is the American Church doing in China? What is the Roman church doing in Shanghai? What is the Shanghai Church doing in Foochow? Every church that is founded upon a place eventually becomes a confusion.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Different Times</h2>
<p>This is not all. Many churches are divided according to time. Different churches have been established at different times. Consider what happened in China: The Nestorians first established their churches in the Tang Dynasty during their evangelization of China. The Nestorians were Christians who came to China to preach the gospel during the Tang Dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty the Roman Catholic Church came from the West to set up churches also. The churches set up in the Tang Dynasty could not be united with the churches set up in the Ming Dynasty because they were established at different times. When the Protestants came to China during the Ching Dynasty, they established more churches. Now we have the churches of the Tang Dynasty, the churches of the Ming Dynasty, and the churches of the Ching Dynasty. The Brethren came after the formation of the Republic. Now we have another big group&mdash;the Brethren, in addition to the Nestorians, the Roman Catholics, and the Protestants. The Brethren are another group of people; they established another church. Many of these churches came into existence because of the difference in time. Here we see that the church is divided not just according to locality. Even when all the Christians come from the same place, the fact that they are established at different times can also become a factor of division.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Different Persons</h2>
<p>This is not all. Throughout church history there have also been divisions based on persons. The church set up by John Wesley became the Wesleyan Church. The church set up by Martin Luther became the Lutheran Church. The church became divided through different persons. There is the Wesleyan denomination and the Lutheran denomination. All of these are divided according to people.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Emphasis on Different Truths</h2>
<p>Some divisions are based on a different emphasis of the truth. Those who emphasize justification by faith are called the &ldquo;Justification by Faith&rdquo; Church (i.e., the Lutheran Church). Those who emphasize holiness have become the Holiness Church. Those who emphasize the Holy Spirit are called the Pentecostal Church. Those who emphasize apostolic miracles are called the Apostolic Faith Church. Those who emphasize independence of local congregations are called the Congregational Church. Those who emphasize presbyterian administration and believe in the succession of apostolic authority through the elders are called the Presbyterian Church. Those who believe in the succession of apostolic authority through the bishops are called the Bishop&rsquo;s Church. They have one bishop for one church. Those who emphasize water immersion have become the Baptist Church. Those who came from Bath are called the Bath Congregation. There are such congregations in Canton. Even among those who believe in justification by faith, those who came from Germany are called the Lutherans, while those who came from Holland are called the Dutch Reformed Church. We can see that all kinds of differences exist among the churches throughout the whole world. Every church has its own history and doctrine. In the midst of such confusion, which way should you take? It is difficult to find a church in a your locality to join.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CHURCHES BEING DIFFERENT IN LOCALITY ONLY</h2>
<p>Is there a way out for us? Yes! The Bible is very simple and clear concerning the truth of the church; it is not confusing at all. We can see this in a few verses. The opening words of many Epistles, such as the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles and Revelation, show us such expressions as the church in Rome, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, the church in Ephesus, the church in Colossae, and so on. There were many different churches. In Acts there is the church in Antioch, and in Revelation there are seven churches. There is no doubt that there are distinctions between churches in the Bible, but there is one, and only one, kind of distinction. What is this distinction? You can answer this question yourselves because it is very clear.</p>
<p>Some doctrines in the Bible have two sides. It may not be easy deciding which side should be taken. But if there is only one side to a truth and you make a mistake about it, it means that you are very foolish and blind. Some passages in the Bible say that justification is by faith, while other passages say that justification is by works. We have the book of Romans, and we also have the Epistle of James. One can excuse himself for confusion over such a doctrine. But concerning the church, there is only one way. It is inexcusable for anyone to be unclear about it. Corinth is a locality; so are Ephesus, Colossae, Rome, and Philippi. All of these are localities. In other words, the church can be divided only according to locality, nothing else. Is this clear to you? Corinth, Ephesus, and Colossae are cities. Therefore, the boundary of the church is the boundary of the city or the locality.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Anything Smaller than a Locality<br />
Not Being the Church</h2>
<p>No matter how big a church is, it cannot extend beyond the boundary of its locality. At the same time, no matter how small a church is, it cannot have anything less than the locality as its unit. If a church is smaller than a locality, it is not a church. If a church is bigger than a locality, it is not a church. What is smaller than a locality? For example, in the church in Corinth some said, &ldquo;I am...of Cephas.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am...of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am...of Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12). They divided the church in Corinth into four parts. This is making the church too small. Therefore, Paul told them they were divisive and sectarian. First Corinthians 1 shows that it is wrong for a church to be smaller than a locality. Was Paul good? Yes! Was Apollos good? Yes! Was Peter good? Yes! But it is wrong to divide the church according to these persons. The church is divided according to localities, not according to the apostles. Paul said that to divide the church according to the apostles is divisive, sectarian, and fleshly. Dividing the church this way is to take the way of the denominations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Boundary of a Church<br />
Not Being Bigger than the Locality</h2>
<p>It is also wrong for a church to be bigger than the boundary of its locality. Please read your Bible. The Bible speaks of &ldquo;the churches of Galatia&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:1), &ldquo;the churches of Asia&rdquo; (v. 19), and &ldquo;the churches of Judea&rdquo; (Gal. 1:22). In Judea there were many localities with churches. This is why we refer to them as the churches of Judea. We see this in Acts. In the book of Galatians we see &ldquo;the churches of Galatia.&rdquo; In Revelation 1:4 we see &ldquo;the...churches which are in Asia.&rdquo; After reading these portions of the Scripture, we should be quite clear about what the Bible says concerning this matter. No church is ever bigger than a locality. Galatia was a province in the Roman Empire; it was not a locality. This is why the Bible does not say, &ldquo;The <em>church</em> of Galatia,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;The <em>churches</em> of Galatia.&rdquo; There were several churches in Galatia. This is why the plural word <em>churches</em> is used instead of the singular <em>church.</em> Therefore, it is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality.</p>
<p>The Bible does not say, &ldquo;the <em>church</em> in Asia,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the seven <em>churches</em> which are in Asia&rdquo;! Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were all localities in Asia. These seven places did not become one united church. They remained seven churches in Asia. It is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality. These seven churches did not become one big church. In the same principle, we see &ldquo;the <em>churches</em> of Judea&rdquo; because at that time Judea was a province of Rome. Originally, it was a nation. Later, it became a province. In the province of Judea there were many localities with churches. They could not be combined together to become one church.</p>
<p>We must see that God ordains to have only &ldquo;the church in Foochow&rdquo;; there cannot be an &ldquo;XXX church in Foochow.&rdquo; Having this would make the church smaller than its locality. Neither can anyone unite all the churches in the province of Fukien and make them one church. We can only have &ldquo;the <em>churches</em> in Fukien,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the <em>church</em> in Fukien&rdquo;; to have such would make the church bigger than its locality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Church Bearing<br />
Only the Name of the Locality</h2>
<p>Brothers, we must be clear that the church cannot be named after a person, a doctrine, a system, or the place of its origin. It should be identified only by the name of its locality, not the name of its place of origin. There can only be &ldquo;the church in Foochow&rdquo;; there cannot be &ldquo;the church of Shanghai in Foochow.&rdquo; You cannot have the Roman Church in Shanghai. The Roman Church has to go back to Rome. If some believers from the church in Rome come to Shanghai, they can be part of the church in Shanghai, but they cannot set up a Roman Church in Shanghai. The place of origin cannot be brought to Shanghai. The Anglican Church should go back to England. The Anglican believers that come to Shanghai should become the believers in the church in Shanghai. They should not bring the Anglican Church to Shanghai. The church can only be local. In His Word, God has ordained that the church should be divided only according to locality, not nationality. There should not be any Chinese Church or Anglican Church. There can only be the church in London and the church in Shanghai. They are only localities. Churches are based on locality, not nationality. There is no such thing as &ldquo;the Church of Christ in China&rdquo; in the Bible.</p>
<p>There should not be any distinction of people, nationality, or doctrines. God&rsquo;s Word only allows one kind of distinction&mdash; according to locality. Wherever you are, you are a member of the church in that locality. If you want to change your church, you have to change your locality. If I am in Foochow, and I cannot get along with a brother, there is only one way for me to leave the church in Foochow&mdash;I have to leave Foochow. God only recognizes the difference of locality. He does not recognize any other difference. I hope you will receive God&rsquo;s mercy to see that there is only one church and that the church is local.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HOW TO JOIN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Finally, how do we join the church? The Bible does not say anything about joining the church. This very fact invalidates the expression <em>joining the church.</em> However, we are forced to borrow human expressions. There is no better expression; therefore, we still use the expression <em>joining the church.</em></p>
<h2 class="head2">A. &ldquo;Joining the Church&rdquo; Not Being Necessary,<br />
Not Being Possible</h2>
<p>We must see that the Bible never speaks of joining the church. It is impossible for one to join the church. This is like an ear deciding to join the body to become an ear. Even the best surgeon cannot do such a thing. No one can join the church. If you are in, you are in; if you are not in, you are not in. Being a part of the church does not mean that one passes a test that qualifies him to be a member of a church. If a person wants to &ldquo;join&rdquo; the church, he must first be in the church.</p>
<p>If a person sees something concerning sin and the blood through God&rsquo;s mercy and if he has received salvation, forgiveness, and a new life, having been regenerated through resurrection by God, He has put such a one into the church already. He is already in the church. He is already in and there is no need for him to join. Some people still think that they can join a church. But if there is a church which one can join, such a church must not be a genuine church. One can join such a church because it is a false church. If it were a genuine church, no one could join it even if he tried to. As long as you belong to the Lord and are begotten by Him, you are already in the church; there is no need for you to join.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is neither necessary nor possible for one to join a church. You cannot join a church even if you try. And if you are already in the church, there is no need to join it anyway. Those who are in are in already; there is no need to join. Anyone who wants to join is not in it, and there is no way to join it. This is what the church is all about. The church is a peculiar institution. The issue is whether or not you are born of God. If you are born of God, you are already in. If you are not born of God, you cannot get in even if you try to. You cannot join a church by signing a document, sitting for an examination, writing your resolution, or making up your mind. If you are born of God, you are already in. Thank God that all of us are already in the church; we no longer need to join it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Need to Seek Fellowship in the Church</h2>
<p>If this is the case, why are we telling you to join the church? We are merely borrowing an expression that you can understand. You are a member of the church already. Although it is true that you are saved by God, you are also living among fellow human beings. Some may not know you. The brothers may not recognize you. Faith is something that occurs within you; no one else knows it. This is why you have to seek fellowship. You have to go to the church and tell others, &ldquo;I am a Christian; please receive me as a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If my father is Chinese, I do not have to join the Chinese race; I am already Chinese. If I am a believer, and the church does not know me, I can go to the church and say, &ldquo;You do not know me, but I am a Christian. Please receive me into your fellowship. Please receive me as one of your own.&rdquo; When the brothers realize that you are indeed one of them, they will have fellowship with you. This is what it means to join the church.</p>
<p>You are already a person in Christ. What you need to do now is to seek fellowship among God&rsquo;s children. You have to seek the fellowship of the members, the fellowship of the Body, and learn to serve God properly in the church. Once your eyes are open to this, thank the Lord, you have taken another step forward.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 6:1-2; Acts 8:14-17; 19:5-6; Psa. 133; Lev. 1:4; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33</h1>
<p>The Bible clearly shows us that a man needs to be baptized. The Bible also clearly shows us that a man needs to receive the laying on of hands. We can see this in two instances in Acts&mdash;in Samaria and in Ephesus. In both cases baptism was followed by the laying on of hands. This was clearly the apostles&rsquo; practice in their days. Today, if God&rsquo;s children are only baptized without experiencing the laying on of hands, their experience is not complete. The Bible clearly contains both the teaching and the pattern for this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE LAYING ON OF HANDS&mdash;A FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:1 tells us that we should leave the word of the beginning of Christ and be brought on to maturity. There are several truths in the Christian life which should never be compromised. They are the foundation. A believer does not need to lay this foundation again and again. However, it does need to be laid. What is the word of the beginning of Christ? It is repentance, faith, baptism, the laying on of hands, resurrection, and judgment. The Bible shows us clearly that the foundation of the word of Christ includes baptism and the laying on of hands. If we have received baptism without receiving the laying on of hands, we are short of this foundation in our pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>The error of the church today is altogether different from the error the Hebrew believers fell into at that time. The Hebrew believers already had laid the foundation, yet they wanted to lay the same foundation again and again, thus going about in circles. What about the church today? It has made some progress, but its foundation is not well laid. The apostle told the Hebrew believers to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and strive to be brought on to maturity. In the case of Christians today, they move forward too fast without laying this foundation at all. This is too hasty. You have to see that the laying on of hands is part of the foundation of the word of Christ. Those who have laid this foundation need to move forward, whereas those who have not must do so. Our teaching today is different from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching. He admonished people to leave something behind, whereas we exhort people to turn back to pick up these things.</p>
<p>If you have to build a house with six rocks as the foundation, you cannot afford to miss one. If one is missing, a problem will occur someday. Anything that serves as a foundation is indispensable. If baptism, as one part of the foundation, is missing, trouble will arise in the future. If the laying on of hands, as another part of the foundation, is missing, trouble will also arise down the road. One cannot be careless about the foundation. One cannot build a house upon a poorly laid foundation. If part of the foundation is missing, it must be completed before he can proceed with the rest of the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2>
<p>We have covered baptism and what it does for us. Baptism delivers us out of the world. Through baptism a man is saved and delivered out of the world. At the same time, baptism puts one into Christ and entitles him to a share in His resurrection. But what does the laying on of hands do for us? What does the laying on of hands mean?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions can be found in Leviticus 1, 3, and 4. These passages most frequently refer to the matter of the laying on of hands in the Old Testament. What is the meaning of a person laying his hands on the head of an animal in the Old Testament? There are two meanings.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Identification</h2>
<p>The first meaning is identification. Laying hands on an animal&rsquo;s head in Leviticus 1 meant that the offerer and the offering were united as one. This poses a question: Why did a person who came to the Lord to offer something, whether it was a sin offering or a burnt offering, not offer himself instead of a bull or a goat? God owns the bulls and the goats of the whole world. Does God have a need for just offerings of bulls and goats? When a man comes before the Lord, he must first offer up himself. Anything short of this will not satisfy God. An offering is a consecration of the offerer, not merely a sacrifice of a bull or a goat.</p>
<p>However, if I came to the altar and sacrificed myself, giving my body to be killed and burned as a burnt offering, would I not be the same as the Molech worshippers in the Old Testament? Those who worshipped Molech did not sacrifice bulls and goats to Molech; they sacrificed their own children. If our God demands that we sacrifice ourselves to Him, then is our God not the same as Molech? Molech demands our children&rsquo;s blood, and God demands that we present ourselves as offerings. If we have to put ourselves in the fire, does this not mean that God&rsquo;s demand is more severe than Molech&rsquo;s demand?</p>
<p>In one sense, God&rsquo;s demand is more severe than Molech&rsquo;s demand. But at the same time, God gives us a way to offer ourselves without being burned to death. What is this way? It is to take a bull and lay one&rsquo;s hands on its head. The most important part of a bull is its head. One can also take a goat and lay hands on its head. I lay both my hands on the bull&rsquo;s or goat&rsquo;s head. Before God, whether aloud or in silence, I pray, &ldquo;This is me. I am the one who should be on the altar. I am the one who should be burned. I should be the sacrifice, and I should be the one to redeem my own sin. I deserve to die. I offer myself to You as a burnt offering of sweet savor. Lord! I am bringing this bull to You with my hands on its head. This means that the bull and I are one and the same. My charge to the priest to kill it means that I am being killed. When its blood is shed, my blood is shed. When it lies on the altar, I am on the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did this not happen to us when we were baptized? When we went into the water, we said &ldquo;This is my grave. The Lord is burying me here.&rdquo; We took the water as our grave. Now, as we lay our hands on the bull&rsquo;s head, we identify ourselves with the bull. When we offer the bull to God, we are actually offering ourselves to Him. The bull represents us.</p>
<p>Hence, the laying on of hands signifies identification. In the Old Testament the primary meaning of the laying on of hands is identification with the offering. The offering and I have become one. We both stand in the same position. When the offering is brought before God, I am brought before God as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Transmitting Blessings</h2>
<p>The laying on of hands carries another meaning in the Old Testament. In Genesis Isaac laid his hands upon his two sons. Jacob did the same thing to his two grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh. When Jacob laid his hands on his two grandsons, he put one hand on each of his grandsons&rsquo; heads and blessed them. He transmitted his blessings to his two grandsons. He was blessing them and petitioning blessings for them. As a result, the blessings came and were bestowed upon them.</p>
<p>We must see the significance of the laying on of hands in these two aspects. One is union, or identification, and the other is transmission. Both are a kind of fellowship. Fellowship joins us to others and makes us one. Fellowship also transmits our strength to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>We need to go on to see why Christians should receive the laying on of hands. After we have believed in the Lord and are baptized, why do we need the apostles as representatives of the Body to come and lay hands on us?</p><h2 class="head2">A. God Pouring Oil<br />
on the Entire Body of Christ</h2>
<p>First, let us explain briefly the Body of Christ and the anointing. Please read 1 Corinthians 12:12-13 and Psalm 133. Christianity is truly peculiar. What is so peculiar about it? It has to do with God gaining a man on earth. This man subjected Himself perfectly to God; He absolutely represented God and absolutely lived out the life of God. Today God has made this man both Lord and Christ. God has poured out His own Spirit upon this man, Jesus the Nazarene. When God poured His Spirit upon Him and endued Him with the Spirit, God did not pour the Spirit upon Him individually. He poured it upon Him as the Head of the Body. God&rsquo;s anointing is on the Head. The Lord Jesus did not receive the anointing from God as an individual; He was standing in the position of the Head of the Body when He received the Spirit upon His head. In other words, He was anointed by God for the sake of the Body.</p>
<p>This is why He is called <em>the Anointed One,</em> and we are also called <em>the anointed ones.</em> His name is <em>Christos,</em> while our name is <em>Christoi</em>&mdash;Christians, Christmen. He is the Head, and the church is the Body. God does not want to have one individual man on earth. Rather, He is after a corporate man&mdash;the church. In itself, the church on earth cannot satisfy God; it cannot carry out what should be carried out; and it cannot maintain God&rsquo;s testimony, because it does not have God&rsquo;s power. Therefore, God has to anoint the church. When the church receives the anointing, it can satisfy God&rsquo;s demand. The anointing signifies God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s authority is poured upon the church through His anointing.</p>
<p>However, God does not anoint one or two members, nor does He anoint all the members. God only anoints the Head. In order for God&rsquo;s children to know the Holy Spirit, they must first know the Body. The Holy Spirit is not given firstly to the Body but to the Head. The whole Body receives the anointing because God has anointed the Head. Is this clear? It is not a matter of a single member receiving the Holy Spirit. It is neither a matter of all the members receiving the Holy Spirit. It is a matter of the Head receiving the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Anointing<br />
by Standing in the Position of the Body</h2>
<p>How then can we receive the anointing oil? We must stand in the position of the Body in order to receive it. If I stand in the position of the Body and take a proper place within the Body, the anointing will come to me spontaneously when it is poured upon the Head. The anointing is not given just to me. It is impossible for me to ask for the anointing for myself. Many people are deprived of any blessing because they come to God alone, hoping to receive the Holy Spirit and the anointing by themselves.</p>
<p>Please remember that the oil was poured upon Aaron&rsquo;s head. It flowed down to his beard and then to his garment. Aaron had a long garment which reached his feet and covered his whole body. As the oil was poured upon his head, it flowed to the lowest part of his body. Today a person enjoys the anointing because of his position in the Body, not because of his condition before God. If you stand under the Head, the anointing will reach you. If you do not stand under the Head, the anointing will not reach you. Receiving the anointing is not a personal matter, nor a matter of the whole Body. It is a matter of being in the Body and under the Head. When the Body submits to the Head and stands on the proper ground, it will receive the anointing.</p>
<p>In our spiritual walk, we need the power of the Holy Spirit. We will not walk according to the flesh only when the anointing becomes our power. The anointing is not poured upon man&rsquo;s flesh. Let us remind ourselves of this. We cannot act according to our own ideas. We need the anointing, but we cannot receive the anointing through asking and praying for it by ourselves. It is only as we stand in a normal relationship to the Body that we will receive the anointing.</p>
<p>We must see that the Bible never speaks about the anointing of the Body. Only the Head is anointed. But when the Head is anointed, we as His Body are also anointed. The anointing was not poured upon Aaron&rsquo;s body but upon his head. But the anointing flowed from Aaron&rsquo;s head down to his garment and eventually all over of his body. Only foolish ones will seek for an individual anointing or an anointing just for the Body. We must all submit to the Head and stand in the position the Head wants us to stand. Only then will we receive the anointing.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Laying On of Hands Being Done<br />
by the Representatives of Christ<br />
and His Body&mdash;the Apostles</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word shows us that each time a person is baptized into Christ, the representative authority established by God, such as the apostles, should lay hands upon such a one on behalf of the Head and the Body. This shows us the significance of the laying on of hands. When a person receives the laying on of hands, his head is lowered. This means that from that day on, he will no longer expose his own head. His head will submit to authority. It will not expose itself but will instead be under authority.</p>
<p>When an apostle, a representative of the Body, lays his hand on me, it means that he and I have fellowship and that we have become one. The apostles represent the Body because God has placed the apostles in the church first. This is why they represent the church. When an apostle, who represents the church, lays his hands on you and says, &ldquo;Brother, you are one with the Body of Christ,&rdquo; the anointing from the Head will flow to you. Because you are one with the Body, the anointing comes to you as well. This is the reason the apostle lays his hands upon you. The laying on of hands identifies you with the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The apostles represent not only the church but also Christ. God has placed the apostles in the church first. Being first means having authority. In other words, the apostles are the representative authority. Therefore, when an apostle&rsquo;s hand is upon your head, it is not only the church that is laying hands on you but also Christ who is laying His hands on you. This means that the Lord is bringing you under His authority. From that point on, you are under the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. HOW TO RECEIVE THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Need to Submit to the Authority of the Head</h2>
<p>We must be under the authority of the Head, and we must act as members in the Body of Christ. We should never presume that we can go on by ourselves. The very nature that we received when we were saved makes us members in the Body. This very nature does not allow us to be alone. Once we are by ourselves, we will die. We can live only when we are attached to the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Need to See the Importance of Identification</h2>
<p>We must see the importance of identification. After we see the importance of identification we can receive the blessing of transmission. If we do not see the importance of identification, there will be no blessing of transmission. The main thought behind the laying on of hands is identification. Although it also carries the function of transmitting, its main significance is identification.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Need to See That<br />
We Live by the Whole Body</h2>
<p>Today when brothers lay hands on you, it is not a vain or mindless act. Your eyes must be opened to see that from that day on, you have become a child among many children, a cell among many cells, and a member among many members. As a member, you live by the whole Body. If you live as an individual Christian, you are finished and you are useless. As soon as you cease fellowshipping with other children of God, trouble will come. No matter how strong you are, you cannot survive on your own. No matter how great and how wonderful you are, you are dead if you are severed from the Body. You cannot boast of your power. You are powerful only because you are in the Body. This is what the laying on of hands does for you. Once you leave the Body, you are finished.</p>
<p>As others lay their hands on you, you should have a realization within yourself: &ldquo;Lord, I cannot live by myself. I confess that I am a member in the Body. Without the Body I cannot live. Without the Body I cannot have the anointing.&rdquo; Is this clear? The anointing is on the Head. Therefore, you have to come under the headship; you have to submit to the authority of the Head along with all the other children of God. Individually you have to submit to Him, and you have to submit to Him in oneness with others. You have to submit directly, and you have to submit indirectly together with the whole Body. When you do this, the anointing will come to you. When you stand in this position, the anointing will spontaneously flow to you.</p><h2 class="head1">V. TWO CASES OF<br />
THE LAYING ON OF HANDS IN ACTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Case in Samaria</h2>
<p>Finally, we should look at the two cases in Samaria and Ephesus. As a result of Philip&rsquo;s evangelistic visit to Samaria, a group of people believed and were baptized. But they did not receive the Holy Spirit. The apostles in Jerusalem heard of this and sent Peter and John to Samaria to pray for the Holy Spirit to come upon them. While they prayed, they laid hands on them. As a result, the Holy Spirit came upon and anointed them.</p>
<p>Baptism is a declaration that we have forsaken the world, whereas the laying on of hands is a declaration that we have entered the Body. These are two sides of one thing. On the one hand, we are baptized and have forsaken the world, which is on the negative side. On the other hand, we entered into the Body the very moment someone laid his hands upon us. Since we are in the Body, we need to be identified with all the children of God and need to submit to the authority of the Head. If we put our entire being under the authority of the Head, we will experience the flowing of the anointing within. Once our position is right, the anointing will flow to us. If our position is wrong, the anointing will not flow to us. The Samaritans believed in the Lord and were saved. But they were in a peculiar predicament&mdash;the Holy Spirit had not come upon them. The apostles came and laid their hands on their heads, thus placing them under the authority of the Head, uniting and joining them to the entire Body. At that very moment a marvelous thing happened: The Holy Spirit descended upon them and the anointing flowed to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Case in Ephesus</h2>
<p>Let us now look at the case in Ephesus. During one of his evangelistic journeys, Paul arrived in Ephesus, where he met twelve disciples who had received only the baptism of John. Paul asked them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;On the contrary, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Paul then asked, &ldquo;Into what then were you baptized?&rdquo; (Acts 19:2-3). Paul saw the problem; they did not have the proper foundation.</p>
<p>How could a person not have the Holy Spirit if he had already believed in Jesus? There was definitely something wrong with their foundation. Into what were they baptized? The answer could be easily found. They had received only the baptism of John and had not been put into Christ. Therefore, Paul said that they needed to be baptized again, this time into the name of Christ. Then Paul laid hands on them. The laying on of hands follows baptism. One needs to get into the Body and submit to the authority of the Head. This is the meaning of the laying on of hands.</p>
<p>If a man is not baptized, he cannot receive the laying on of hands. A person must first be baptized, forsake the world, and enter into Christ, having died and resurrected. Then he must see that he should live by the Body and be under the authority of the Head. Then when he receives the laying on of hands, the Holy Spirit will descend upon him. The outward manifestation of the Spirit is not the primary focus of what is received. Rather, I must emphasize the inward flowing of the anointing.</p>
<p>Psalm 133 shows us that the Head has been anointed. The anointing of the Head equals the anointing of the Body, which equals the anointing of every member. Thank and praise God that when the anointing oil flowed down from the Head, we received it because we are in the Body. When we have the anointing, it is a small matter whether or not the Lord gives us outward signs. Please note that the outward signs at Pentecost are too external; they are not that crucial. We believe that the Holy Spirit still comes upon man today. Outward signs are merely one manifestation of the anointing. As long as there is the anointing, it matters little whether or not there are any outward signs. What is important is the source of the anointing. The anointing comes when the anointing of the Head becomes the anointing of the members. For this reason, prayers that are accompanied by the laying on of hands bear tremendous significance.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. AN EXCEPTION IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There is only one exception in the Bible concerning the laying on of hands. It happened in Cornelius&rsquo;s house. The Holy Spirit descended upon Cornelius&rsquo;s house before there was any baptism or laying on of hands. Cornelius&rsquo;s house was an exception because after Pentecost, all the apostles thought that the Lord&rsquo;s grace was confined to the Jews. They were conscious that they were the Jews and that the Lord Jesus was also a Jew. At Pentecost the Holy Spirit only descended upon the Jews. The three thousand and five thousand people who were saved at that time were all Jews. Those who received the Lord&rsquo;s grace were scattered Jews in dispersion who had returned to Jerusalem. Up to this time, the Lord&rsquo;s grace had been experienced only by the Jews. They were not sure whether this grace could be shared by foreigners&mdash;the Gentiles. Some Chinese call foreigners <em>foreign devils.</em> The Jews cursed the foreigners even more. They considered foreigners as animals and beasts. Even Peter could not drop this attitude. He had the same view as the others.</p>
<p>It is not easy to break through the barrier of man&rsquo;s darkness. This is why it was a great matter for the Lord to send Peter to Cornelius&rsquo;s house to open the door for the Gentiles to believe in Him. He first gave Peter a vision&mdash;a vessel descending from heaven like a great sheet with many things inside. The Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Slay and eat!&rdquo; (Acts 10:13). When Peter saw it, he said immediately, &ldquo;By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean&rdquo; (v. 14). This means he had never had any dealings with the Gentiles before. What should he do now? The sheet came down once, twice, three times. By then Peter became clear. Had it not been for this vision, Peter would never have become clear. Old concepts are really strong! This vessel came from heaven, and the Lord Himself spoke to him, yet Peter still had reservations about it. The Lord could do nothing except take back the sheet. When it came down from heaven the second time, the Lord spoke to him again, but he still could not understand. The sheet was taken back again. The third time the Lord sent the sheet down again and showed him the vision once more. He spoke to him again. By this third time, Peter became clear. He could not say, &ldquo;My eyes were mistaken,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I have forgotten what I have seen; I cannot remember clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this vision was unveiled, men from Caesarea came. Then it occurred to Peter that the Gentiles were also able to receive God&rsquo;s salvation. The dogs could eat the crumbs under the table. He went, but after he arrived at Cornelius&rsquo;s house, he still dared not baptize anyone. Cornelius&rsquo;s household had indeed believed, but Peter dared not baptize them for fear that the brothers who were with him might not accept it. They might say, &ldquo;Peter, you are acting independently.&rdquo; Peter was in an awkward position at that time. He was clear in himself, but the brothers were not clear.</p>
<p>At this point the Lord poured down the Spirit upon the Gentiles&mdash;before they were baptized and before they had received the laying on of hands. When Peter went back, he could say boldly, &ldquo;I only said a few words; the gospel was not even clearly presented. Yet the Holy Spirit came anyway. I had no alternative but to make up the lack by baptizing them.&rdquo; Baptism is to forsake the world and enter into Christ, whereas the laying on of hands is to receive the anointing. Cornelius&rsquo;s household had already received the anointing. Hence there was no more need for them to receive the laying on of hands. This is why Peter only baptized them.</p>
<p>Later, when Paul returned from Gentile lands to the church in Jerusalem, an argument followed concerning the Gentiles. Peter brought up the incident again and broke the deadlock. From that point on, the door to the Gentiles was opened.</p>
<p>In Samaria there was the laying on of hands, but in Caesarea there was not the laying on of hands. However, God used the case in Caesarea to confirm Paul&rsquo;s work and to settle the case in chapter fifteen. In chapter nineteen, when Paul came to Ephesus, he again practiced the laying on of hands. Therefore, the practice of the laying on of hands continued. It has not suffered an interruption since.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. GOING ALONG WITH OTHER CHILDREN OF GOD</h2>
<p>New believers need to realize that as believers, we cannot live alone. We cannot be solitary Christians. We must be fellow members together with other children of God. We must also learn to submit to the authority of the Head. We cannot be rebellious. We must submit to God together with the other children of God. If we do this, the anointing will be manifested in our living and our work spontaneously, and we will have a way to go on before the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">ABOLISHING ALL DISTINCTIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27-28; Col. 3:10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. BELIEVERS BEING ONE IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>After a new believer has received the laying on of hands, has come into the church, and has come under the headship of Christ, he has to see the oneness of believers in the Body of Christ. In other words, he has to realize the abolishment of all distinctions. This means that there should be no distinctions among believers who have become one in Christ.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free.&rdquo; The word <em>whether</em> signifies the removal of distinctions. There are no worldly distinctions in the Body of Christ. Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;And were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27-28 says, &ldquo;For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here it says that in Christ we all are one. We are those who have put on Christ. The words <em>put on</em> are just one word in the original text. It does not mean &ldquo;wearing&rdquo; as much as it does &ldquo;covering up.&rdquo; We were all baptized into Christ and have all put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, slave nor free man, male and female, for in Christ we all have become one. This means that our oneness in Christ has abolished all of our former distinctions.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says, &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; This passage also says that there are no more distinctions among believers. Galatians 3:28 says, &ldquo;There cannot be,&rdquo; and this verse also says, &ldquo;There cannot be.&rdquo; There cannot be distinctions because we have put on the new man. We have received and been incorporated into the new man, which was created according to the image of God. In this image there cannot be Greeks or Jews, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man, for Christ is all and in all. Therefore, all the believers are one; they have become a single entity.</p>
<p>From these three portions of the Scripture, we see that all believers are one in Christ, and all of their distinctions have been abolished. This is the basis upon which the church is built. If we bring all our earthly distinctions into the church and into the Lord, we will corrupt the church and spoil the relationships among the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We must see that we have all been made one in Christ. Our past distinctions no longer exist among us when we are in the Lord. There are no distinctions in the new man and in the Body of Christ. At least five distinctions are spoken of in the verses above. We see five contrasting pairs, but actually there are six differences. First, there is the difference between Greek and Jew. Then there is the difference between free man and slave. Following this there are differences between male and female, barbarians and Scythians, and circumcision and uncircumcision. According to the apostle Paul, no matter what differences there are among men, we all have been made one in Christ.</p>
<p>In this world, the most important thing to a person is his position, that is, his status. If I am a certain kind of person, I have to live up to my position or my status. But if we are to be Christians at all, these considerations must go. If we bring our personal status and position into the new man, we will make the new man old because these distinctions belong to the old man. Therefore, when we come to the church, we must give up all these things.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ANNULLING OF NATIONALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. There Being No Distinction<br />
between Jews and Greeks</h2>
<p>In the world the greatest distinction is based on nationality. The Jews and the Greeks are two very distinctive races. The Jews are very nationalistic. They are the descendants of Abraham, the chosen people of God; they are the only nation established by God on earth. They are separated from other nations and are a peculiar people unto God. But instead of humbling themselves before God and exalting Him, they are proud and boast of themselves before other races. Their pride carries their nationalism to an extreme degree. They despise all Gentile nations. In their eyes the Gentiles are animals, dogs. They do not recognize the Gentiles in any way.</p>
<p>This is why it is rather difficult to put a Gentile next to a Jew and ask them to be fellow Christians. A Jew may believe in the Lord Jesus and call himself a Christian, but it is very difficult to persuade him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. The book of Acts tells us that the gospel was preached first to the Jews on the day of Pentecost. Later, when the gospel reached Samaria, it was the Jews who were saved. In order to bring the gospel to the Gentiles, the Lord had to raise up Paul and charge him with the preaching. Even then, it did not immediately begin in Antioch. Peter had to make a start in Caesarea first. It was quite hard for Peter as an apostle to the Jews to go to the Gentiles. Therefore, he needed to see a vision three times and had to hear the Lord say three times, &ldquo;Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!&rdquo; Without this, Peter would never have dared go to the Gentiles. This was the first time the gospel was preached to the Gentiles, and it shows how reluctant the Jews were to preach to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>In Acts 15 a problem arose in the matter of circumcision and the keeping of the law. Some advocated that the Gentile believers needed to be circumcised and keep the law. They were, in effect, saying that in order for a Gentile to be a Christian, he had to be a Jew first. How strong was this nationalistic barrier! The Gentiles had to wait until Acts 15 before they were exempted from circumcision and from keeping the law. Peter and the others told Paul and Barnabas to go freely to the Gentiles and assured them that they would all remain in the same fellowship.</p>
<p>Galatians 2 tells us that Peter went to Antioch and ate with the Gentiles. But when certain people came from James, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. Paul openly rebuked Peter for not walking according to the truth of the gospel. The cross had already broken down the middle wall of partition, and there should be neither Jews nor Gentiles.</p>
<p>We may be a Jew or a Gentile. But may the Lord bless us to see that in Christ we all have been made one. Our nationality has been abolished and our national distinctions no longer exist. Whether one is a Chinese believer, an English believer, an Indian believer, or a Japanese believer, he has become a brother or sister in Christ. We cannot separate God&rsquo;s children by nationality. We cannot have Chinese Christianity. If it is Chinese then it is no longer Christ. It is either &ldquo;Chinese-ity&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christian-ity&rdquo;; there is no such thing as Chinese Christianity. These two terms contradict one another. We are all brothers and sisters in the Lord. There cannot be any national distinctions. This is quite obvious. In the Body of Christ, in the new man, we are fully one; there are no national distinctions of any kind. Even nationalism as strong as that of the Jews has been annulled by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Cross Breaking Down<br />
the Middle Wall of Partition</h2>
<p>Ephesians tells us about a wall between the Jews and the Gentiles. The two are separated. But the cross has broken down the middle wall of partition. There is no longer any distinction or separation. If we meet someone who is in Christ, we should not say that he is Chinese; he is a person in Christ. We should not say that someone is an Englishman; we should say that he is in Christ. We have all become one in Christ.</p>
<p>Never think of having a Chinese church or a Chinese testimony. This is a great mistake, and the idea should not even cross our mind. Please remember that in Christ, there is no distinction between Greeks and Jews. There is no such thing. If a brother or a sister introduces such a thing among us, it means that he or she is bringing in a foreign element. The result will be corruption within. We do not have any distinction between Jews and Greeks. In Christ we are all joined together. We have to eradicate all nationalistic notions from our heart. The moment we bring such a thing into the church, the church becomes an organization of the flesh and no longer the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Some people are so strong in their nationalistic feelings that they cannot be Christians in a proper way. Though we are Chinese and under the jurisdiction of our country, this relationship ceases when we are in Christ. Whenever we come before the Lord, we do not come as a Chinese person. Such a consciousness should be kept outside the door. We hope new believers will see from the very beginning that we are linked together in the life of Christ. I have received the life of Christ, and a brother in England or a brother in India or Japan has also received the same life of Christ. We are united according to the life of Christ, not according to our nationalities. We must have a very clear vision about this. In the Body, in Christ, and in the new man, nationality does not exist. That distinction has been totally abolished.</p>
<p>After the First World War, a few brothers from England went to Germany for a conference. During the conference, a brother stood up and introduced the British brothers with the words, &ldquo;The war is over, and some English brothers are here to visit us. We warmly welcome them.&rdquo; After this introduction, a brother from England stood up and said, &ldquo;We are not English brothers; we are brothers from England.&rdquo; This is a marvelous word. There are no English brothers; there are only brothers from England. How can there be an English brother, an American brother, a French sister, or an Italian sister in the house of God? Thank God, there are no national distinctions in Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are all part of the church. We have received the laying on of hands already. Now we must see that all distinctions between Greeks and Jews have been abolished. There are no longer any such distinctions in Christ. This is a glorious fact, a truly glorious truth. In the church there is only Christ. Christ is all and in all. There is nothing besides Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE ANNULLING OF CLASS DISTINCTIONS</h2>
<p>Another intransigent relationship in human society is class distinctions. We do not experience national distinctions too much unless we meet foreigners. However, we come across the problem of class distinctions daily. The apostle tells us that there is no class distinction between the free man and the slave. In Christ, there is no free man or slave. Such distinctions no longer exist.</p>
<p>Our generation has probably never experienced the sharp class separation which exists between the free man and the slave. However, Paul wrote his Epistles during Roman rule when the practice of slavery was at its zenith. At the time of the Roman Empire, there was a cattle market, a sheep market, and a human market. This can be compared to the textile exchange, the commodity exchange, the stock exchange, and the gold exchange in Shanghai. At that time in Rome, there was a human exchange. The Romans fought many wars and captured many people. They put these captives in the market for sale. If a master felt that the children of a slave were eating too much, he could bring the children to the market and sell them. Such a practice was very common in Rome. Human beings were bought and sold like goods. Profitability was measured by the number of children one produced; those who produced more were sold for a better price. At that time there was a great distinction between the free man and the slave.</p>
<p>Although the idea of democracy came from Rome, and although civil rights, suffrage, and voting began from Rome, these rights belonged to free men only; the slaves had nothing. If one killed a slave, he merely needed to negotiate the monetary worth of the slave with the master and pay accordingly. The slave had no civil rights; he was not considered a human being. Killing a slave was like killing a cow. The most one had to do was pay for the cow; there was no need to pay for the life. Children of slaves were slaves automatically, and they belonged to their master. For their whole life, they had no freedom of their own unless their master chose to release them. If they ran away, they would be crucified.</p>
<p>This kind of class distinction is many times harsher than that between masters and servants, employers and employees, and bosses and subordinates of today. Such distinctions no longer exist anywhere on earth. But long before the world abolished this practice, God&rsquo;s Word already had abolished such class distinctions. In the three Epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians, Paul stated that there was no distinction between the free man and the slave. Such a distinction is abolished in Christ.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the book of Philemon speaks of a slave of Philemon by the name of Onesimus. Philemon was a co-worker of Paul. When Onesimus believed in the Lord, he too became a brother. When they were at home, Onesimus was the slave and Philemon was the master. But if Philemon brought Onesimus to the meeting of the church, one would call Onesimus Philemon&rsquo;s brother, not his slave. In the church, relationships between masters and servants cease. When they knelt down to pray together, Onesimus was Philemon&rsquo;s brother. But when they rose up to do their work, Onesimus was Philemon&rsquo;s slave. In the Lord they were one, in the new man they were one, and in the Body they were one. Please pay attention to this: In Christ the master-slave relationship does not exist, in the new man this relationship does not exist, and in the church this relationship does not exist. In Christ all class distinctions are totally abolished. There is no more class consciousness or class struggle.</p>
<p>Before God we must see that today we may be a servant, a subordinate, or an employee. We should take our stand in the workplace and learn to submit to our superior or master. However, when we come before God, we should not yield to someone just because he is our master or boss. In our discussion over spiritual matters, we should not consider our master or our superior to be always right or his reasoning to be always correct. There is no such thing. Whenever we kneel down to pray or discuss spiritual matters, our status is changed, and there is no class distinction between us. We cannot introduce any class relationship into the church, because such a relationship does not exist in the church.</p>
<p>This fact is especially important when we come to the church meetings. Recall how James condemned such a sin. He said when a rich man comes, he is given a better seat, and when a poor man comes, he is told to stand or be seated at the footstool. James condemned such an act as a sin. Whenever we come to the meeting to fellowship with God&rsquo;s children, we must be clear that our standing is in Christ, in the new man, and in the Body. Our standing is not based on any class distinction.</p>
<p>Only Christians can break down all class distinctions, and only they can do it thoroughly. Only Christians can hold hands together and greet each other as brothers because only they have love. Only Christians&mdash;those who are in Christ&mdash;can remove all class distinctions. A young person must realize that as long as he is a believer in Christ, his Christian boss is his brother and his Christian subordinate is also his brother. His Christian master is his brother, and his Christian slave is also his brother. The distinction between the free man and the slave is annulled entirely; this distinction no longer exists. We can only fellowship with our brothers and sisters based on the little that the Lord has given us. We are all brothers and sisters. If we do this, we will be greatly blessed by the Lord, and the church will be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Several Christians in Chungking once wanted to build a church for the government officials. They came and asked me for my opinion. I said, &ldquo;What name are you going to give to this church? I think you should name it &lsquo;The Church of the Civil Officers.&rsquo;&rdquo; If it is a church of officers, surely it is not something in Christ, because there is no such thing in Christ. There is neither free man nor slave in Christ. If a free man wants to be saved, he has to receive the Lord&rsquo;s life. If a slave wants to be saved, he also must receive the Lord&rsquo;s life. There is no difference between the two. We cannot add anything to Christ or subtract anything from Christ. Man cannot build a church for officers, because there is no such thing in Christ. Everyone has to learn to be a brother or a sister.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE ANNULLING OF DISTINCTIONS<br />
BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE</h2>
<p>The fourth distinction that has been abolished in Christ is that of gender, that is, the distinction between male and female. In this world the male occupies one role and the female occupies another role. In church administration the male also has his place and the female her place. Within the family the husband has his place and the wife has her place. However, in Christ and in the new man, both the man and the woman have the same stand; there is no distinction between them.</p>
<p>In Christ, the man does not occupy a special place, nor does the woman, because Christ is all and in all. In this respect a man is no different from a woman. Please remember that in spiritual matters there is no distinction between male and female.</p>
<p>We have mentioned that the sisters&rsquo; place in some areas of service is different from that of the brothers. But this pertains only to the matter of authority. Today, in Christ, there is no difference between the two. A brother is saved through the life of Christ, the life of God&rsquo;s Son. In the same way, a sister is saved through the life of Christ, the life of God&rsquo;s Son. Every case in the Bible where the Chinese version translates &ldquo;sons and daughters,&rdquo; the original word is <em>children.</em> This word does not differentiate between male or female (even though its usage is masculine). I am born a child of God and grow up to be a son of God. A son is male. Yet this description fits both the brothers as well as the sisters.</p>
<p>In the whole New Testament, only 2 Corinthians 6:17-18 speaks of sons and daughters. &ldquo;Therefore &lsquo;come out from their midst...and I will welcome you&rsquo;; &lsquo;and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; After we have believed in God and are delivered and separated from the world and its polluted and unclean influence, God will receive us like a Father, and we will be His sons and His daughters. This is a matter between God and an individual; it is not a matter of what a person is in Christ. This is why it says <em>sons and daughters.</em> When a person suffers for God, incurs loss for His sake, and experiences hardship because of Him, God will become a Father to such a one as an individual. If you are male, God will receive you as a son. If you are female, God will receive you as a daughter. God will receive you as His sons and daughters. He is the all-sufficient Lord. He has everything. This is a matter of what a person is before God. It has nothing to do with what he or she is in Christ. In Christ, we are all God&rsquo;s children, and there is no distinction between male and female. This distinction does not exist at all.</p>
<p>Once I asked a certain craftsman in Shanghai, who was a brother in the Lord, &ldquo;Brother, how are the brothers in your place doing?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Are you asking about the male brothers or the female brothers?&rdquo; This answer could not have been put better. It is one of the truest words ever spoken. Male brothers are brothers and female brothers are also brothers; there is no distinction in Christ. What this brother said was absolutely correct; he was simply stating the biblical truth. When we come to the Lord and touch Him, we transcend all male and female distinctions. We are beyond gender. Before the Lord and in Christ, there is no distinction between male and female.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE ANNULLING OF ETHNIC DISTINCTIONS</h2>
<p>In the Bible there is another distinction between Greeks and Jews. The Jews are a very religious race, whereas the Greeks are a race that embraces philosophy and wisdom. Historically, when one speaks of religion, he thinks of the Jews, and when one speaks of philosophy, he thinks of the Greeks. All branches of sciences and philosophy in their primitive form come from the Greeks. Today, all scientific terms have their root in Greek. Hence, the Greeks symbolize wisdom. If one wants to talk about science and philosophy, he has to go to the Greeks. If one wants to talk about religion, he has to go to the Jews. These are distinctions in ethnicity.</p>
<p>People living in various parts of the world often have their own ethnic characteristics. For example, those who grow up in the south are more affectionate, while those who grow up in the north are more reserved. Southerners are generally more easygoing, while Northerners are generally more serious. People living in tropical regions like to dance and sing all day long, while Northerners, especially the northern Europeans, do not like to even jump. Instead they appear reserved and conservative. But the Southerners can be Christians as much as the Northerners can. Jews can be Christians, and Greeks also can be Christians. The wise can be Christians, and the religious can be Christians also.</p>
<p>In Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. Some people like to reason; they want to explain everything. Other people like to talk about the conscience. Does that mean that these are two different types of Christians? According to the flesh, these two are totally different. One walks by the intellect and the mind. Another walks impulsively by feelings. But in Christ, there is no distinction between the Greeks and the Jews. Not only are national distinctions gone; even ethnic distinctions are gone. A reserved person can be just as good a Christian as a warm person. Those who walk according to the mind can be Christians, and those who walk according to feelings can also be Christians. All kinds of people can be Christians.</p>
<p>Since all kinds of people can be Christians, one must learn to drop ethnic characteristics when he comes into the church. There is no such thing in the church life. Many problems arise in the church today because people bring their ethnic flavor into the church; they try to bring in their own distinctive characteristics. When the non-talkative people meet, they become a non-talkative group. When the talkative people meet, they become a talkative group. When those who are reserved come together, they become a reserved group. When those who are affectionate come together, they become an affectionate group. In this way, many distinctions are built up among God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Please remember that ethnicity does not exist in the church, in Christ, or in the new man. Do not condemn a person just because he has a different temperament than yours. You have to realize that others may not appreciate you that much either. You may feel that you always speak affectionately and wonder why others are so cold. But others may think you are talking too much; they may find your disposition intolerable.</p>
<p>Whether you are quick or quiet, cold or warm, intellectual or sentimental, as soon as you become a brother and enter the church life, you have to drop your disposition. Such things do not belong to the church. As soon as you introduce these natural elements into the church, they become standards for judgment and separation, and brothers will be divided. You will become the standard, and all those who are up to your standard will be considered good Christians, while all those who are not up to your standard will be considered poor Christians. You will become the standard. You will introduce your own nature, character, and temperament into the church. All confusion in the church issues from different human temperaments. Your silence is not necessarily good, nor is your talkativeness. Your reservation is not necessarily good, nor is your warmth. Your strong intellect may not necessarily be good, nor are your intense emotions. All these are distinctions outside of Christ. They are represented by the Greeks and the Jews. None of these natural dispositions can be brought into the church life.</p>
<p>A new believer must learn from the beginning to reject anything that comes from the old man. He should not say, &ldquo;This is the way I was.&rdquo; Many brothers shamelessly speak this way. We must tell them that we do not want their old person. They should not bring in their old person. That is not something in Christ, and we cannot create distinctions based on that. Such distinctions have to be totally abolished. In Christ, in the Body, and in the new man, these distinctions are totally annulled.</p>
<p>No brother or sister should carry his or her natural disposition into the church. As soon as you are saved, you have to leave these things behind. If you come to the church and contact the brothers and sisters, approving only those who agree with you and are up to your standard and disapproving those who disagree with you or are not up to your standard, you will bring confusion and division into the whole church. Throughout the years, the church has suffered damage through differences in dispositions. Never bring your dispositional differences into the church. Some people have a quick disposition, and they may say, &ldquo;I am quick, and I do not like anyone who is slow. God does not like those who are slow.&rdquo; Some people are slow by nature, and they may say, &ldquo;I am steady by nature, and I do not like anyone who is quick.&rdquo; But neither quickness nor slowness should be in the church life to divide God&rsquo;s children. The moment you bring these things in, you make yourself the standard. The Greeks want the Jews to repent, and the Jews want the Greeks to repent. But God wants to set both aside. There is nothing else but Christ.</p>
<p>If a new believer upholds this principle from the very beginning, the church will be spared much hardship. We must never discriminate according to our character. We must reject the things that belong to the old man. We should walk in the same footsteps as all the other children of God.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE ANNULLING OF CULTURAL DISTINCTIONS</h2>
<p>The book of Colossians speaks of two kinds of peoples&mdash; barbarians and Scythians. These two names have posed a problem to Bible scholars. In English a barbarian means a savage, an uncivilized person. But what is a Scythian? This word comes from the Greek word <em>Zema,</em> which became <em>Zecotha,</em> then <em>Zecothia,</em> and then <em>Zecothian.</em></p>
<p>Mr. Wescott said that <em>Zecothia</em> was the name of a place. In ancient Greek literature, Zecothians and Galatians were often mentioned together. Hence, the Zecothians were a respectable people. Like the names of many cities, the word <em>Zecothians</em> brings a certain image to mind as soon as it is mentioned. For example, when Shansi is mentioned, one thinks of those who deal with money because most of the people from Shansi are businessmen. When Shao-Shing is mentioned, one thinks of court secretaries during the Ching dynasty. The name of a place often conjures up associated images.</p>
<p>If you consult Greek literature, you will see that the Scythians were a respected people, while the barbarians were a despised people. This is a matter of culture. Culture creates a big distinction in the world. If you put a typical English gentleman beside an African native, the difference in culture will become very obvious. However, Paul tells us that barbarian and Scythian alike must abolish all distinctions.</p>
<p>This cultural distinction has brought in frustration for many people. Once I met two Jews. Because I knew both of them quite well, I asked them frankly, &ldquo;Why do so many people in the world hate Jews?&rdquo; One said, &ldquo;Our Jewish culture does not conform to the standard of others.&rdquo; That was the first time I heard such an answer. I did not understand what he meant. He went on to explain, &ldquo;Consider the case of an American Jew. Honestly speaking, if I were a non-Jewish American, I would not like American Jews either. I would despise the Jewish culture. If an American earns two hundred dollars a month, he spends a certain portion of it on food and rent. He polishes his shoes and changes his shirt daily. Once every two months he buys a pair of new shoes and keeps his house neat and clean. He is happy if he has ten dollars left in his pocket at the end of the month. But the Jews are different. A Jew who makes the same amount of money spends only ten dollars a month and saves the rest. He calculates how much he can save if he does not polish his shoes or buy new ones. He can tolerate a dirty shirt to save on soap. Unlike the American who is so particular about his creature comfort, the Jew is not particular about food or lodging. All he wants is an ever-growing savings account in the bank. We Jews look down on Americans because they are so poor. Americans look down on us because they think we do not care for personal grooming and living conditions.&rdquo; He went on to say, &ldquo;We Jews are good at making money. We are good with our brains but not with fashion. We cannot get along too well with others. This is why no one likes us.&rdquo; That was the first time I heard such an answer.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person with a polished culture to see eye to eye with one who has a seemingly unpolished culture. This is a matter not of class, intellect, or financial status, but of culture. From a Scythian&rsquo;s point of view, nothing about a barbarian is right. A barbarian is wrong in the way he dresses, eats, and lives. From a barbarian&rsquo;s point of view, a Scythian is too hedonistic. He is too particular about food and clothing. These two persons have two totally different perspectives. If both of them come to the church, each will bring his own opinion along and consider the other wrong. When they come together, there is bound to be a clash. They can never be one with each other.</p>
<p>The Chinese eat with chopsticks, while the Indians eat with their fingers. Put them together at the same table for a few meals and both will feel uneasy at heart. They may not say much. But leave them together for two days and they will not be able to stand each other; they will start to quarrel. One may feel that chopsticks should be used because it is unsightly to eat with one&rsquo;s fingers, and the other may feel that eating with chopsticks is merely for show and that one can truly enjoy his meal when he eats with his fingers. One will say that the other is wrong and vice versa. This is a difference in culture. Such cultural differences present a real barrier. But even this is abolished in Christ. Those who are in Christ should be the most accommodating persons. They can tolerate all kinds of human differences. A man in Christ does not set up a standard and demand that everyone else to come up to his standard. He does not respect only those who come up to his standard and despise those who do not. This is not how a person in Christ should behave. This kind of behavior does not belong in the church or in the new man. Suppose some brothers among us come from India or Africa. Their cultures are different from ours. But we should ask only one question: Are they in the Lord or not? They should ask us the same question: Are we in the Lord or not? If we are in Christ, all problems will be settled immediately. When we contact each other in Christ and love one another in Christ, there is nothing that cannot be tolerated. We should not allow anything to come between God&rsquo;s children, to differentiate the brothers and sisters in Christ from one another.</p>
<p>We cannot group the sophisticated brothers and sisters together to form a church. We cannot group the unsophisticated ones together to form another church. That would not be the church. Such things are not in the church. They belong outside the church, outside the Body, and outside the new man. We must never bring such problems into the church. All cultural differences have been abolished in the church.</p>
<p>However, we must learn to &ldquo;live as Romans among Romans&rdquo; and be under the law among those who are under the law. Whatever kind of culture we are in, we do as others do. If some African brothers come to China, and they have the knowledge of God, they should use chopsticks. If we go to Africa, we may have to eat with our hands. We do not want to come into conflict with the local brothers and sisters. When we go to them, we must learn to live among them. When they come to us, they must learn to live among us. When we go to England, we must learn to behave like the Englishmen, and when an Englishman comes to China, he must learn to behave like the Chinese. If we do not do this, we will stumble others, and they will not be won to Christ. If God&rsquo;s children have a good start in this matter, they will avoid much trouble later on.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE ANNULLING OF MARKS OF PIETY<br />
IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>The last distinction spoken of in Colossians is the distinction between the circumcised and the uncircumcised. This speaks of the distinction of outward marks of piety. We know that the Jews are circumcised with a mark on their bodies, indicating that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they deny the flesh. In doing so they put themselves under God&rsquo;s covenant and become a part of God&rsquo;s covenant.</p>
<p>Many people (specifically the Jews) love circumcision. They think that only those who are circumcised are under God&rsquo;s covenant, while those who are not circumcised are not under His covenant. A Jew cannot marry an uncircumcised person. Acts 15 says that even the believing Gentiles were forced to be circumcised. The Jews paid much attention to this mark of piety in the flesh.</p>
<p>Today we can fall into the same pitfall as the Jews, paying too much attention to external signs. For example, I may be baptized by immersion while a certain brother may be sprinkled instead of immersed. God&rsquo;s Word tells us that we should be baptized by immersion. It is true that a brother should be baptized by immersion. However, if I consider myself to be better than my brother, who is not baptized by immersion, then I have made baptism by immersion a mark of piety. I have, in effect, claimed that in one thing in the flesh I am better than my brother. If I consider my brother wrong in the eyes of the Lord because he has not gone through an outward immersion, I have made baptism by immersion a cause of separation.</p>
<p>Head covering carries a spiritual significance to the sisters. However, it can become a mark in the flesh. The breaking of bread has a spiritual significance. But it can also become a mark in the flesh. The laying on of hands has a spiritual significance, but it can become a mark in the flesh as well. These things indeed carry much spiritual significance. But if they are used to separate God&rsquo;s children, they will lose their spiritual significance and become mere marks of the flesh. In reality they will become something similar to circumcision.</p>
<p>Please do not try to misunderstand me. Instead, try to understand what I am saying. Do not think that we disagree with baptism by immersion, the breaking of bread, the head covering, or the laying on of hands. I am trying to show you that once you separate God&rsquo;s children by these things, you are making distinctions according to the flesh. In Christ there is no circumcision and uncircumcision. Physical symbols must not be used to separate God&rsquo;s children. In Christ we are one. The life that is in Christ is one. It is good for something with spiritual reality to have a physical symbol as well. However, if a person has the spiritual reality of something but is unconcerned about its physical symbol, we should not isolate him because of this. In short, God&rsquo;s children should not allow physical symbols to damage the oneness that they have in Christ.</p>
<p>It is true that some of God&rsquo;s children do not have an accurate view concerning certain things. But as long as they have the spiritual reality, we should be satisfied with our spiritual oneness and should not insist on the symbols. For example, a sister may be very submissive before the Lord and before the brothers; she knows where she stands before the Lord and before the brothers. If she is short only of a sign on her head, we should not ostracize her. The moment we separate God&rsquo;s children, we damage the oneness.</p>
<p>Paul stated quite clearly that circumcision is not for the purification of fleshly blemishes but for the removal of fleshly activities. In the eyes of God, what counts is the inward reality, not the outward things. If the inward revelation is the same, one should not make separations based on outward differences. If a person has neither the inward reality nor the outward sign, that is not our concern. If a sister does not take the place of submission, or if a brother&rsquo;s baptism is not a separation from the world or a burial and resurrection with the Lord, he or she is too far off from the truth. In such cases the responsibility does not rest on us. But if a person sees baptism as one&rsquo;s burial and resurrection with Christ, yet holds a slightly different view in the matter of the outward signs, we cannot damage the oneness because of this slight difference. You cannot set yourselves apart from others just because you are obedient to the Lord with respect to certain physical symbols. It is wrong to separate God&rsquo;s children according to these things.</p>
<p>We are all brothers and sisters. In Christ we are a new man. We are fellow members in the Body. In the church we have annulled all distinctions outside of Christ. Everyone stands on a new ground. Everyone is in the one new man that the Lord has established and in the one Body which the Lord has created. We must see that all of God&rsquo;s children are one. We cannot look upon anyone with a special frame of mind. We must thoroughly eradicate denominationalism and sectarianism from our heart. If we do this, we will have taken another step forward.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">READING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Psa. 119:9-11, 15, 105, 140, 148</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Every Christian should read the Bible because it is &ldquo;God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:16). It shows us many things that God has done for us and the way He has led men in the past. If we want to know the riches and vastness of God&rsquo;s provision for us, we must read the Bible. If we want to see God&rsquo;s step-by-step guidance for men, we must read the Bible as well.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking to man today is based upon what He has already spoken in the past. God rarely speaks things which He has not already spoken in the Bible. Even though a person may be quite advanced in his spiritual walk, God&rsquo;s revelation to him will still be confined to the words that He has spoken in the Bible. Hence, God&rsquo;s speaking today is merely a repetition of His own word. If a person does not know what God has spoken in the past, it is difficult for him to receive His revelation in the present because he lacks the basis for God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Moreover, if God wants to speak something to others through us, He will also do it on the basis of what He has spoken in the past. If we do not know what God has said in the past, He cannot speak through us to others, and we are useless in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>This is why we need to let the word of God dwell in us richly. By letting His word dwell in us richly, we know His past ways and hear His present speaking. Only then can God use us to speak to others.</p>
<p>The Bible is a great book. It is a monumental work. Even if we spent our whole life on the Bible, we could only touch a part of its riches. It is impossible for a person to understand the Bible without spending time to study it. Every young Christian should do his best to labor on God&rsquo;s Word so that when he grows old, he can nourish himself and supply others with the riches of the Word.</p>
<p>Everyone who wants to know God must study His Word in a serious way, and every believer should realize the importance of reading God&rsquo;s Word from the very beginning of his Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BASIC PRINCIPLES IN READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There are four basic principles in reading the Bible: (1) Discover the facts, (2) memorize and recite the words, (3) analyze, categorize, and make comparisons, and (4) receive God&rsquo;s enlightening.</p>
<p>We must follow the sequence of these four steps when we read the Bible. We cannot jump from the third to the first step or from the first to the third step. First, discover the facts in the Bible. Second, memorize these facts. We must know and memorize God&rsquo;s Word accurately and exactly. We cannot afford to leave out or ignore any portion. If we do, our reading will profit little. Third, analyze, categorize, and make comparisons with the facts. After we have analyzed the facts accurately, categorized them properly, and compared them clearly before God, we will have the ground to take on the fourth point&mdash;God&rsquo;s enlightening.</p>
<p>The Bible contains many facts that are spiritual in nature. When a man&rsquo;s inner eyes are blind, he cannot see these facts. But once he discovers these biblical facts, half of the light contained in the Word will be his. God&rsquo;s enlightening is just His shining upon the facts that are recorded in His Word. Discovering the facts is half of our job in reading the Bible. When we read the Bible, the first thing we have to do is discover these facts.</p>
<p>For example, gravity is a fact. The law of gravity existed long before Newton, yet for thousands of years no one discovered it. One day, an apple fell on Newton while he was asleep under a tree. Through this he <em>discovered</em> the law of gravity. There is no question about the existence of facts. The question is whether or not these facts have been discovered.</p>
<p>For example, the Bible mentions something in some places and does not mention it in other places. One place mentions one thing while another place skips it. One place says it one way while another place says it a different way. The same word can be in the plural form in one place and in the singular form in another. Sometimes the Bible emphasizes the Lord&rsquo;s name while at other times it emphasizes a man&rsquo;s name. Chronology is clearly mentioned in some places, but totally skipped and seemingly neglected in other places. These are all facts.</p>
<p>A person who is good at reading the Bible is surely a careful person before God. He cannot be sloppy or muddled. Every iota or serif of the Bible is unalterable. God&rsquo;s Word says it, and it is so. The moment God&rsquo;s Word is opened up, you should know what its emphasis is. Many people are very careless. They listen to men&rsquo;s words carelessly and read God&rsquo;s Word carelessly. They do not see what God&rsquo;s Word emphasizes and are ignorant of the depths in His Word. The first thing a person has to do is discover the facts. Afterwards, he has to memorize these facts and analyze, categorize, and compare them. Only then will he receive light from the Lord. In this way he will get the supply and also supply others. He will receive nourishment and also nourish others.</p>
<p>Here I will give a simple illustration. If we read the Bible carefully, we will find the New Testament expressions <em>in the Lord,in Christ,in Christ Jesus,</em> etc. It never says <em>in Jesus</em> or <em>in Jesus Christ.</em> It only <em></em> says <em>in Christ Jesus,</em> not <em>in Jesus Christ.</em> These are facts. We must memorize and jot down these facts one by one. Find where it says <em>in the Lord</em> and what the context is. Find where it says <em>in Christ</em> and what the context is. Find yet another place where it says <em>in Christ Jesus</em> and what the context is. If we know all these portions by heart, we can compare them. Why does it say <em>in Christ</em> in one instance instead of <em>in Jesus</em> ? Why does one place say <em>in Christ Jesus</em> and not <em>in Jesus Christ</em> ? Why does the Bible never say <em>in Jesus</em> or <em>in Jesus Christ</em> ? What is the reason for this? When we analyze and compare the Scriptures in this way, looking to God for enlightenment, we will see something.</p>
<p>Once the light comes, everything will become very clear. <em>Jesus</em> is the name given to the Lord while He was on earth. <em>Christ</em> is the name given to Him after His resurrection when God anointed Him. &ldquo;God has made Him both Lord and Christ.&rdquo; Do you remember these words in Acts 2? Christ is the name given to Him in His resurrection. In reading Romans we find the words <em>Christ Jesus,</em> which mean that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth in the past. Christ Jesus is His name today. This means that the Christ today is the very Jesus who was on earth before. His name before resurrection was <em>Jesus Christ.</em> This name implies that Jesus would one day be the Christ. <em>Jesus</em> was His name when He lived on earth as a man. These two expressions&mdash;Christ being once Jesus, and Jesus eventually becoming Christ&mdash;mean two different things. Moreover, we can only be in <em>Christ,</em> not in <em>Jesus.</em> We can only be in <em>the Lord</em> and in <em>Christ Jesus,</em> not in <em>Jesus Christ.</em> When the Lord was on earth, we could not be in Him. If we had been in Him when He was on earth, we would have taken part in His cross and His redemption. This is contrary to the truth. We have no part in His incarnation at Bethlehem. He was the only begotten Son of God, and we have no part in that.</p>
<p>How then can we be in Christ? First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;But of Him [God] you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; It does not say <em>in Jesus.</em> After the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, we became joined to Him in His resurrection. Through His death and resurrection, God has made Him the Christ, and God has joined us to Him through the Spirit. We received His life at the time of His resurrection. Regeneration does not come through incarnation but through resurrection. Now we should be clear.</p>
<p>This is the way to read the Bible. This is how we study the Bible. First, discover the facts. Then memorize, analyze, categorize, and compare these facts. After this pray to the Lord and wait on Him; He will enlighten you and give you sight. These are the four principles of reading the Bible. We cannot skip any one of them.</p>
<p>Let us give another illustration. Consider the word about the coming of the Holy Spirit in John 14 and 15. In reading these passages, we must pay attention to the promise of the Lord Jesus and discover whether there are any special facts related to it.</p>
<p>John 14:16-20 says, &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; What facts can we discover here? These sentences first use <em>He</em> or <em>Him</em> but later change to <em>I.</em> There is a change in pronoun. Here is a fact: The words <em>He</em> and <em>Him</em> have been changed to <em>I.</em></p>
<p>According to the four principles of reading the Bible, how should we deal with this passage? First, we should discover the facts. In this case, the pronoun change from <em>He</em> to <em>I</em> is a fact. Second, we must remember this fact. Third, we must analyze this fact. Here are two Comforters. The Lord says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He [the Father] will give you another Comforter.&rdquo; The word <em>another</em> in the expression <em>another Comforter</em> means this is the second one. &ldquo;And He [the Father] will give you another Comforter.&rdquo; This means that the Father will give a second Comforter. If there is a second Comforter, there must be a first Comforter.</p>
<p>The first thing we can ascertain is that the Lord is speaking of two Comforters. The Lord said that the disciples already had one Comforter, but that He was going to give them another. What kind of Comforter is the second? &ldquo;That He may be with you forever.&rdquo; Who is the <em>He</em>? The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The world...does not...know Him; but you know Him.&rdquo; Why? &ldquo;Because He abides with you.&rdquo; He was with them all the time. The world cannot receive Him and has not even seen Him. What about them? The disciples had seen Him; they knew Him. They knew Him because He was abiding with them all the time.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; After this point the pronoun <em>He</em> is no longer used. In the next sentence the Lord said, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; In studying this, we find that <em>He</em> is <em>I,</em> and <em>I</em> is <em>He.</em> In other words, while the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He was the Comforter. The Holy Spirit was in the Lord, and the Lord was the Comforter. When the Lord was on earth, the Holy Spirit was in Him; He and the Holy Spirit were one. This is why He said that the disciples beheld Him and knew Him and that He was with them.</p>
<p>But then what happened? The Lord went on to tell them that another Comforter would come. Following His death and resurrection, the Lord said that He would come back to them and that God would give them the Holy Spirit. But how was this to be accomplished? The Lord Himself would come to them again in the Holy Spirit. He did not leave them orphans. After a little while they would see Him no longer, but then they would see Him again, and He would abide in them. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;He...in you.&rdquo; Then verse 20 says, &ldquo;I in you.&rdquo; Thus, the <em>I</em> in the second section is the <em>He</em> in the first section. Once we see the change in pronouns, we see the difference in the two Comforters. The first section refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ. The second section refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit. <em>He</em> refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ. <em>I</em> refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit. Who is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus in another form. The Son is the Father in another form. In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the Son in another form. There is only a change in form.</p>
<p>From this example we see that the first basic principle in reading the Bible is to discover the facts. If we cannot discover any facts, we cannot expect to receive any light from God. It is not a question of how many times we have read the Bible, but a question of the facts we have discovered through our many times of reading.</p>
<p>Paul was a person who knew how to discover facts. Consider what he said in Galatians 3. He saw from Genesis that God would bless the nations through the seed of Abraham. God used the word <em>seed</em> in its singular form, not in its plural form. This refers to Christ. First, Paul discovered this fact. He saw that the nations would be blessed through the seed of Abraham, and he saw that this was a unique seed. From this he realized that this seed referred to Christ. If it had been plural, it would have referred to the many children of Abraham, that is, the Jews, and the meaning would be completely different. Paul read the Scripture thoroughly and discovered the facts.</p>
<p>In the Bible there are many facts. Whether or not a person is rich in God&rsquo;s Word depends on how many facts he has discovered. The more facts he discovers, the richer he becomes. If he cannot discover any facts and if he reads through the Bible in a hasty and mindless way, he will not understand much.</p>
<p>In reading the Bible, we must learn to discover the facts. After this we should memorize, analyze, and compare these facts. Finally, we should kneel down before God and ask for light.</p><h2 class="head1">III. DIFFERENT WAYS TO READ THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We should read our Bible during two different periods of time. We should have two copies of the Bible for these two occasions. One period can be in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Or we can do both early in the morning by reading one way during the first half of our time and another way during the second half of our time. These two periods of time must be separate. In the morning period or the first half of the early morning reading, we should meditate, praise, and pray as we read the Word, mixing our reading with meditation, praise, and prayer. This period of reading is for receiving spiritual food and for strengthening our spirit. Do not read too much during this time; three or four verses is sufficient. The afternoon time, or the second half of the early morning reading, should be longer. During this time, we should read for the purpose of learning more about God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>If possible, we should have two Bibles. The Bible used in the first period should not have any marks or notes written in it (except dates, which we will mention later). The Bible used in the second period can contain whatever we have been touched with, either by jotting down notes or by circling or underlining words or passages. The Bible used in the first period can contain dates&mdash;dates on which we came across a special verse, made a deal with the Lord, or had a special experience. We should write down the date next to such a verse, indicating that we met God through this verse on that date. Do not write down anything other than dates. The Bible used in the second period is for understanding, and we should write down all the spiritual facts we discover and the light we have received. Now let us discuss the way to read the Bible during these two periods of time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Meditating on the Word<br />
during the First Period of Time</h2>
<p>Concerning meditating on the Word, I think the best thing is for me to quote George M&#252;ller. He said:</p>
<p class="indent1">It has recently pleased the Lord to teach me a truth, irrespective of human instrumentality, as far as I know, the benefit of which I have not lost, though now, while preparing the fifth edition for the press, more than fourteen years have since passed away. The point is this: I saw more clearly than ever that the first great and primary business to which I ought to attend every day was, to have my soul happy in the Lord. The first thing to be concerned about was not how much I might serve the Lord, how I might glorify the Lord; but how I might get my soul into a happy state, and how my inner man might be nourished. For I might seek to set the truth before the unconverted, I might seek to benefit believers, I might seek to relieve the distressed, I might in other ways seek to behave myself as it becomes a child of God in this world; and yet, not being happy in the Lord, and not being nourished and strengthened in my inner man day by day, all this might not be attended to in a right spirit. Before this time my practice had been, at least for ten years previously, as an habitual thing to give myself to in prayer, after having dressed myself in the morning. <em>Now,</em> I saw that the most important thing I had to do was to give myself to the reading of the word of God, and to meditation on it, that thus my heart might be comforted, encouraged, warned, reproved, instructed; and that thus, by means of the word of God, whilst meditating on it, my heart might be brought into experimental communion with the Lord.</p>
<p class="indent1">I began therefore to meditate on the New Testament from the beginning, early in the morning. The first thing I did, after having asked in a few words the Lord&rsquo;s blessing upon his precious word, was, to begin to meditate on the word of God, searching as it were into every verse, to get blessing out of it; not for the sake of the public ministry of the word, not for the sake of preaching on what I had meditated upon, but for the sake of obtaining food for my own soul. The result I have found to be almost invariably this, that after a very few minutes my soul has been led to confession, or to thanksgiving, or to intercession, or to supplication; so that, though I did not, as it were, give myself to <em>prayer,</em> but to <em>meditation,</em> yet it turned almost immediately more or less into prayer. When thus I have been for a while making confession, or intercession, or supplication, or have given thanks, I go on to the next words or verse, turning all, as I go on, into prayer for myself or others, as the word may lead to it, but still continually keeping before me that food for my own soul is the object of my meditation. The result of this is, that there is always a good deal of confession, thanksgiving, supplication, or intercession mingled with my meditation, and that my inner man almost invariably is even sensibly nourished and strengthened, and that by breakfast time, with rare exceptions, I am in a peaceful if not happy state of heart. Thus also the Lord is pleased to communicate unto me that which, either very soon after or at a later time, I have found to become food for other believers, though it was not for the sake of the public ministry of the word that I gave myself to meditation, but for the profit of my own inner man....</p>
<p class="indent1">And yet now, since God has taught me this point, it is as plain to me as anything, that the first thing the child of God has to do morning by morning is, to <em>obtain food for his inner man.</em> As the outward man is not fit for work for any length of time except we take food, and as this is one of the first things we do in the morning, so it should be with the inner man. We should take food for that, as every one must allow. Now what is the food for the inner man? Not <em>prayer,</em> but <em>the word of God;</em> and here again, not the simple reading of the word of God, so that it only passes through our minds, just as water runs through a pipe, but considering what we read, pondering over it, and applying it to our hearts. When we pray, we speak to God. Now, prayer, in order to be continued for any length of time in any other than a formal manner, requires, generally speaking, a measure of strength or godly desire, and the season, therefore, when this exercise of the soul can be most effectually performed is after the inner man has been nourished by meditation on the word of God, where we find our Father speaking to us, to encourage us, to comfort us, to instruct us, to humble us, to reprove us. We may therefore profitably meditate, with God&rsquo;s blessing, though we are ever so weak spiritually; nay, the weaker we are, the more we need meditation for the strengthening of our inner man. There is thus far less to be feared from wandering of mind than if we give ourselves to prayer without having had previously time for meditation. I dwell so particularly on this point because of the immense spiritual profit and refreshment I am conscious of having derived from it myself, and I affectionately and solemnly beseech all my fellow-believers to ponder this matter. By the blessing of God I ascribe to this mode the help and strength which I had had from God to pass in peace through deeper trials, in various ways, than I had ever had before; and after having now above fourteen years tried this way, I can most fully, in the fear of God, commend it....</p>
<p class="indent1">How different, when the soul is refreshed and made happy early in the morning, from what it is when, without spiritual preparation, the service, the trials, and the temptations of the day come upon one!&mdash;George M&#252;ller, <em>Autobiography of George M&#252;ller, the Life of Trust,</em> 1861, reprinted 1981, pp. 206-10.</p><h2 class="head2">B. General Reading<br />
during the Second Period of Time</h2>
<p>A new believer who recently has received the Lord should not engage himself in intense research of the Bible for at least six months because he is not familiar with the Bible as a whole yet. He should rather spend a few months to read through the whole Bible and familiarize himself with it in a general way. After this he can begin serious study of the Bible.</p>
<p>In familiarizing himself with the Bible, he should read the whole book chapter by chapter, consecutively over and over again. The best way is to decide the number of chapters in the Old and the New Testament one wants to read each day. The reading should neither be too fast nor too slow. It should be regular, continuous, and general in nature. George M&#252;ller read the Old and New Testament a hundred times during his lifetime. Those who have just received the Lord should learn to read the Bible and remember the number of times they have read through it. It is good to write a letter to notify a more elderly brother the first time you have finished reading through the New Testament. It is also good to leave a blank page in your Bible to record the number of times you have read through it. You should write the date and the place you finished reading it the first time, the second time, and so on. Each time you finish reading it, you should mark down the occasion. Identify clearly whether it is the Old Testament or the New Testament you have read through. I hope that you, like Mr. M&#252;ller, can read through the Bible a hundred times during your lifetime. If a person wants to read through the Bible a hundred times, assuming that he lives for fifty years as a Christian, he will have to go through the whole Bible at least twice a year. You can see why you need to spend much time to read the Bible.</p>
<p>The principle of reading the Bible is to go through it chapter by chapter, over and over again. Those who are more advanced in the Lord should pay attention to the way the newly saved ones read their Bibles. Sometimes it does good to examine the dates recorded in their Bibles, to check how many chapters they read every day, and to find out where they are each week. We should all pay attention to this work and should not slacken. We should remind those who are progressing too slowly, &ldquo;Half a year has past. How come you have not finished reading the New Testament once yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a person reads his Bible according to the above way, after some time his knowledge of the Bible will increase. If possible, one should try to memorize one or two verses each day. In the beginning, a person may have to force himself a little to do this. It may come as quite a dull chore. But after some time he will reap the benefit of it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Intense Study<br />
during a Specifically Apportioned Time</h2>
<p>The first kind of daily Bible reading&mdash;praying and meditating over the Word&mdash;is a continuous lifelong practice. The second kind of reading&mdash;general reading, involving some kind of Bible study&mdash;can begin after at least six months are spent gaining some knowledge of the Bible.</p>
<p>Every Christian should have a definite plan of studying the Bible. If you can set aside half an hour a day, develop a plan to study the Bible for half an hour a day. If you can afford an hour each day, develop a plan that includes an hour of study. Whatever time you can afford, make a plan that will fit your schedule. The worst way to read is by &ldquo;inspiration,&rdquo; that is, casual, unplanned reading that begins at whatever page one feels, at times reading voraciously for ten days and at other times not reading anything for ten days. This is the wrong way. We should not adopt this &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; method. Everyone should have a definite plan of reading. In reading the Bible, we need to be restricted and disciplined.</p>
<p>However, do not set too high a standard or too long a time for yourself. If you set too long a time, it will be hard to maintain the schedule. This is worse than having no plan at all. Once you decide to do something, stick to it for five years, ten years, or fifteen years. Do not stop after two, three, five, or six months. This is why you should consider carefully before the Lord the amount of time you should set aside for your study. One hour each day should be quite sufficient. Half an hour may be too short; one may not get much done in half an hour. Of course, if time does not allow you to have an hour, half an hour is still good. One hour, however, is the optimum period of time. If one can afford two hours, it is good. Normally, there is no need to spend more than two hours. We have not seen a brother or sister who studies for three hours a day who can maintain this schedule for long.</p>
<p>There are twenty-eight different ways to study the Bible, which are covered in the book <em>The Ways to Study the Bible.</em> Of the twenty-eight ways, the study of the progression of truth throughout the Bible is the most difficult. For many people, this method should not be attempted until a much later time. The method of word study is a much easier approach. One can also study metals, minerals, numbers, names of persons, geography, etc. These can be supplementary studies; we do not have to devote all our time to these special ways. There are also the chronologies in the Bible. If we have the time, we can take a look at them. Besides these, there are other ways to study the Bible, like studying prophecies, types, parables, miracles, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on earth, or doing a book-by-book study, etc. We should go through all these methods one by one.</p>
<p>Let us assume for now that a person has one hour a day to study the Bible. He can allocate his time in the following way:</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. First Twenty Minutes&mdash;Studying by Subjects</h2>
<p>The experience of some people suggests that an hour of study can be divided into four sessions. The first session of twenty minutes is for studying specific subjects like prophecies, types, parables, dispensations, the Lord&rsquo;s teachings on earth, or a specific book. One can read all the related passages and find the verses that deal with the subject chosen. If one is trying to study one book at a time, he should select the book he wants to study. He may choose Romans or the Gospel of John. After he finishes one book, he should go on to the next. He should study the whole book and find out the content of each book. If you decide to dedicate twenty minutes of your time each day to this kind of study, do not prolong or shorten it. We must learn to restrict ourselves and never be a careless or loose person.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Second Twenty Minutes&mdash;Word Study</h2>
<p>The second twenty minutes can be used for word study. There are many special terms like <em>reconciliation, blood, faith, joy, peace,hope, love, obedience, righteousness, redemption, mercy, etc.,</em> which are scattered throughout the Bible, and they all are very meaningful. If they are grouped and compiled together, we can get a better grasp of their meaning. For example, we may study the word <em>blood.</em> First, we should jot down all the chapters and verses that mention the blood. Then we should analyze the meaning of each occurrence. What has the blood done for us before God? What type of persons does the blood deal with? What and how much has the blood accomplished for us? In the Old and New Testament, we can find many verses which speak of the blood. We can analyze them all. This cannot be accomplished in one sitting. One cannot hope to see much result on the first day. If he has access to a concordance, he can save much labor.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Third Ten Minutes&mdash;Gathering Information</h2>
<p>One can choose specific topics and spend the next ten minutes solely gathering information concerning them. There are many topics in the Bible, such as creation, man, sin, salvation, repentance, the Holy Spirit, regeneration, sanctification, justification, forgiveness, freedom, the Body of Christ, the Lord&rsquo;s coming, judgment, the kingdom, eternity, etc. You can choose certain topics and then gather information about them from the Bible. The most one can handle at one time is five topics; if there are more than five topics, there will be too many clues, and it will be difficult to handle them all at once. Do not gather material for one topic alone; this is too time consuming. One may find material for more than one topic in a chapter. For example, you may be studying about the Holy Spirit. But the particular chapter you are on may not have anything on the Holy Spirit. But you can definitely find other topics in the same chapter. It is not a bad idea to gather information on two, three, four, or five topics at the same time. But do not take more than five at one time.</p>
<p>Each topic may require some time to complete its study. Every day you have to add more material to your study. Write down all the materials (verses) you have gathered, and from these write down the main words and meanings of each passage. It is useless to merely jot down the verses. You must know what the verses are saying. Suppose you are studying the Holy Spirit in Ephesians. In writing down &ldquo;sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo; in 1:13, you should also write down the meaning of the word <em>seal.</em> First, write down the verse, then the related terms, and finally the meaning of the verse. You should gather all the information this way. One day when you need to deal with such a topic, these materials will be on hand for you to apply.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Fourth Ten Minutes&mdash;Paraphrasing</h2>
<p>The final ten minutes can be used to paraphrase the Bible. This exercise is very useful. Paraphrasing the Bible gives fresh insight into a passage. By paraphrasing the Bible with simple words, we express a passage in a way that others can understand at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, you may be doing a chapter-by-chapter study of the book of Romans. If a teenager comes and says, &ldquo;I have read Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans, but I cannot understand it,&rdquo; you will have to think of some ways to explain this book to him using your own words. A paraphrase is not a commentary; you are merely using your own words to convey what Paul said so that those who do not understand it can understand. In order to do this, you have to learn to paraphrase the Bible with your own words. Take the book of Romans and try to paraphrase it with your own words. Paul wrote the Epistles in his words. Now you should try to write the same thing in your own words. Try your best to do this. Do it properly and intelligently so that you can understand it and so that other brothers and sisters who read it can understand it as well.</p>
<p>Such paraphrasing will show how well we know the Scriptures. Using our own words to reiterate the apostles&rsquo; thought is a good way to prepare us for biblical exposition. Paraphrasing is the first step; exposition is the second step. First we should learn to paraphrase the text of the Bible with our own words. Our training before God must be in the proper order. Do not try to expound the Bible before learning to paraphrase it; this is too hasty. Learn to paraphrase the Bible first and then learn to expound it. If we cannot paraphrase the Bible well, it is impossible for us to expound it well. We must paraphrase first and then expound. We must all learn this basic lesson. First, paraphrase Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, then paraphrase the remainder of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In paraphrasing the Bible, try to avoid using the words of the Bible. Use your own words instead. The main lesson to learn here is to express the meaning of a passage with words that are within your grasp. After you have tried one book, you will know how precious the experience is and how profitable the exercise is. A careless and sloppy person cannot paraphrase the Bible. You must pray much before the Lord and read the Bible properly before you can paraphrase it correctly. After you finish a book, go back and revise your work once or twice, modifying it with appropriate words and polishing your sentences. This will give you a better impression of the book, and you will come to know what the apostles were talking about. You need to paraphrase a passage before you can have a deep impression of it.</p>
<p>In order to paraphrase the Bible, one must first study it thoroughly. He must understand what a passage says and what is implied in the passage. He can then incorporate all his knowledge into his paraphrase. This requires a thorough understanding of a verse. A person can only paraphrase the Bible when he has a clear grasp of what it says. Through practicing a little every day, and through careful reading and meticulous writing, one will eventually be able to paraphrase one of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. He will then be able to understand Paul&rsquo;s word and will be able to use other words to convey the same meaning.</p>
<p>We have mentioned four things already. First, study by topic; second, do a word study; third, gather information; and fourth, paraphrase. We should go through all twenty-eight methods one by one. A definite schedule of Bible study is an exercise for us. We must gird up our loins, be restricted and regulated before the Lord, and not be loose. If we have made up our mind to study for an hour, keep this hour. We should not shorten or lengthen the time, unless we are sick or on vacation. Other than such exceptions, we should always keep our schedule. If we persist in this exercise daily, we will soon reap the harvest.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:24; James 4:2-3; Luke 11:9-10; Psa. 66:18; Mark 11:24; Luke 18:1-8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. PRAYER BEING A BASIC CHRISTIAN RIGHT</h2>
<p>Christians have a basic right while living on earth today, the right to receive answers to prayers. The moment a person is regenerated, God gives him the basic right to ask of Him and to be heard by Him. John 16 says that God answers when we ask in the name of the Lord so that our joy may be made full. If we pray without ceasing, we will live a Christian life that is full of joy on earth today.</p>
<p>If we unceasingly pray, yet God does not unceasingly answer our prayer, or if we have been a Christian for years and God hardly or never listens to our prayers, there must be something seriously wrong. If we have been a Christian for three to five years without receiving one answer to prayer, we are ineffectual Christians. We are not just a little ineffectual, but very ineffectual. We are children of God, yet our prayers are never answered! This should never be. Every Christian should experience God answering his prayers. Every Christian should have frequent experiences of prayers being answered. This is a basic experience. If God has not answered our prayers for a long time, it means that there is surely something wrong with us. There is no way to deceive ourselves in the matter of answers to prayer. If it is answered, it is answered. If it is not answered, it is not answered. If it is effectual, it is effectual. If it is ineffectual, it is ineffectual.</p>
<p>We would like to ask every Christian: Have you learned to pray? Has God answered your prayer? It is wrong for prayers to be left unanswered, because prayers are not just a speaking into the air. Prayers are meant to be answered. Unanswered prayers are vain prayers. Christians must learn to have answered prayers. Since you have believed in God, your prayers should be answered by God. Your prayers are useless if God does not answer them. You must pray until your prayers are answered. Prayer is not only for spiritual cultivation but even more for receiving answers from God.</p>
<p>Prayer is not that easy a lesson to learn. A person may be a Christian for thirty or even fifty years and yet not learn to pray well. On the one hand, prayer is not a simple thing. On the other hand, prayer is so easy that a person can pray as soon as he believes in the Lord. Prayer can be considered the most profound as well as the simplest subject. It is so profound that some still cannot pray well despite learning about it all their lives. Many children of God feel that they do not know how to pray even up to the time they die. However, prayer is so simple that the moment a person believes in the Lord, he can start praying and have his prayers answered. If you begin your Christian life in a good way, you will always receive answers to your prayers. If you do not have a good start, you may not have an answer to prayer for three or even five years. If you do not have a proper foundation, you will need much effort to correct it later. Therefore, once a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to receive answers from God for his prayers. We hope that every believer will pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CONDITIONS FOR PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED</h2>
<p>In the Bible we can see many conditions for having prayers answered, but only a few of them are basic. We believe that if we meet these few conditions, our prayers will be answered. These few conditions are equally applicable to those who have prayed for many years. These are very basic conditions, and we should pay attention to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Asking</h2>
<p>All prayers should be genuine petitions before God. After a brother was saved, he prayed every day. One day a sister asked him, &ldquo;Has God ever listened to your prayer?&rdquo; He was surprised. To him prayer was just prayer; why did anyone have to bother about whether or not they were answered? From that time on, whenever he prayed, he asked God to answer his prayer. He began to consider how many of his prayers were answered. He discovered that his prayers were quite vague and capricious. It did not matter whether God answered them, and it did not matter whether God ignored them. They were like prayers to God for the sun to rise the next day; the sun would rise whether or not he prayed. He had been a Christian for a year, yet none of his prayers were answered. All that time he had been just kneeling and muttering words. He could not pinpoint what he had asked for. This amounted to not having asked for anything at all.</p>
<p>The Lord says, &ldquo;Knock and it shall be opened to you&rdquo; (Matt. 7:7). If what you are knocking on is just the wall, the Lord will not open the wall to you. But if you indeed are knocking on the door, the Lord will surely open the door to you. If you ask to go in as well, the Lord will surely let you in. The Lord said, &ldquo;Seek and you shall find&rdquo; (v. 7). Suppose that there are many things here. Which one do you want? You must ask for at least one thing. You cannot say that anything will do. God wants to know what you specifically want and what you specifically are asking for. Only then can He give it to you. Hence, to ask means to demand something specific. We have to ask. This is what it means to seek and to knock. Suppose you want something from your father today. You have to ask for the specific thing you want. If you go to a pharmacy for medicine, you must say exactly what medicine you want. If you go to a market to purchase vegetables, you must say what vegetables you want. It is strange that people can come to the Lord without saying what they want. This is why the Lord says that we need to ask and ask specifically. The problem with us is that we do not ask. The hindrance is on our side. In our prayers we need to speak what we need and what we want. Do not pray an all-inclusive prayer in a frivolous way, caring little whether or not it is answered.</p>
<p>A new believer needs to learn to pray. He needs to pray with a specific goal in mind. &ldquo;You do not have because you do not ask&rdquo; (James 4:2). Many people go through the motion of prayer without asking for anything. It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything. You need to learn to ask for something; you need to knock, really knock hard, at a door. Once you clearly identify the entrance and seek to go in, knock hard at the door. When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing. Do not be like some brothers and sisters who stand up in the meeting to pray for twenty minutes or half an hour without knowing what they want. It is strange that many people have long prayers that do not ask for anything.</p>
<p>You must learn to be specific with your prayer. You should know when God has answered your prayers and when He has not answered your prayers. If it makes no difference to you whether or not God answers your prayers, it will be hard for you to effectively pray to Him if you come across a difficulty in the future. Empty prayers will not be effectual in times of need. If prayers are empty when needs are specific, one cannot expect any solution for the problem. Only specific prayers can deal with specific problems.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Asking Evilly</h2>
<p>We should ask, but there is a second condition to prayer; we should not ask evilly. &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly&rdquo; (James 4:3). We should ask God out of necessity. We should not ask mindlessly, unreasonably, or wildly. We should never ask carelessly or evilly for any unnecessary things according to our lust or our flesh. If we do, our prayers will be in vain. While God often gives us &ldquo;superabundantly above all that we ask or think&rdquo; (Eph. 3:20), asking evilly is a different matter.</p>
<p>Asking evilly means asking beyond one&rsquo;s capacity or real need. If you have a need, you can ask God. But you should only ask God to take care of your need. Asking beyond what you need is asking evilly. If you have a great need, it is not wrong to ask God to satisfy such a need. But if you do not have a great need, and you ask for it, you are asking evilly. You can only ask according to your capacity and need. You should never ask foolishly for this and that. Asking carelessly is to ask evilly, and such asking will not receive any answer from God. Asking evilly before God is like a four-year-old child asking his father for the moon in the sky. God is not pleased with evil asking. Every Christian should learn to confine his prayers within the proper scope. Do not open your mouth rashly and ask for more than you actually need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Dealing with Sins</h2>
<p>Some do not ask evilly, but God does not answer their prayers. This is because there is a basic barrier between them and God&mdash;sin. &ldquo;If I regard iniquity in my heart, / The Lord will not hear&rdquo; (Psa. 66:18). If a person has obvious and known sins in his heart, yet is unwilling to drop or part with them, the Lord will not answer his prayer. (Note the words <em>in my heart.</em>) The Lord cannot answer a person&rsquo;s prayer when there is such a great hindrance.</p>
<p>What does it mean to &ldquo;regard iniquity in my heart&rdquo;? It means to keep a sin in one&rsquo;s heart, being unwilling to part with it. Such a person knows something is a sin, yet he continues to cherish it. It is not only a weakness in conduct or appearance but also a craving in the heart. This is different from the person spoken of in Romans 7. Although the person in Romans 7 has failed, he hates what he is doing. The person here, however, regards iniquity in his heart. This means he keeps the iniquity to himself and is unwilling and reluctant to let go of it. The sin remains not only in his conduct but also in his heart. The Lord will not hear such a one when he prays. So long as there is one sin, it will hinder God from answering our prayer. We should not keep any favorite sin in our heart. We should acknowledge all sins as sins and should put them under the blood. The Lord can sympathize with our weakness, but the Lord will not allow us to regard iniquity in our hearts. Our prayers will not prevail if we have removed all the sins outwardly but still regard them in our heart and are unwilling and reluctant to part with them. The moment we begin our Christian life, we have to ask for the Lord&rsquo;s grace to keep us from falling and to sanctify us in our conduct. At the same time, we must thoroughly reject all sins in our heart. We should not retain or regard any sin in our heart. Our prayer will be useless if sin remains in our heart. The Lord will not listen to such a prayer.</p>
<p>Proverbs 28:13 says, &ldquo;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: / but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.&rdquo; You must confess your sins. You must tell the Lord, &ldquo;I have regarded a sin in my heart. I cannot give it up. I ask You to forgive me. I want to forsake this sin. Please deliver me from this sin. Do not let this sin remain in me. I do not want it. I want to reject it.&rdquo; If you confess to the Lord this way, the Lord will forgive; you will receive forgiveness. Then, your prayer will be heard. You must never be loose in this matter. You will not receive anything if you do not ask. You also will not receive anything if you ask evilly. Even if you do not ask evilly, the Lord will not answer your prayer as long as you keep back a favorite sin and regard it in your heart.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Believing</h2>
<p>A condition on the positive side for having prayer answered is faith. Faith is indispensable. Without faith, prayer is ineffectual. The story in Mark 11 speaks loudly of the need for faith in prayer. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them&rdquo; (v. 24). We must believe when we pray. If we believe that we have received what we are praying for, we will have them. We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is. The Lord said, &ldquo;Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; He did not say, &ldquo;Believe that you <em>will receive</em> them&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Believe that you <em>have received</em> them.&rdquo; We should believe that we have received what we asked for, and we will have them. The believing that the Lord speaks of here is followed by its predicate <em>you have received.</em> What is faith? Faith is believing that we have received what we have asked for.</p>
<p>Christians often make the mistake of separating <em>believe</em> from its predicate <em>you have received.</em> They place it before the expression <em>you will have them.</em> They pray to the Lord thinking that it is a matter of great faith to &ldquo;believe...and you will have them.&rdquo; They pray to the Lord that the mountain be taken up and cast into the sea, and they believe that it will be so. They think that this kind of faith is great faith. However, this is to move <em>believe</em> away from <em>you have received</em> and to place it before <em>you will have them.</em> The Bible says that we should believe that we have received, not that we will receive. The two are definitely not the same. Not only do new believers need to learn this, but even those who have been believers for many years need to learn this.</p>
<p>What is faith? Faith is the assurance that God <em>has</em> answered our prayer. It is not the conviction that God <em>will</em> answer our prayer. Faith is when we kneel down to pray and say in an instant, &ldquo;Thank God! He has answered my prayer. Thank God! This matter is settled.&rdquo; This is to believe that we have received. A person may kneel down and pray and may rise and say, &ldquo;I believe that God will definitely hear my prayer.&rdquo; The expression <em>will definitely hear</em> is wrong. No matter how hard he tries to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in this way, he will not see any result. Suppose you pray for a sick person and he says, &ldquo;Thank God! I am healed.&rdquo; His temperature may still be high; there may be no change in his symptoms at all. But his problem is over because he is clear within himself that he is healed. However, if he says, &ldquo;I believe the Lord will surely heal my sickness,&rdquo; he will probably need to try harder to &ldquo;believe.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; He did not say that you will receive if you believe that you <em>will</em> receive. If you turn this around, it does not work. Brothers and sisters, have you seen the key? Genuine faith lies in the phrase <em>It is finished.</em> Genuine faith is thanking God for having already answered your prayers.</p>
<p>We need to say a few words more about faith. Consider the matter of healing. We can find some solid examples of faith in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. There are three sentences in the Gospel of Mark which bear special significance to prayer. The first relates to the Lord&rsquo;s power, the second to the Lord&rsquo;s will, and the third to the Lord&rsquo;s act.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord&rsquo;s Power&mdash;God Can</h2>
<p>Let us look at Mark 9:21-23, which says, &ldquo;And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood. And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us. And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; The father said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;If You can do anything...help us.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus repeated his word and said, &ldquo;If You can.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;if You can&rdquo; is a quotation of the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;if You can.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was repeating what the father said. The father said, &ldquo;If You can do anything...help us.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; It was not a question of &ldquo;if You can,&rdquo; but a question of whether or not he could believe.</p>
<p>When man finds himself in difficulty, he is usually full of doubt; he cannot believe in the power of God. This is the first thing we need to deal with. It may seem at times that the power of the obstacle is greater than the power of God. The Lord Jesus rebuked the father for doubting the power of God. In the Bible we seldom find the Lord interrupting a person as He did in this case. It seems that the Lord was angry when He said, &ldquo;If You can.&rdquo; The Lord rebuked the father when the father said, &ldquo;If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&rdquo; What the Lord meant was, &ldquo;How can you say, &lsquo;If You can&rsquo;? What is this? All things are possible to him who believes. This is not a matter of &lsquo;if I can,&rsquo; but a matter of whether or not you believe. How dare you ask if I can!&rdquo; When God&rsquo;s children pray, they should learn to lift up their eyes and say, &ldquo;Lord! You can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark 2 records the incident of the Lord healing a paralytic. The Lord said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Child, your sins are forgiven&rdquo; (v. 5). Some scribes reasoned in their hearts, saying, &ldquo;Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God?&rdquo; (v. 7). In their hearts they thought that only God could forgive sins and that Jesus could not. They regarded forgiveness of sins as a great thing. But the Lord said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). The Lord was showing them that to man it was a question of whether or not one could do it, but to God it was a question of which was easier. For man, it is impossible for anyone to forgive sins or to ask the paralytic to stand up and walk. However, the Lord showed them that He could forgive sins as well as make the paralytic rise up and walk. Both forgiving and making the paralytic rise up and walk were easy for the Lord. The Lord was showing them that &ldquo;God can.&rdquo; In our prayer we need to know that &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and that nothing is too difficult for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Lord&rsquo;s Will&mdash;God is Willing</h2>
<p>It is true that God can do everything, but how do I know that He is willing to heal me? I do not know His will. Perhaps the Lord is not willing to heal me. What should I do? Let us look at another story. Mark 1:41 says, &ldquo;And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing. No matter how great His power is, what does it matter if He is unwilling to heal? If God does not want to heal us, the greatness of His power will be of no consequence to us. The first question that has to be settled is whether or not God <em>can,</em> but the second question that also has to be settled is whether or not God <em>will.</em> The Lord said to the leper, &ldquo;I am willing.&rdquo; The Old Testament tells us that leprosy is a very filthy disease (Lev. 13&mdash;14). Whoever contacted a leper was defiled. However, the Lord&rsquo;s love was so great that He said, &ldquo;I am willing.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus stretched out His hand and touched and cleansed the leper! The leper entreated the Lord, and the Lord was willing to cleanse him. Can it be that the Lord will not heal our illness? Can it be that the Lord will not answer our prayers? We can all say, &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and &ldquo;God is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lord&rsquo;s Act&mdash;God Has Done</h2>
<p>It is not enough for us to know that God can and God will. We need to know one more thing&mdash;God has done. We need to go back to Mark 11:24, which we quoted earlier: &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; This tells us that God has done something already.</p>
<p>What is faith? Faith is not just believing that God can and will do something but also believing that God has done something already. God has accomplished it. If you believe that you have received it, you will have it. If you believe and are confident that God can and will do a certain thing because He has given you a word concerning it, you should thank Him, saying, &ldquo;God has done it!&rdquo; Many people&rsquo;s prayers are not answered because they are not clear about this point; they still hope that they <em>will</em> receive something. However, to hope means to expect something in the future, whereas to believe means to consider something as being done. Genuine faith says, &ldquo;Thank God, He has healed me! Thank God, I have received it! Thank God, I am cleansed! Thank God, I have recovered!&rdquo; When faith is perfect, it will not only say &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and &ldquo;God wills,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;God has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God has listened to our prayers! God has accomplished everything! If we believe that we have received it, we will receive it. Very often, our faith is a faith that believes in what we will receive. As a result, we never receive anything. We should have the faith that we have already received. Faith is always a matter of &ldquo;having been done&rdquo; rather than of &ldquo;will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider a simple illustration. A person has just heard the gospel. If you ask him, &ldquo;Have you believed in the Lord Jesus?&rdquo;, he may answer, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo; You may then ask, &ldquo;Are you saved?&rdquo; If he says, &ldquo;I will be saved,&rdquo; you know that he is not saved. Suppose you ask him again, &ldquo;Do you really believe that you <em>are</em> saved?&rdquo; If he says, &ldquo;I will surely be saved,&rdquo; you know that he is still not saved. You may want to ask him again, &ldquo;Are you really sure that you <em>will be</em> saved?&rdquo; If he answers, &ldquo;I <em>think</em> I will,&rdquo; his words do not sound like someone who is saved. If one says, &ldquo;I will be saved,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will surely be saved,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think I will surely be saved,&rdquo; there is no guarantee that he is saved. If the person says, &ldquo;I am saved,&rdquo; he has the right tone. Once a man believes, he is saved. Any faith, if it is faith at all, believes in what has been accomplished. For example, once a person possesses faith at the time of his salvation, he immediately says, &ldquo;Thank God, I have received.&rdquo; Let us lay hold of these three things&mdash;God can, God wills, and God has done.</p>
<p>Faith is not a psychological exercise. <em>Faith is receiving God&rsquo;s word</em> and believing with much assurance that God can, God wills, and God has done. If you have not received His word, <em>do not take the spiritual risk of trying to tempt God.</em> The exercise of psychology is not faith. Take illness as an example: All who are healed through genuine faith are not afraid of a medical checkup (Mark 1:44). The result of a medical checkup for those who have experienced a genuine divine healing will prove that it was a genuine healing rather than something psychological.</p>
<p>When new believers learn to pray, they should pray in two stages. In the first stage they should pray until they receive a promise. They should pray until they receive God&rsquo;s word. All prayers begin by asking God for something. Such prayers can continue for a period of time, sometimes lasting for three to five years. One needs to keep asking. Some prayers are answered quickly, while other prayers continue to go unanswered for years. This is the period of time when one needs to continue to ask. The second stage begins from the time one receives a promise and extends to the time the promise is realized. It begins from the time one receives God&rsquo;s word and extends to the time His word is fulfilled. This stage is not for praying, but for praising. In the first stage one prays, but in the second stage one praises. In the first stage he prays until he receives a word. In the second stage he praises the Lord continuously until the word is fulfilled. This is the secret to prayer.</p>
<p>Some people only know two points about prayer: First, they pray on their knees for what they do not have, and second, they have it; God has given it to them. Suppose I ask for a watch from the Lord, and after a few days the Lord gives me a watch. There are only two events: being without something and having something. Some do not realize that there is another event in between these two&mdash;the event of faith. Suppose I pray for a watch and one day say, &ldquo;Thank God, He has already heard my prayer.&rdquo; Although my hands are still empty, I am clear within that I already have the watch. Indeed, after a few days the watch arrives. We cannot be concerned with just two events: not having and then having. We must be concerned with a third event&mdash;an additional event between not having and having, in which God gives us a promise, and then we believe and rejoice over it. Perhaps we have to wait three days before we actually receive the watch. But in our spirit, we received it three days ago already. A Christian should experience this kind of <em>receiving in the spirit.</em> If a person never experiences this kind of receiving in the spirit, he does not have faith.</p>
<p>We hope that new believers will know what faith is, and we hope that they will learn to pray. Perhaps, you have prayed continually for three or five days, a month, or even a year, and still your hands are empty. But deep in your heart, you have a little assurance that the matter will eventually be accomplished. At that time you should begin to praise God. You should continue praising Him until you have received the thing in your hand. Simply put, the first stage is to pray from nothing to having faith, and the second stage is to praise from having faith to actually receiving.</p>
<p>Why should we divide our prayers into these two stages? Suppose a person prays from having nothing to having faith. If he continues to pray, he may lose his faith. Once a person has acquired faith, he should begin praising. If he continues to pray, he may pray away his faith and not receive anything in the end. &ldquo;You will have it&rdquo; is an actual having in the hands, while &ldquo;you have received it&rdquo; is a having in the spirit. If the faith is already there, but the things have not materialized, one has to remind God with praise; he should not try to remind Him with prayer. If God has said that He will give us something, what else do we need to say? If we have the inward assurance that &ldquo;we have received it,&rdquo; what more do we need to pray for? Many Christians have the experience that as soon as their prayer strikes faith, they can no longer continue to pray. They can only say, &ldquo;Lord! I praise You.&rdquo; They have to keep their faith and praise, &ldquo;Lord! I praise You. You have heard my prayer. I praise You because You answered my prayer a month ago.&rdquo; If you do this, you will receive. Unfortunately, some people do not have the knowledge. God has already promised them something, yet they still pray. In the end their prayer drives away their faith. This is a great loss.</p>
<p>The word in Mark 11:24 is too precious. In the whole New Testament, we cannot find another passage that explains faith as clearly as this one. &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; If a person sees this, he will know what prayer really is, and prayer will be a powerful tool in his hands.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Persevering in Asking</h2>
<p>Another point about prayer which requires attention is that we must persevere in prayer and never stop praying. Luke 18:1 says, &ldquo;They ought always to pray and not lose heart.&rdquo; Some prayers require perseverance. One has to pray to such an extent that the prayer seems to wear out the Lord and force Him to answer. This is another kind of faith. The Lord said, &ldquo;Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo; (v. 8). This faith is different from the faith spoken of earlier, but they are not contradictory. Mark 11 says that we must pray until we have faith. Luke 18 says that we must ask again and again. We must have the faith to pray to the Lord persistently until one day He is compelled to answer our prayer. We should not care whether or not there is a promise. We should just pray until God is compelled to answer.</p>
<p>Many prayers are inconsistent prayers. A person can pray for one or two days. But after three months, he completely forgets it. Some people can pray about something only once. They cannot even pray a second time for it. Such ones care little whether they receive what they ask for. Please count how many of your prayers have been offered for the second time, the third time, the fifth time, or the tenth time. If you have forgotten your prayers, how can you expect God to remember them? If you do not have a heart to pray, how can you expect God to have a heart to listen? If you have forgotten your prayer, how can you expect God to remember it? Actually, you have never wanted what you asked for. A person will pray persistently only if he has a real need. One prays persistently only when he is pressed in the environment and driven by needs. In such cases he may persist for decades and still not give up praying, &ldquo;Lord! If You do not answer me, I will not stop asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you want to ask for something, you should trouble God about it. If you really want it, you must ask persistently until God hears you. You have to ask in such a way that God cannot do anything except answer your prayer. You have to ask until God is forced to answer you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PRACTICE OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Every Christian should have a prayer-book, one a year. He should record his prayers as one keeps books in accounting. Each page should be divided into four columns. The first column should record the date he begins to pray for something. The second column should record the prayer item. The third column should record the date the prayer is answered, and the fourth column should record how God answers the prayer. In this way, one will find out how many things he asks God for in a year, how many prayers God answers, and what prayers are still unanswered. New believers should definitely keep such a book. But it is good for those who have been believers for many years to keep a prayer-book also.</p>
<p>The advantage of writing things down in a prayer-book is that it shows us whether or not God is answering our prayers. Once God&rsquo;s answers stop, something must be wrong. It is good for Christians to be zealous in serving the Lord, but such service is useless if their prayers are not answered. If a man&rsquo;s way to God is blocked, his way to men is also blocked. If a man has no power before God, he will have no power before men. We must first seek to be a man of power before God before we can be useful before men.</p>
<p>A brother once wrote down the names of one hundred forty persons and prayed for their salvation. Some names were recorded in the morning and the persons were saved in the afternoon. After eighteen months, only two on the list remained unsaved. This is a very good pattern for us. May God gain more Christians who will keep a record of their prayers. I hope you will put this into practice. Write down the items you are praying for one by one and the items that God has answered. Any item that has been recorded in the book, but has not received an answer, should be followed up by persistent prayer. You should only stop if God shows you that a certain prayer is not according to His will. If He has not shown you this, pray persistently until you receive an answer. You should not be careless in any way. You should be strictly trained in this matter from the beginning. You should be this serious before God. Once you pray, do not stop until you receive an answer.</p>
<p>In using the prayer-book, note that some items require daily prayer while others require prayer only once a week. The schedule depends on the number of prayer items you have in your prayer book. If you have little to ask, you can pray daily over every item in the book. If there are many items, you can arrange for certain items to be prayed over on Mondays and others to be prayed over on Tuesdays. Just as men schedule their time to do other things, we should set aside a specific time every day for prayer. If our prayers are not specific, we will not need a prayer-book. If our prayers are specific, we will need a prayer-book. We can place this book in the same place we put our Bible and hymn book. They are to be used daily. After a period of time, count how many prayers have been answered and how many prayers have gone unanswered. It is a blessing to pray in a specific way according to a prayer-book.</p>
<p>As for the prayer that the Lord teaches us in Matthew 6, the prayer of 1 Timothy 2, and prayers for light, life, grace, and gifts for the church, these are general subjects for prayer. They should not be classified under ordinary items for prayer. We should pray for these great things every day.</p>
<p>Prayer has two ends&mdash;the person who is praying and the one who is being prayed for. Many times, the one being prayed for will not change unless the praying one is first changed. If the situation on their side remains unchanged, we need to seek after God concerning our side. We should say, &ldquo;O Lord! What changes do I have to make? What sins have I not dealt with yet? What loves should I forsake? Am I really learning the lesson of faith? Is there anything else I should learn?&rdquo; If there is a need for change on our side, we must change first. We cannot expect those who are being prayed for to change while there is no change at all on our side.</p>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to pray earnestly. He must learn the lesson of prayer well before he can have a deeper knowledge of God and a fruitful future for himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 7:12; Psa. 57:8-9; 63:1; 78:34; 90:14; 108:2-3; Exo. 16:21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. EARLY MORNING BEING THE BEST TIME OF THE DAY</h2>
<p>What time should believers rise up every day?</p>
<p>A sister once put it well when she said, &ldquo;How much a person loves the Lord can be judged primarily by the way he chooses between his bed and the Lord. Do you love your bed or the Lord more? If you love your bed more, you sleep a little longer. If you love the Lord more, you rise up a little earlier.&rdquo; She spoke these words more than thirty years ago. Yet they are still fresh to us today. A man must choose between his love for his bed and his love for the Lord. The more he loves the Lord, the more he will rise up early.</p>
<p>A Christian should rise up early because the early morning is the best time to meet the Lord. Except for those who are sick, all the brothers and sisters should rise up early. Actually, many sicknesses are not sicknesses at all. They become sicknesses because men love themselves too much. Other than those who are advised to rest by doctors, everyone should rise early. We do not want to go to extremes; we advise sick brothers and sisters to sleep more. However, the healthy ones should get up as early as possible. The best time to meet the Lord, to contact Him, and to fellowship with Him is early in the morning. Manna is gathered before the sun rises (Exo. 16:14-21). Anyone who wants to eat God&rsquo;s food should rise up early. When the sun waxes hot, manna melts and is gone. If we want to receive spiritual nourishment and spiritual edification, and if we want to have spiritual fellowship and spiritual supply, we need to rise up early. If we rise up late, the manna will be gone. The early morning is the very time when God dispenses His spiritual food and holy fellowship to His children. Whoever is late will not gather anything. Many children of God lead a sick life, not because they have spiritual problems, but because they rise up too late. Many children of God have no lack in consecration, zeal, or love, but they cannot live a normal Christian life because they rise up too late. Do not think that this is a small matter. Do not think that this has nothing to do with spirituality; it has much to do with spirituality. Many people are not spiritual because they rise up too late. Many people have been Christians for years, yet they fail to live a proper Christian life because they rise up too late. We do not know of anyone who knows how to pray, yet rises up late. Nor do we know of anyone who has intimate fellowship with God, yet rises up late. All those who know God rise up early. They rise up early as a rule to fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Proverbs 26:14 says, &ldquo;As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.&rdquo; Here it says that a slothful person in bed is like a door that turns upon its hinges. The slothful keeps turning upon his bed; he cannot leave it. He turns to one side on his bed. Then he turns to the other side on his bed. Whichever way he turns, he is still on the bed. Many people cannot part with their bed. They love their bed as they turn from one side to the other. When they turn left, they are on their bed. When they turn right, they are still on their bed. They love to sleep and cannot part with their bed. Many people just want to sleep a little longer; they cannot get out of their bed. If one wants to learn to serve God and be a good Christian, he has to rise up early in the morning every day.</p>
<p>Those who rise up early in the morning reap much spiritual benefit. Their prayers at other times of the day cannot be compared with their prayers in the early morning. Their Bible reading at other times of the day cannot be compared with their reading in the early morning. Their fellowship with the Lord at other times cannot be compared with their fellowship in the early morning. The early morning is the best time of the day. We should spend the best time of the day&mdash;the early morning&mdash;before the Lord, rather than in other things. Some Christians spend the whole day on other matters and kneel down to read the Bible and pray only at night when they are about to go to sleep. No wonder they are ineffective in their Bible reading, their prayer, and their fellowship with the Lord. They wake up too late in the morning. The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him.</p><h2 class="head1">II. EXAMPLES OF EARLY RISING</h2>
<p>In the Bible we find God&rsquo;s servants rising up early in the morning. Let us consider their examples:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Abraham&mdash;Gen. 19:27; 21:14; 22:3</li>
<li>Jacob&mdash;Gen. 28:18</li>
<li>Moses&mdash;Exo. 8:20; 9:13; 24:4; 34:4</li>
<li>Joshua&mdash;Josh. 3:1; 6:12; 7:16; 8:10</li>
<li>Gideon&mdash;Judg. 6:38</li>
<li>Hannah&mdash;1 Sam. 1:19</li>
<li>Samuel&mdash;1 Sam. 15:12</li>
<li>David&mdash;1 Sam. 17:20</li>
<li>Job&mdash;Job 1:5</li>
<li>Mary&mdash;Luke 24:22; Mark 16:9; John 20:1</li>
<li>The apostles&mdash;Acts 5:21</li>
</ol>
<p>These many verses tell us that God&rsquo;s servants had the habit of dealing with God early in the morning. Every one of them had the habit of waking early in the morning and fellowshipping with God early in the morning. They rose up early in the morning to do many things related to God&rsquo;s business. They also rose up early in the morning to consecrate themselves. Although there is no commandment in the Bible that tells us to get up early, there are sufficient examples in the Bible to show us that all faithful servants of God rise up early. Even the Lord Jesus Himself rose up early. He rose up very early in the morning, while it was still night, and went away to a deserted place to pray (Mark 1:35). When He wanted to appoint the twelve apostles, He called them to Himself early in the morning (Luke 6:13). If the Lord had to rise up early to do these things, how much more do we need to rise up early?</p>
<p>Any brother or sister who wants to follow the Lord must never think that there is little difference in rising up an hour early. You must realize that your Bible reading becomes ineffective if you rise up an hour late. Likewise, your prayer becomes ineffective if you rise up an hour late. Although one may spend the same amount of time in reading the Bible, an hour&rsquo;s difference will produce very different results. Early rising brings in great blessing. We hope that you will not miss the blessing of early rising at the start of your Christian life. One brother was asked at least fifty times during his first three years as a Christian, &ldquo;What time did you get up this morning?&rdquo; Early rising is a great blessing. Those who have learned to rise up early know the significance of it. If you do not rise up early in the morning, you will live in spiritual poverty. Late rising brings in much loss. Many spiritual things are lost through late rising.</p>
<p>We have seen many examples from the Bible. How about the servants of God who are not mentioned in the Bible, like George M&#252;ller, John Wesley, and many other famous servants of God? They also rose up early in the morning. We can say that almost all the ones we know of or have read about from books, who are of any use in God&rsquo;s hands, pay attention to the matter of rising early. They call this early rising &ldquo;morning watch.&rdquo; All servants of God emphasize morning watch. The term <em>morning watch</em> itself tells us that it is done early in the morning. Have you heard of anyone who keeps watch when the sun is already up? Never! One keeps morning watch early in the morning. This is a good habit, and we Christians should cultivate this habit. God&rsquo;s children should not be sloppy people. The church has been practicing this for years. We should maintain this good habit of meeting God early in the morning. The term <em>morning watch</em> is not found in the Bible. We can give it another name, but no matter what name we give to it, meeting God early in the morning is a very crucial matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. WHAT TO DO IN THE EARLY MORNING</h2>
<p>We do not merely rise up early. There must be spiritual exercise and spiritual content to what we do. Here are a few things to do early in the morning:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:12 shows us that the early morning is the best time to fellowship with the Lord. To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us (Psa. 119:105, 147). During this time our hearts are drawn near to God, and we allow God to draw near to our hearts. We should rise up early in the morning to tarry before the Lord, to meditate, to receive leading and impressions from God, to learn to touch Him, and to give Him an opportunity to speak to us.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Praise and Sing</h2>
<p>There must be the sound of praise and singing in the early morning. The early morning is the best time to sing praises to God. When we offer our highest praise to God, our spirit rises to the highest peak.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Read the Bible</h2>
<p>The early morning is the time for us to gather the manna (which is Christ). What does it mean to eat the manna? It means to enjoy Christ, to enjoy God&rsquo;s Word, and to enjoy His truth early in the morning every day. After we eat the manna, we have the strength to journey in the wilderness. The early morning is the time to gather the manna. One will not be fed spiritually or be satisfied if he spends his early morning on other things.</p>
<p>We have mentioned already that we should have two Bibles, one with marks and notes in it to use in the afternoon and the other with nothing in it for &ldquo;eating manna&rdquo; early in the morning. In the early morning, do not read too much and do not take many portions of the Word. Instead, read a single portion of the Bible carefully, always mingling your reading with unceasing communion with God and singing. This does not mean that you should fellowship with God first, praise second, and then read the Bible last. You have to blend all these things together. At the same time you should also pray. Come to God&rsquo;s presence and open His Word. As you read, you may be convicted to confess your sins. As you read certain portions, you may be touched by His grace to offer up thanksgiving. You can also pray to God concerning what you have read in the Word. You can say, &ldquo;Lord, this is truly what I need. This portion, this verse, this word, truly exposes my lack. Lord, fill up this lack of mine.&rdquo; When you find a promise, you can say, &ldquo;Lord, I believe in this promise.&rdquo; When you find grace, you can say, &ldquo;Lord, I take this grace.&rdquo; You can also intercede. While you are reading, you may remember the condition of those who fall short of what this portion says. You should not accuse or criticize them. Instead, you should pray, &ldquo;God, fulfill this word in me. Fulfill this word also in my brother and sister.&rdquo; You can confess your sins and the sins of others. You can pray for yourself and for others. You can believe for yourself and for others. You can give thanks for yourself and for others. Your Bible reading in the morning should not be too long; it should not cover too much. Two, three, four, or five verses are sufficient. You can dwell on them for an hour. As you read these verses word by word, pray over them, and commune with God through them, you will be filled.</p>
<p>Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, there were people who fellowshipped with God this way. They knew God and communed with God. Their fellowship with God became part of their lives.</p>
<p>In Psalms David interchanged the pronouns <em>you</em> and <em>He</em> freely. At one moment he would be speaking to man, and at the next moment he would be praying to God. In the same psalm, he would say a few sentences to man and then say something to God. On the one hand, David spoke to man. On the other hand, he spoke to God. The Psalms show us that David was a person who was in constant fellowship with God.</p>
<p>While Nehemiah was working, he would speak a few words and then offer a short prayer. When the king asked him something, he would speak to the king first and then to the Lord. He mingled his work and prayer together. He did not separate his work from his prayer.</p>
<p>Paul wrote the book of Romans to those in Rome. However, more than once he turned his speaking to the Lord. A few times he seemed to have forgotten the fact that he was writing to the Romans. It seemed as if he were talking to God. We can find frequent examples like this in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. In an instant he could turn around and speak to God.</p>
<p>Those who have read the autobiography of Madame Guyon will notice one characteristic of hers. Most autobiographies are written for man. But in Madame Guyon&rsquo;s autobiography, she spoke to man in one instant and to God in the next instant. In one moment she would be speaking to LaCombe (who asked her to write her autobiography), and at the next moment she would be speaking to God. This is fellowship. One does not know where fellowship with God begins and where it ends. Fellowship does not mean to set aside other affairs to pray. Nor does it mean to pray first and then deal with the affairs. It is to do both simultaneously.</p>
<p>Hence, during this early morning hour of gathering manna, you should learn to mingle prayer with God&rsquo;s Word. You should learn to mingle praise and fellowship with God&rsquo;s Word. One moment you may be on earth, but the next moment you are in the heavens. One moment you may be in yourself, but the next moment you are in God. If you maintain this practice before God every morning, you will be filled after some time, and God&rsquo;s word will dwell in you richly. Such reading of God&rsquo;s Word, such gathering of manna, is indispensable to us. Many brothers and sisters are weak and unable to take the wilderness journey. We need to ask them, &ldquo;Have you eaten anything?&rdquo; They cannot walk because they have not eaten enough. Manna is gathered in the early morning. This is why we need to rise up a little earlier. We will not have any manna if we are late. We have to rise up early in the morning to labor in God&rsquo;s Word.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Pray</h2>
<p>In the early morning we should fellowship, praise, and gather the manna. We must also pray to the Lord. Psalms 63:1 [KJV] and 78:34 [KJV] both say that we should seek the Lord early. The prayer spoken of in the previous paragraph is a kind of blending prayer. But the prayer we are talking about here is more specific. After one fellowships, praises, and eats manna, he has strength and can present everything in prayer before God. Prayer surely requires much strength. One must first draw near to God early in the morning and be fed. Then he can set aside about half an hour or a quarter of an hour to pray for a few urgent things. He can pray for himself, for the church, or for the world. Of course, he can pray also in the afternoon or at night. But if he takes advantage of the fresh power he has gained, the power acquired in the early morning through fellowshipping with God and eating manna, he will receive greater support.</p>
<p>Every believer should do these four things conscientiously before the Lord early in the morning: fellowship with Him, praise Him, read the Bible, and pray to Him. Whether or not a person has done these four things in the morning is manifested in his walk during the day. George M&#252;ller confessed that the degree to which he was fed by the Lord in the morning determined his spiritual condition throughout the whole day. His spiritual condition for the day depended on his feeding before the Lord in the morning. Many Christians find themselves weak during the day because their mornings are ill spent. Of course, there are those who are so far ahead in their spiritual journey that they can experience the total separation of the spirit from the soul. Their outward man is broken, and they are not that easily shaken by anything. However, this is another matter altogether. New believers should learn to rise up early. Once they become loose in this, they become loose in everything, and everything will go wrong. There is a great difference between being nourished and not being nourished in the morning.</p>
<p>A very famous musician once said, &ldquo;If I skip practicing for one day, I will notice it. If I skip practicing for two days, my friends will notice it. If I skip practicing for three days, my audience will notice it.&rdquo; If this is true for practicing music, it is even more true for the spiritual lesson of rising up early. If we fail to have a good morning watch before God, we will know it. Those who are experienced in the Lord also will know it when they come into contact with us. They will know that we have not touched the spiritual source. From the very first day, new believers should strictly discipline themselves. Every morning they should rise up early to exercise this way before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRACTICE OF EARLY RISING</h2>
<p>Finally, we should speak a little about actual ways to implement this practice. How can we rise up early? We need to pay attention to a few things.</p>
<p>All early risers must have the habit of going to bed early. No one can stay up late and rise up early. This is like burning a candle at both ends.</p>
<p>Do not set too high a standard for rising. Some people want to rise up at three or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. When they find out that they cannot make it, they quit after a few days. It is better to take a moderate course. Five or six o&rsquo;clock is a suitable time to get up. Get up when the sun is about to rise or has just risen. Always get up around sunrise. If one tries to get up too early, his practice may not last long. An unreasonably high standard will only result in a condemned conscience. Some people have set too high a standard for themselves. They get into problems with their family or their work. When they take hospitality at the homes of others, they get into problems with their hosts. This is not a profitable thing to do. Our standard should be reasonable. We do not advocate extremes. Do not set too high a standard for yourself. Before the Lord you should consider carefully the proper time for you to rise up. You should take into consideration your physical limitations as well as the environment. Set your standard accordingly and keep it.</p>
<p>You may face a little difficulty at the beginning. It is always easy the first and second day. But the third day is difficult. You will find it easy for the first few days. But after a few days, you will love the bed so much that you will not want to get up at all. This is especially true in winter. It takes a long time for us to build up a new habit. Perhaps you are used to getting up late, and your mind has been used to getting up late. But if you rise up early a few times, your mind will gradually adjust to getting up early. After you do this for a few days, you will not want to go back to sleep even if your mind is telling you to do so. In the beginning you will need to force yourself a little in order to rise up early. Before a habit is built up, you need to ask God for grace. Continue to ask until this habit is built up. Try to do this again and again. Give up your bed daily to rise up early. In the end you will rise up early spontaneously. You must build up this habit before God. You must not miss the grace of fellowship early in the morning.</p>
<p>A healthy person does not need more than eight hours of sleep. Do not think that you are an exception. Do not worry that early rising will affect your health. It may be your anxiety which is affecting your health. Many people love themselves too much and worry themselves to sickness. You may need ten or twelve hours of sleep if the doctor says that you are ill. But six to eight hours of sleep are sufficient for a normal person. However, do not go to the extreme. Maintain at least six to eight hours of sleep. We do not expect those who are sick to rise up early. If you are sick, it is all right for you to lie on your bed in the morning and read your Bible there. However, those who are not advised by doctors to stay in bed and who are not really sick should rise up early in the morning.</p>
<p>We hope those who are mature and weighty in the Lord will uphold this practice. The church should push the sluggard ones to go forward. They should be shaken up a little. We should usher the new believers into this great blessing. You should take every chance to ask the new ones, &ldquo;What time do you get up every day?&rdquo; After a few days, you have to ask them again, &ldquo;What time did you get up this morning?&rdquo; This kind of reminding should go on for at least a year into a person&rsquo;s initial Christian life. After a year, you may still need to ask, &ldquo;Brother, what time do you rise up now?&rdquo; Ask the new believers whenever you see them. You need to go to them and render them some help in this matter. However, if we have not learned the lesson well before the Lord, it will be hard for us to do this to others. This is why we must first learn this lesson well ourselves.</p>
<p>Early rising should be a believer&rsquo;s first habit among all habits. Giving thanks before meals is a habit. Meeting together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day is also a habit. Rising up early is even more an essential habit. A new believer needs to build up this habit. It is unfortunate that some have been Christians for years and yet have never enjoyed the blessing of early rising. They have never enjoyed the grace of early rising. If we want to experience this grace, we have to learn this lesson well. If more brothers and sisters will come together to learn this lesson, and if everyone will rise up early in the morning, the church will grow. When one brother receives more light, the whole church will receive more shining. When everyone receives a little more light each day, the church as a whole will become richer. The church is poor today because too few people are receiving their supply from the Head. If everyone receives something from the Head, however little it may seem to be, the culmination of all the little portions will make the whole very rich.</p>
<p>We do not wish to see only a minority of people working in the church. We hope to see all the members rising up before the Lord. We hope to see the whole church rising up to receive God&rsquo;s riches and grace. What one member receives from the Head becomes the profit of the whole Body. If every brother and sister takes this way, there will be many containers before God, and we will be richer and richer as the days go by. We hope that you will not consider early rising as a small matter. If we all learn to rise up early, and if we all maintain this habit, we will have a bright spiritual future ahead of us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:25; Matt. 18:20; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor. 14:23, 26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. CORPORATE GRACE BEING FOUND IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together&rdquo; (Heb. 10:25). Why should we not abandon the assembling together? Because God dispenses His grace to us through the assembling together. God&rsquo;s grace to man can be divided into two categories&mdash;personal and corporate. God gives us not only personal grace but also corporate grace. This corporate grace can be found only in the assembling together or the meetings.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of the subject of prayer. One can learn to pray by himself at home; there is no doubt that God listens to such prayers. God listens to individual prayers. However, there is another kind of prayer. In order for this other kind of prayer to be answered, it must be prayed in the meetings, in the principle of two or three asking together in the Lord&rsquo;s name. If a person tries to do this alone, he will not get any answer. Many great matters must be prayed over in the meetings before God will answer. They must be brought to the prayer meeting before we see them come to pass. God&rsquo;s corporate grace comes to man only through the meetings. You may think that it is sufficient for a man to pray alone and that he can seek God&rsquo;s mercy by himself. But the experience of many people tells us that individual prayers alone will not work. It seems that unless two or three people pray, or all the brothers and sisters come together to pray, God will not answer. Therefore, we have two kinds of answers to prayers: One is answer to individual prayers, and the other is answer to assembly prayers. If we do not meet with others, some prayers will not be answered.</p>
<p>We have also spoken of reading the Bible. Of course, God will give us individual grace when we read the Bible. However, some portions of the Word cannot be opened up by one person alone. God gives light when we meet, when we assemble ourselves together. In such a meeting, some brothers may be led to open up a particular portion of the Word. There may not be any speaking concerning that particular portion of the Word, yet the fact that everyone is assembled together gives God the opportunity to shed His light. Many brothers and sisters can testify that they understand more of God&rsquo;s Word in the meeting than when they study it individually. Many times in the meeting, God opens up one portion of the Word through another portion of the Word. As one person speaks on one passage, light shines on another passage. In this way more light is unveiled, and we receive grace in a corporate way.</p>
<p>If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace. God will only give us corporate grace in the meeting. If we do not meet with others, we will not receive this grace. This is why the Bible charges us not to abandon our assembling together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH AND THE MEETING</h2>
<p>One outstanding characteristic of the church is that it meets. A Christian can never substitute meetings with &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; pursuits. God has a category of grace reserved for the meetings only. If we do not meet with others, that portion of corporate grace will not be available to us.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God commanded the Israelites to meet. In many places in the Bible they are called <em>the congregation</em>. That they were called a congregation meant they had to meet together. When we come to the New Testament, the revelation is even clearer. We have the clear commandment not to abandon &ldquo;our own assembling together.&rdquo; God is not that interested in individuals being &ldquo;self-taught.&rdquo; We must assemble ourselves together before we can receive His corporate grace. No forsaker of meetings will keep His grace. It is a foolish thing to abandon assembling together. A man must meet; he must come together with other children of God before he can receive the corporate grace.</p>
<p>The Bible gives explicit commandments as well as clear examples of people meeting together. When the Lord was on the earth, He often met with His disciples. He met with them on the mountain (Matt. 5:1), in the wilderness (Mark 6:32-34), at home (2:1-2), and at the seaside (4:1). On the last evening before His crucifixion, He borrowed a large upper room and met with the disciples (14:15-17). After His resurrection, He appeared in the midst of their gathering (John 20:19, 26; Acts 1:4). Before the day of Pentecost, the disciples gathered together in one accord to pray (v. 14). When the day of Pentecost came, they were also gathered together (2:1). After that they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. Shortly thereafter, they were persecuted and went back to their own places. Yet they still met together (4:23-31). After Peter was released, he went to the house where the disciples were gathered together (12:12). First Corinthians 14 tells us clearly that the whole church gathered together (v. 23). It was <em>the whole church</em> that gathered together. No one who is part of the church can be exempt from meeting together with the church.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the word <em>church</em>? The word <em>church</em> is <em>ekklesia</em> in Greek. <em>Ek</em> means &ldquo;to come out,&rdquo; while <em>klesia</em> means &ldquo;to congregate or to gather.&rdquo; Thus, <em>ekklesia</em> means the gathering of those who have been called out. God is not only after some called out ones; He wants the called out ones to gather together. If all the called out ones are separated from one another, we will not have the church; the church will not be produced.</p>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God. We should never have the strange thought that we can be &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; Christians. We must eliminate such a thought from our mind. Christianity does not have &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; Christians; it only has the gathering of the whole church. Do not think that we can be Christians who just shut ourselves up to pray and to read the Bible alone at home. Christianity is not built on just individuals but also on the assembling together.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BODY<br />
MANIFESTED THROUGH THE MEETING</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body, and chapter fourteen speaks of the meeting. Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and chapter fourteen also speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts in the Body, whereas chapter fourteen speaks of the gifts in the church. According to these two chapters, it seems that the mutual functioning of the members of the Body is expressed in the meeting. When we put chapters twelve and fourteen together, we see clearly that chapter twelve shows us the Body while chapter fourteen shows us the Body in function. One chapter speaks of the Body, while the other speaks of the meeting. One speaks of the gifts in the Body, while the other speaks of the gifts in the meeting. The functioning of the Body is realized specifically through the meeting. The mutual help, mutual influence, and mutual care of the members (e.g., the eyes helping the legs, the ears helping the hands, the hands helping the mouth) are more clearly manifested in the meetings. Through the meeting, we receive many answers to prayer. We often receive no light individually. But when we come to the meeting, we find light. What we see individually through our own pursuit can never match what we see in the meetings. All the ministries ordained by God operate through the meeting and are for the meeting. If a person rarely meets with others, he will have little opportunity to realize the functioning of the Body.</p>
<p>In addition to being the Body of Christ, the church is also the dwelling place of God. In the Old Testament the light of God was in the Holy of Holies. There was sunlight in the outer court, and there was the lamp with olive oil burning before the veil in the Holy Place. But in the Holy of Holies, there was no natural or artificial light. There was only the light of God. The Holy of Holies is the place where God dwells. Wherever God dwells, there is His light. Today when the church gathers together as the dwelling place of God, we find God&rsquo;s light. When the church meets together, God manifests His light. We do not know why this happens. We can say only that this is one of the results of the mutual functioning of the members. The mutual functioning allows God&rsquo;s light to be expressed through the Body.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 32:30 says, &ldquo;How shall one chase a thousand, / And two put ten thousand to flight, / Were it not that their Rock sold them, / And Jehovah delivered them up?&rdquo; If one could chase a thousand, how could two put ten thousand to flight? This is a strange thing. We do not know how, but we know that this is a fact. According to man, if one can chase a thousand, two should be able to chase only two thousand. But God says two can chase ten thousand, which is eight thousand more. When two chase separately, each can chase a thousand. Putting the two together, we should only have two thousand. But when two are joined together to chase the enemy, we have the mutual functioning of the members, and they can chase ten thousand, eight thousand more than if it is done separately. A person who does not know the Body and who does not care about meeting together will lose the eight thousand. Therefore, we need to learn to receive corporate grace. Do not think that personal grace is enough. We repeat: A special characteristic of Christianity is that it meets. A Christian can never substitute meeting with &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; pursuits. We need to see this clearly and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Lord promises us two kinds of presence. One is in Matthew 28, and the other is in Matthew 18. In Matthew 28:20 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; One can say that this implies His presence in individuals. In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said, &ldquo;For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; His presence here refers to His presence in the meeting. Only in the meeting can we have this second kind of presence. The Lord&rsquo;s presence with an individual and His presence in the meeting are two different things. Some only know the Lord&rsquo;s presence as individuals. But this knowledge is insufficient. The more compelling and powerful presence is experienced only in the meeting; we cannot experience such a presence individually. Although individually we can have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, this presence is never as great or as powerful as His presence in the meetings. But when we are among the saints we can touch a presence which we could not otherwise experience as individuals. We have to learn to meet together with the brothers and sisters because it is in the meeting that we experience the Lord&rsquo;s special presence. This is a tremendous blessing. This presence can never be felt by us as individuals. It is impossible to find a &ldquo;self-taught&rdquo; Christian who can experience this kind of powerful presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>It is a spontaneous thing for God&rsquo;s children to function in mutuality when they come together. We do not know how this mutuality in the Body works in the meeting, but we know that this mutuality is a fact. When one brother stands up, others see the light. When another brother stands up, others feel the Lord&rsquo;s presence. One brother opens his mouth to pray and others touch God. Another brother speaks a few words and others feel the supply of life. This phenomenon cannot be explained by human words; it surpasses human explanation. Only when the Lord comes back will we really know how the Body of Christ functions in mutuality. Today we merely obey the Lord&rsquo;s ordination.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have not paid much attention to the meeting because you have just been saved. You do not know what the light of the Body is and what the function and efficacy of the Body is. However, experience tells us that many fundamental spiritual lessons are learned only in the Body. The more you meet, the more you learn. If you do not meet, you have no part at all in these riches. Therefore, we hope that you will learn to meet properly from the very beginning of your Christian life.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRINCIPLES OF MEETING</h2>
<p>How should we meet? The first principle in the Bible concerning meetings is that all meetings are conducted in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Matthew 18:20 says, &ldquo;Gathered into My name,&rdquo; which can also be translated as, &ldquo;Gathered under My name.&rdquo; What does it mean to be gathered under the Lord&rsquo;s name? It means to be under the Lord&rsquo;s authority. The Lord is the center, and everyone is drawn to Him. We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters. We go to the meeting to be gathered together with other saints under the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Lord is the center. We do not meet to listen to someone&rsquo;s preaching but to meet the Lord. If you meet to listen to someone&rsquo;s preaching, I am afraid you are coming under that person&rsquo;s name, not under the Lord&rsquo;s name. Sometimes, men&rsquo;s names are used to attract people. This is to draw men under that person&rsquo;s name. But the Lord says that we have to meet under His name.</p>
<p>We should come under the Lord&rsquo;s name because the Lord is not with us in a physical sense (Luke 24:5-6). Whenever the Lord is not physically present, there is the need of His name. When the Lord is physically present, there is less of a need for His name. The name is present because the person Himself is not present. As far as His physical body is concerned, the Lord is in heaven. Yet He has left us with a name. The Lord has promised that if we meet under His name, He will be in our midst. This means that His Spirit will be in our midst. Although the Lord is sitting in heaven, His name is still in our midst, and His Spirit is also in our midst. The Holy Spirit is the One who upholds the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Holy Spirit is the guardian of Christ&rsquo;s name; He protects and guards the Lord&rsquo;s name. Wherever there is the name of the Lord, there is the Holy Spirit, and there the Lord&rsquo;s name is manifested. Those who want to meet must meet under the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The second principle of meeting is that its goal should be for the building up of others. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul told us that the basic principle of meeting is to build up others, not ourselves. Everything in the meeting should be for the purpose of building up others, not ourselves. Tongue speaking builds up the speaker, but the interpretation of tongues builds up others. In other words, every move that builds up just one person is in the principle of tongue-speaking. The principle of the interpretation of tongues is to dispense into others what we ourselves have been built up with, that others may also be built up. This is why there should not be any tongue-speaking in the meeting if no one can interpret the tongue. No one should speak anything that builds up himself and not others.</p>
<p>Hence, we must consider others when we meet. It is not how much we say, but whether or not what we say builds up others. Whether or not sisters can ask questions in the meeting is determined by the same principle. Asking questions in the meeting is not just for one&rsquo;s own benefit. It is a matter of whether or not the meeting would be dragged down by such questions. Do you want to help the meeting? The clearest indication of whether or not a man&rsquo;s individuality has been dealt with is seen in the meeting. Some only think of themselves. They have a message in their heart which they want to preach, and they must speak it when they come to the meeting. They have a hymn in their heart which they like to sing, and they will do anything to find an opportunity to sing it. They do not care whether the message will help the meeting or whether the hymn will enliven the congregation. This kind of person brings nothing but damage to the meeting.</p>
<p>Some brothers have been Christians for years, yet they still do not know how to meet. They care little for heaven or earth, the Lord or the Holy Spirit; they only care about themselves. They seem to think that as long as they are present, even alone, they can have a meeting. In their eyes, none of the brothers and sisters exist; they are the only ones who are present. This is truly arrogant. When they speak in the meeting, they want to speak until they are satisfied. In the end they are the only ones who are happy; the other brothers and sisters are all unhappy. They feel that they have a &ldquo;burden&rdquo; which must be released. But as soon as they open their mouths, others are forced to pick up this &ldquo;burden&rdquo; and take it home with them. Some like long prayers. When they pray, others become tired. When someone breaks the principles of the meeting, the whole church suffers. We must not offend the Holy Spirit in a meeting. Once we offend the Holy Spirit, all the blessing is gone. In the meeting, if we take care of the needs of others and try to build up others, the Holy Spirit will be honored. He will do the building up work, and we will be built up. However, if we do not build up others but talk loosely and offend the Holy Spirit, our meeting will be in vain. When we meet, we should not think of getting something out of the meeting for ourselves. All the activities should be for the benefit of others. If you think your speaking will benefit others, you should speak. If you think your silence will benefit others, remain silent. Always try to take care of others; this is the basic principle of meeting together.</p>
<p>This does not mean that everyone should be silent in the meeting. Many times speaking damages others, but silence also damages others. If you do not care for others, the meeting will suffer whether you speak or remain quiet. Your speaking must be for the benefit of the meeting, and your silence must also be for the benefit of the meeting. Always seek the building up of others. Those who should speak should not remain silent. In the meeting, please remember, &ldquo;Let all things be done for building up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). Everyone should come to the meeting with a goal in mind&mdash;he is there for others, not just for himself. We should never do anything that will stumble others. If our silence will stumble others, we should speak. If our speaking will stumble others, we should be silent. We need to learn to speak for the purpose of building up others, and we need to learn to be silent also for the purpose of building up others. Whatever we do, it is for the purpose of building up others, not ourselves. When we are not for ourselves, we will end up being built up ourselves. But when we think only of ourselves, we will not receive any building up.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether your speaking will build up others, the best thing to do is to check with more experienced brothers. You should ask them, &ldquo;Do you think I should speak more or less in the meeting?&rdquo; You have to learn to be a humble person from the beginning. Do not think that you are &ldquo;somebody.&rdquo; Do not think that you can sing and preach well and that you are great. Please do not make any judgment about yourself. The best thing to do is to ask the experienced brothers. Check with them to see whether your speaking builds up others. Speak more if they encourage you to do so. Speak less if they remind you to speak less. Our meeting will be high if everyone humbles himself to learn from others. When this happens, others will sense that God is in our midst when they come in. This is the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit. I hope we will pay attention to this matter. If we do, our meeting will glorify God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Here I should mention another matter. Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ. Let us read some verses:</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>whether</em> means that there is no distinction. In the Body of Christ there are no worldly distinctions. In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were given to drink one Spirit.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27-28 says, &ldquo;For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We were baptized into Christ, and we have also put on Christ. There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female, because we have all become one in Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says, &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; Both Galatians 3:28 and Colossians 3:11 use the phrase <em>there cannot be.</em> There cannot be any distinctions because we have put on the new man; we are being constituted into one new man. This new man is created according to God (Eph. 4:24). In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man. Only Christ is all and in all. There is only one entity, and all have become one.</p>
<p>In reading these three portions of the Scripture, we notice that the believers are one in Christ. In the Lord there is no distinction of past status. In the new man and in the Body of Christ, there is no difference whatsoever. If we introduce these manmade distinctions into the church, the relationship among the brothers and sisters will be shifted to the wrong ground.</p>
<p>We have mentioned five distinctions so far: the distinction between Greek and Jew, between free man and slave, between male and female, between barbarian and Scythian, and between circumcision and uncircumcision.</p>
<p>The distinction between Greek and Jew means two things. First the Jews and the Greeks are two different races; they belong to two different countries. In the Body of Christ, in Christ, and in the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek. The Jews should not boast that they are descendants of Abraham and God&rsquo;s chosen people, and they should not despise all foreigners. We must realize that both Jews and Greeks have been made one in Christ already. Boundaries no longer exist in Christ. In the Lord all have become brothers. We cannot divide God&rsquo;s children into different classes. In the Body of Christ and in the new man, there is only one entity. If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is. You are in the church now, and you must see that we have no distinction between Jew and Greek here. It is a hard thing for the Jews to give up this distinction. But the Bible says that in Christ there cannot be Jew and Greek. Christ is all and in all. In the church there is only Christ.</p>
<p>There is another distinction between the Jews and the Greeks. Jews have a zealous and religious temperament, while Greeks represent an intellectual temperament. Historically, whenever you speak of religion, people think of the Jews. Whenever you speak of science and philosophy, people think of the Greeks. This is a distinction in character. However, no matter how different their characters are, Jews can be Christians, and Greeks also can be Christians. Those who are zealous for religion can be Christians, and those who are intellectual also can be Christians. In Christ, there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks. One is concerned with the feeling of the conscience, and the other is concerned with reasoning and deduction. Are these two different? According to the flesh, they definitely are different in disposition. One acts according to feelings, and the other acts according to intellect. But in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks. A warm person can be a Christian, and a cold person also can be a Christian. The one who walks by intuition can be a Christian, and the one who walks by reason also can be a Christian. All kinds of people can be Christians.</p>
<p>Once you become a Christian, you must leave your past temperament behind. There is no such thing in the church. Often the church suffers because many people try to bring their natural flavor and peculiar traits into the church. When those who do not like to talk gather together, they become a quiet group. When those who chatter gather together, they become a chattering group. When those who are cold gather together, they become a group of cold people. When those who are warm gather together, they become a group of warm people. As a result, many distinctions are built up among God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>However, there is no place for natural dispositions in the church. In Christ and in the new man, there is no place for natural disposition. Do not think that others are wrong because their disposition is different from yours. You must realize that your own disposition is also unacceptable to others. Whether you are quick or quiet, cold or warm, intellectual or emotional, once you become a brother or a sister, you must put off these things. If you bring these natural elements into the church, they will become the basis of confusion and division. When you bring your disposition and temperament into the church, you will make yourself the standard and the criteria. Those who are up to your standard will be classified as good Christians, and those who are not up to your standard will be classified as poor Christians. Those who get along with your character will be deemed right and those who do not get along with your character will be deemed wrong. When this happens, the church will suffer through your disposition and temperament. Such distinctions must never exist in the church.</p>
<p>The second distinction is between free men and slaves. This distinction has also been eliminated in Christ. In Christ, the distinction between free men and slaves does not exist.</p>
<p>Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians during the Roman era when slavery was practiced. At that time slaves were like animals or tools; they were their masters&rsquo; possessions. Children born to slaves were automatically slaves; they had no freedom their whole life. The distinction between the free man and the slave was very great. However, God does not allow this distinction to exist in the church. The Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians all say that there cannot be free man or slave. This distinction has been eliminated in Christ.</p>
<p>The third distinction is between male and female. In Christ and in the new man, the male and the female have the same status; there is no distinction between them. The male does not occupy a special position; neither does the female. Because Christ is all and in all, there is no distinction between male and female. In spiritual matters there is no difference between male and female. A brother is saved by the life of Christ, that is, by the life of God&rsquo;s Son. A sister also is saved by the life of Christ, the life of God&rsquo;s Son. The brother has become God&rsquo;s son, and the sister has become God&rsquo;s son as well. In Christ we are all God&rsquo;s sons, and there is no distinction between male and female.</p>
<p>The fourth distinction is between barbarians and Scythians. This is a distinction of culture. There are differences in cultural standards, yet Paul told us that the cultural distinctions of barbarians and Scythians alike have been abolished in Christ.</p>
<p>Of course, we should learn to be a Jew among Jews, and to be as under law to those under law (1 Cor. 9:20-22). Among people of other cultures, we should behave according to their culture. We should learn to be one with all people in all places. When we contact those of a different culture, we should learn to be one with them in Christ.</p>
<p>The final distinction is between circumcision and uncircumcision. This distinction has to do with marks of piety in the flesh. The Jews have the mark of circumcision on their bodies. It shows that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they reject the flesh. Yet they overemphasize circumcision. Acts 15 speaks of some Jews who tried to compel the Gentiles to be circumcised.</p>
<p>Christians also have their &ldquo;marks of piety in the flesh.&rdquo; For example, baptism, head covering, the breaking of bread, the laying on of hands, and so on can all become marks of piety. Baptism has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh. Head covering with the sisters has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh. Bread-breaking and the laying on of hands have spiritual meanings, but they can also become marks of piety in the flesh. All of these things have spiritual meaning; they are all spiritual matters. However, we may use these things to separate God&rsquo;s children, boasting about marks which others do not have, and the result is disunity. If we do this, we have downgraded these matters from their spiritual level and made them mere physical marks in the flesh. When this happens, we become, in principle, the same as the Jews who boasted in circumcision; our baptism, head covering, bread-breaking, and hand-laying have become our &ldquo;circumcision.&rdquo; If we differentiate between God&rsquo;s children based on these things, we have made distinctions according to the flesh. However, in Christ there is no distinction between circumcision and uncircumcision. No physical mark of the flesh can be used to differentiate God&rsquo;s children. In Christ we are made one. The life in Christ is one. All of these things are outside of the life of Christ. Of course, it is good to have the spiritual reality that accompanies these physical marks. But if one has the spiritual reality yet is lacking in the physical marks, we cannot count him out. God&rsquo;s children should not allow physical marks to damage the oneness in the Lord and the oneness in the new man.</p>
<p>We all are brothers and sisters. We are the new man in Christ. We all are members in the Body, and we all are parts of the Body. Once we are in the church, we should not have any distinction outside of Christ. Everyone stands on new ground. Everyone is in the new man created by the Lord and everyone is in the Body built up by Him. We must see that all of God&rsquo;s children are one. There is no place for superiority or inferiority. We must eliminate the denominational and sectarian thoughts from our hearts. If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints. We have to pay attention to these matters in the meeting, and we have to live out such a life in our daily walk. May God bless us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">VARIOUS KINDS OF MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:14, 40-42; 1 Cor. 10:16-17, 21; 11:20, 23-26; 14:26-36; Matt. 18:19-20</h1>
<p>In the previous message we covered the principles of the meetings. In this message we will cover the practice of the meetings. According to the Bible, there are generally five different kinds of meetings&mdash;the gospel meeting, the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, the meeting for the exercise of the gifts, and the meeting for the preaching of the Word. The Bible shows us these five kinds of meetings during the apostles&rsquo; time. Today, if the church is to be strong, it must have these five kinds of meetings. We must know how to meet in a proper way in each kind of meeting. If we do, we will receive the profit from these meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE GOSPEL MEETING</h2>
<p>In the four Gospels, Acts, and the beginning of church history, the gospel meeting was always a very important meeting. After the church had become degraded, by the third and fourth century, the gospel meeting gradually lost its place and was replaced by teaching meetings. In order for the church to be strong, it must recover the place of the gospel meeting.</p>
<p>The church exists on earth not only for the purpose of building up itself but also so that others might know Christ. As far as the building up of the church is concerned, the gift of the evangelist can be relegated the last place. However, as soon as the church starts to spread out, the gift of the evangelist becomes the first gift. Philip&rsquo;s journey to Samaria in Acts 8 is a strong proof of this. God first sends evangelists out to gain people to Himself with their gifts. We must change our old habit, the habit of meeting only for listening to messages. Instead, we must pay much attention to the gospel meeting.</p>
<p>If a brother learns to participate in the preaching of the gospel immediately after he believes in the Lord, he will not pick up the habit of sitting in pews and listening to messages. Instead, he will pick up the habit of preaching the gospel. In the gospel meeting everyone should participate actively in the work; no one should sit passively to listen to the message with little concern for the salvation of others.</p>
<p>The gospel meeting is a time when the whole church is mobilized. Every brother and sister has his or her responsibility. Everyone should pray much before the meeting. Those brothers who are more advanced in life and prominent in gifts can serve as the oracles for the gospel. The rest of the saints should pray in one accord for the speaking brothers, that the latter may release the gospel with power. It is possible to have two or three brothers speaking at one meeting. But do not try to have more than three. When there are too many speakers, the audience will be confused.</p>
<p>How should a brother or sister come to a gospel meeting?</p>
<p>First, everyone must be clear that the gospel message is not for themselves but for the unbelievers. This may sound simple. But many brothers and sisters who attend the gospel meeting forget that the testifying brother is not testifying to them but to the unbelievers. Never come as a spectator, and never come to the meeting in a cold or uncooperative way. We do not have to be concerned whether the speaking is good or bad. Our goal is to save people and to cooperate with the meeting.</p>
<p>Second, if possible, all the brothers and sisters should attend this meeting. Do not think that since you are saved you no longer need to go to the gospel meeting. It is true that you are saved. But there are things you can do in the gospel meeting. You should go to the meeting not to listen to the gospel but to work. No one should be lazy in the gospel meeting. Some brothers and sisters say, &ldquo;I already understand everything about the gospel. I do not need to come to such a meeting.&rdquo; But coming to the gospel meeting has nothing to do with whether or not you already understand the gospel. You already understand everything about the bread-breaking meeting. Why then do you still go? You must go to the gospel meeting because you need to help the meeting. You also need to go because you have a part in it.</p>
<p>Third, every time there is a gospel meeting, you must bring some people to it. Send out invitations to your friends and relatives. Invite them a few days ahead of time or one to two weeks before the meeting is to be held. Sometimes God will give you the grace, and you can bring ten or twenty people to the meeting. If you have that many, ask others to help you take care of them. Take care of three or four yourself and ask others to take care of the rest. You should not bring any people to the meeting without taking care of them properly.</p>
<p>Do not arrive at a gospel meeting at the last minute. All the ones who attend the gospel meeting must be well prepared ahead of time. Make clear to the ones whom you have invited where you will wait for them. Perhaps you should go to their house and escort them to the meeting. Always give yourself a little more time. Avoid the situation where the meeting has started and yet your friend has not arrived.</p>
<p>Fourth, after bringing a friend to the meeting, take care of him during the meeting.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Sitting beside Him</h2>
<p>An unbeliever does not know where to sit when he comes to the meeting hall. You must let him know where he should sit. If the ushers in the hall have made an arrangement already, you must cooperate with them. If you bring one person to the meeting, you must sit beside him. If you bring two, sit between them. If you bring three or four, sit with one or two on each side of you. Do not take care of more than four people; you will be busy enough taking care of four. If you bring more, ask other brothers or sisters to take care of them. Keep two persons at the most on each side. The way we sit is very important. In the meeting we have to sit beside the invited ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Looking Up the Verses and the Hymns<br />
and Explaining the Terms</h2>
<p>There are many things to do while sitting next to gospel friends. You have to help them find the verses when the Scripture is quoted in a message. If the speaker mentions a word or term that requires explanation, you have to explain it to your friend softly. You have to pick up what the speaker misses. Your voice must not be loud. Speak softly but clearly. A brother once preached the gospel to a big audience. He began by saying, &ldquo;You all know the story of the Israelites coming out of Egypt.&rdquo; Another brother went over to him and said, &ldquo;These people do not know who the Israelites are; nor do they know anything about Egypt.&rdquo; This shows us that it is best for the speaking brother to avoid words that unbelievers do not understand. At the same time, the brothers and sisters who are sitting in the audience should help fill up the lack. If they come across this situation, they should explain to the gospel friends immediately and in a very simple way that the Israelites are Jews, that Egypt is a country, and that the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, but later they came out of Egypt. Explain these things to your friends in a simple way.</p>
<p>You must also look up the hymns for your friends. Many hymns have chorus lines that need to be repeated. You must help your friends repeat these lines.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Paying Attention to Your Friends&rsquo; Response<br />
and Praying for Them</h2>
<p>You have to be watchful before the Lord concerning your friends&rsquo; response. If you feel that the response of the one sitting beside you is not good during the preaching, you can pray in secret, saying, &ldquo;Lord, soften his heart.&rdquo; If you feel that he is proud, you can pray, &ldquo;Lord, break his pride.&rdquo; The success of a gospel meeting in the church depends on the condition of all the brothers and sisters. If all the brothers and sisters attend the gospel meeting and if all participate in the work together, there will be a free way for the gospel to spread. You must pay attention to the new ones and observe their response to the message. These are the ones you have brought to the meeting; you know their condition. Your eyes must be fixed on them, and you must pray for them, saying, &ldquo;Lord, move his heart and make him understand. Lord, touch him. Take away his pride so that he can hear and receive Your word.&rdquo; Sometimes you may feel that the brothers on the podium should say certain things. You may feel that they should talk about certain subjects. You can pray, &ldquo;Lord, cause the brother to speak such a word to meet this man&rsquo;s need.&rdquo; Many times the brother on the podium will say the very words that you have prayed for, as if he has heard your petition. It is important for you to take care of the ones beside you by praying for them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Helping Them to Receive the Lord</h2>
<p>Once you feel that they are touched by the message, you should help them to receive the Lord. You have to usher the word of the Lord into their hearts by prayer. You have to carry God&rsquo;s word to them and capture their heart by praying, &ldquo;Lord, let him hear this word. Lord, let this word hit him hard. Lord, let this word shine so that he may see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the speaker starts &ldquo;pulling in the net,&rdquo; that is, sounding the call, we must encourage them to respond, saying, &ldquo;Please do not miss this opportunity. I hope you will receive the Lord.&rdquo; We must give them a push when we see that they are touched but are hesitating. Since Satan is doing his best to hold them back, it is wrong for us to shy away from pushing them. Satan works in men&rsquo;s hearts to hinder them from receiving the Lord, while we are trying to push them to believe from their heart. In the gospel meeting we need to help our friends receive salvation. When the brother at the podium invites people to receive the Lord, we have to observe our friends&rsquo; reactions closely. If they are touched at all, we have to do our part by saying, &ldquo;You should believe and receive the Lord now. If you do not receive, you will suffer in eternity.&rdquo; Our tone should be serious and sober. This will have an effect on them.</p>
<p>Please remember one principle: In trying to save people, do not analyze whether or not they will be saved. Do not analyze whether or not they are predestinated by God. Our hearts and minds should be set on their receiving salvation. We have to bring them to the Lord and not let them go until they are saved.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Helping Them<br />
to Write Down Their Names</h2>
<p>After the meeting, help them write down their names if there is the need for them to leave their names. Help them write if they do not know how to write. If some ask why they should leave their names, say, &ldquo;We want your name so that we can come and visit you.&rdquo; Write out their addresses clearly. Mark down the area, the street, and the street numbers of their homes so that others can find them when they want to visit them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Leading Them to Pray</h2>
<p>You have helped them up to this point. But your job is not completed yet. You still have to lead them to pray with you. If you cannot make it by yourself, ask other brothers or sisters to help you pray with them. Never be careless. Work on them until you feel at peace to send them home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Bringing Saints Along to Visit Them<br />
until They Are Saved</h2>
<p>After your friends have gone home, you have to visit them. The first time you visit, you should bring one or two brothers or sisters along with you. This is part of your job. When the church arranges for visitation, you have to accompany the brothers and sisters to your friends&rsquo; house and talk to them. It is not enough for certain people to hear the gospel once. You have to invite them a second and third time until they are finally saved.</p>
<p>May the Lord help us take the way of recovery. We should consider the gospel meeting a very important meeting. In this meeting every brother and sister has something to do. Everyone is living; no one is lazy. Everyone is active. Once such an atmosphere is raised up, the church will have a great turn, and the gospel meeting will become a working meeting for the whole church.</p>
<p>If the number of people in a local church is small and the format of the meeting simple, one does not have to follow all the details given above. But in principle, every brother and sister should have great regard for the gospel meeting. Everyone is responsible, and everyone should actively advance the gospel and bring people to salvation in one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10 and 11 the Bible speaks of two things concerning the bread-breaking meeting. When Paul speaks of the bread in 11:24, he refers to the Lord&rsquo;s physical body, saying, &ldquo;And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s body was given up for us. Through this our sins were forgiven, and we obtained life. The basic thought in this verse is to remember the Lord. First Corinthians 10:17 provides another view, saying, &ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.&rdquo; The bread in chapter eleven denotes the Lord&rsquo;s physical body, while the bread in chapter ten denotes us. In other words, chapter eleven emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord, while chapter ten emphasizes our fellowship among God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Hence, we see two significant aspects of the bread-breaking meeting. One is upward towards heaven; we remember the Lord. Another is centered on the bread on the table, which signifies us, the children of God, having fellowship with each other. Each one of us has a part in this bread. We are all part of this one bread. You have received the Lord and so have I. This entitles us to the same fellowship in the Lord. Hence, the breaking of bread signifies our coming to the Lord to fellowship with Him, as well as our coming together in fellowship with the children of God.</p>
<p>Every bread-breaking meeting should have two sections, because there are two parts to our salvation. In the first part of our salvation, we discovered that we were sinners, destined for judgment and death. But the Lord had mercy on us. He came to this earth and died for us. The Lord saved us and shed His blood to forgive us. Our sins were forgiven once we accepted the Lord Jesus&rsquo; blood. This is the first part of our salvation. But salvation does not stop here. After we are saved, the Lord Jesus becomes ours and we belong to Him. He brings us before God and makes His Father our Father. The Holy Spirit within also teaches us to cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; (Rom. 8:14-16). This is the second part of salvation. In other words, the first section of salvation has to do with the Lord, and the second section has to do with the Father. In the first section we are forgiven. In the second section we are accepted by God. When we are saved, we become related to the Lord; this is the first part of the story. In the second part we become related to God. We approach the Lord from the position of being a sinner, and through Him we come to the Father. First we meet the Lord, and then we meet the Father. This is why the Bible says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also&rdquo; (1 John 2:23). Salvation has to do with the Son; it is something to do with the Lord. Salvation also has to do with the Father; this is something that has to do with God. No one can come to the Father except through the Son. First we have to come to the Lord. First we must come to the cross to receive forgiveness, to have the righteous One take the place of the unrighteous, before we can be brought by the Lord to the Father. Hence, we do not come to the Father to receive salvation. Rather, we come to the Son to obtain salvation. Then we come to the Father. First we are forgiven, then we are accepted. We must see this clearly.</p>
<p>The bread-breaking meeting is for remembering the Lord. Since the Lord&rsquo;s salvation consists of two parts, the bread-breaking meeting should also have two parts. Before breaking the bread, we remember the Son. After breaking the bread, we turn our attention to the Father. The part before breaking the bread is for the Lord, and the part after breaking the bread is for God.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord, we find out that we were sinners. We were sons of disobedience, sons of wrath under God&rsquo;s judgment. We had no way to save ourselves. But because the Lord Jesus shed His blood for our redemption, we can come before the Lord to receive His life. When we were sinners, we came to the Lord. When we saw how our sins were forgiven, we also came to Him. Hence, during the first part of the bread-breaking meeting, all our hymns, thanksgiving, and praises should be directed toward the Lord.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord, we should offer thanksgiving and praises to Him. Strictly speaking, we should not do anything other than offer thanksgiving and praises. It is improper to petition for anything in this meeting. We cannot ask the Lord to shed His blood for us. This has already been accomplished; there is no longer any need to ask for this. We just have to praise and give thanks. Whether it is through praying or singing, we should only thank and praise Him. Thanksgiving is directed at the Lord&rsquo;s work, while praise is directed at the Lord Himself. We give thanks for what He has done, and we praise Him for what He is. At the beginning there is more thanksgiving. But gradually we turn to praise. As we give thanks we also praise. We see what a wonderful work He has done for us, and we also see what a wonderful Savior He is. After we have offered up enough thanksgiving, we should begin to praise. When our praise reaches the peak, then is the time for us to break bread.</p>
<p>The second part begins after we break bread. The Lord does not want us to stop once we have come to Him. We must receive the Lord, but it does not stop there. It is wonderful that the Father received us when we received the Lord. We have to be clear about this. Through the gospel, we receive the Lord, not the Father. The Bible does not say that we should receive the Father. It always says that we should receive the Son. Nevertheless, we ourselves are received by the Father. Because we receive the Son, the Father considers us acceptable. To receive the Son is the first half of salvation. When the Father receives us, salvation is complete. The Son is the One we receive; this is the first half. God is the One who receives us; this completes the other half. Hence, after breaking the bread, we go to the Father. We have received and met the Lord. Now He brings us to the Father. This is the second part of our bread-breaking meeting. We should go to God and praise Him in this part of the meeting.</p>
<p>Psalm 22 has two sections. The first section is from verse 1 through verse 21, which speaks of how the Lord bore our shame, how He suffered pain, and how He was forsaken by the Father. This section refers to the Lord&rsquo;s death for us on the cross. The second section begins from verse 22 and continues until the end. This section speaks of the Lord leading His many &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in their praise to God in the midst of the assembly. In other words, the first section is our remembrance of the Lord, and the second section is the Lord bringing us to the Father to praise Him.</p>
<p>On the day the Lord Jesus resurrected, He said to Mary, &ldquo;I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (John 20:17). In earlier chapters in the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus addressed the Father as &ldquo;My Father&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; But here He says, &ldquo;My Father and your Father.&rdquo; When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection into us, His Father becomes our Father. The three parables in Luke 15 show us the good Shepherd and then the loving Father. The good Shepherd comes to seek us, whereas the loving Father waits for us at home. The good Shepherd left His home to seek the lost sheep, but the loving Father accepts us at home. We have met the good Shepherd. Now we are going to meet the Father. Therefore, during the second part of the meeting, all hymns and prayers should be directed toward the Father. We meet the Son during the first part of the bread-breaking meeting. During the second part, the Lord brings us to the Father. The Holy Spirit is the One who conducts the meeting, and He always conducts us this way in this meeting. The leading of the Holy Spirit will not go against the principle of salvation. We need to learn to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. If we give Him the freedom, He will lead us in such a way.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 shows us that the Lord Jesus is bringing many sons into glory. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was the only begotten Son of God; He was the only One. But He died and resurrected. Now we have received Him and have become God&rsquo;s sons. The Lord Jesus is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; The meeting spoken of in Hebrews 2 is the meeting of the firstborn Son with the many sons singing praises to the Father. The second part of the bread-breaking meeting is precisely this meeting of the firstborn Son with the many sons. We should learn to raise our spirit to the peak in this part of the meeting. The second part of the bread-breaking meeting is the best time on earth for us to sing praises to the Father. We need to learn to raise our spirits to the height in this section of the meeting.</p>
<p>God is enthroned &ldquo;upon the praises of Israel&rdquo; (Psa. 22:3). The more the church of God praises, the more it touches the throne. The more a person praises, the more he knows the throne. Let us read together one stanza of a hymn:</p>
<p class="hbody">Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all Thine own;<br />
And in Thy presence sound a note of praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thee alone;<br />
Bro&rsquo;t nigh, bro&rsquo;t home to Thee&mdash;O wondrous grace,<br />
That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>Hymns,</em> #52)</p>
<p>This is a very good hymn. It touches the sentiment of the Son leading many sons to the praise of the Father. It is difficult to find another song like this one.</p>
<p>The meeting spoken of in Hebrews 2 is the best meeting. Today we are learning a little. One day, when we are in heaven, we will meet to our delight and satisfaction. But before we enter into glory, we should experience the firstborn Son leading many sons to praise the Father and experience praising the Father in the midst of the church. This is the highest peak that a church meeting can ever reach. It is something very glorious.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PRAYER MEETING</h2>
<p>The gospel meeting and the bread-breaking meeting are important meetings, and the prayer meeting is also important. Every kind of meeting has its own characteristic and place. The prayer meeting can be considered as both an easy meeting and a very difficult meeting. New believers should learn some lessons in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Praying in One Accord</h2>
<p>The basic requirement for brothers and sisters to pray together is to be in one accord. In Matthew 18 the Lord tells us to be in harmony, that is, in one accord. The prayer in Acts 1 was also a prayer in one accord. Hence, the first condition for carrying out a prayer meeting is to have the one accord. No one should come to the prayer meeting with a different mind. If we want to have a prayer meeting, we must ask in one accord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 18:19). This is a very strong word. In Greek the word <em>harmony</em> refers to music. Consider three persons&mdash;one playing the piano, another playing the accordion, and the third playing the flute. When they play together and one plays out of tune, the sound will be very irritating. The Lord wants all of us to pray in harmony, not with different tunes. If we can be in harmony, then whatever we ask, God will accomplish. Whatever we bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever we loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. The basic condition is to be in harmony. We must learn to be in harmony before God. We should not pray capriciously with everyone still holding to his or her own idea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Specific</h2>
<p>How can our prayers be in harmony? Perhaps the biggest problem in our prayer meeting is that we bring up too many subjects. Once there are too many subjects in the prayer meeting, it is impossible to have harmony. Some prayer meetings have so many subjects that the meetings are an all-inclusive bazaar. We cannot find such a meeting in the Bible. What we see in the Bible is men praying for specific matters. When Peter was imprisoned, the church prayed for him fervently (Acts 12:5). They did not pray for many things but for one specific thing. When the subject is specific, it is easy to pray in harmony.</p>
<p>It is better to pray for only one thing in every prayer meeting. We may pray specifically for a brother or a sister, or we may pray specifically for sickness among the brothers and sisters. In these cases, it is better to pray for one brother&rsquo;s or one sister&rsquo;s sickness or to just pray concerning sickness among the brothers and sisters. We should not mention other subjects in addition to sickness. At other times, we may pray specifically for the brothers and sisters who are in need, or we may pray specifically for the brothers and sisters who are spiritually weak. If there is only one subject, it is easier for us to be in one accord.</p>
<p>If there is still time after we have prayed thoroughly over one subject, we can bring up another subject for prayer. But we should never mention more than one subject at the beginning of our prayer. It is confusing when there are too many subjects. The responsible brothers should only mention one subject at a time. If there is more time later, they can mention other subjects. We should pray for only one thing at a time. The greatest need in the prayer meeting is to have a clear subject.</p>
<p>According to Acts 1 and 2, Pentecost was brought in through the power of prayer. Please remember that the cross was the work of the Son of God, while Pentecost was the work of the children of God. How did such a great work occur? It came through prayer in one accord. Let us learn to concentrate our prayer on specific subjects, not on many items.</p>
<p>If we want to be specific, everyone who comes to the prayer meeting should come with some preparation. We should try the best to inform the brothers and sisters ahead of time concerning the items for prayer. Let them receive the burden first before they come together to pray. First we need to have feeling and burden. Then we come together to pray.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Genuine</h2>
<p>Another basic requirement is to be genuine in our prayer. I am afraid that many words in the prayer meeting are spoken in vain. Many people pay attention to the nicety of the words and care little whether or not God listens to them. It seems to be of little consequence to them that God does not listen to their prayers. Such prayers in the prayer meeting are often artificial and vain.</p>
<p>Genuine prayer is the result of a desire that comes from the heart. It is something that flows out from our inner being. Genuine prayer is not made up of flippant and nice words. Only genuine words that flow out from the deepest part of the heart can be considered as genuine prayer. The goal of our prayer should be an answer from God rather than pleasing the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>If we are not genuine in our prayer, we cannot expect the church to be strong. In order for the church to be strong, the prayer meeting must be strong. In order for the prayer meeting to be strong, all the prayers have to be genuine; no prayer should be artificial. If we are not genuine, we cannot expect to receive anything from God.</p>
<p>Prayer is not a sermon; it is not a speech. To pray is to ask the Lord for something. We do not need to speak many words before God in the prayer meeting, as if God knows nothing and needs to be informed of all the details. We do not need to make a report or preach a message to Him. We pray because we have a need and because we are weak. We want to receive spiritual supply and power through prayer. The amount of genuine prayer we have depends on the amount of need that we feel. If we do not feel any need, our prayers will be vain prayers.</p>
<p>One basic reason for vain prayers is that a person is too conscious of others in the prayer meeting. As soon as we pay attention to others, our prayer is easily filled with vain words. On the one hand, our prayer in the prayer meeting is offered on behalf of the whole meeting. On the other hand, we have to pray as if we were alone before God; we have to pray to God in a genuine way according to our needs.</p>
<p>The more urgent our need is, the more genuine our prayer will be. The Lord Jesus once gave an illustration. A man had a visitor to his house, but he ran out of bread. So he went to his friend for bread. The need was urgent; he had no bread. After asking persistently, the other friend gave in to his need. The Lord Jesus then said, &ldquo;For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened&rdquo; (Luke 11:10). If the need is urgent and we ask properly, it shall be given to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Short</h2>
<p>Our prayers must be genuine, and they must be short. Almost all the prayers in the Bible are short. The prayer taught by the Lord in Matthew 6 is quite short. Although the prayer offered by the Lord in John 17 before He departed from the world is quite long, it is much shorter than the prayers of some of God&rsquo;s children today. The prayer in Acts 4 was the prayer of the whole church; it also was quite short. The prayer in Ephesians 1 is very important, yet it is short. One does not need five minutes to finish that prayer.</p>
<p>Many prayers in the prayer meeting are vain and unreal because they are too long. Perhaps two or three sentences out of the whole prayer are genuine, but the rest are redundant. Those two or three sentences are for God, but the rest are for the brothers and sisters. These prayers drag the meeting on. New believers should forget about the long prayers of the old-timers. They should offer short prayers instead. Not all the brothers and sisters can pray long prayers. If we continue to pray long prayers, the church will suffer great loss.</p>
<p>D. L. Moody once reacted in a very wise way to a sister who was offering a very long prayer in the meeting. As her prayer consumed the patience of the whole congregation, Moody stood up and said, &ldquo;While our sister is still praying, let us sing hymn number so-and-so.&rdquo; A long prayer saps the strength of the prayer meeting. Suppose you pray five minutes longer than you should and another does the same thing. When more and more people pray long prayers, the meeting drags on and is weighted down. Charles Spurgeon once said that the most improper thing for anyone to do is to ask God for forgiveness of shortcomings in the midst of a long prayer. Mackintosh also put it well when he said, &ldquo;Do not try to torture God&rsquo;s children with your prayer.&rdquo; There are many people who whip others, not with a whip, but with long prayers. The more they pray, the more uncomfortable others become. We should learn to offer short and genuine prayers whenever we meet together.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Not Offering Prayers That Exceed<br />
Our Individual Prayers</h2>
<p>Another principle in the prayer meeting is to not offer prayers that go beyond our personal prayer. This is a good principle. The way you pray in the meeting should be governed by the way you pray at home by yourself. Of course, prayer in the meeting is a little different; it should not be exactly the same as your personal prayer. But in principle do not allow your public prayers to exceed your private prayers. The way you pray in the meeting should be almost the same as the way you pray in your private prayer. Do not pray one way in your private prayer and another way in the meeting. Actually, it is difficult to have artificial private prayers, but many prayers in the meeting are artificial. If you go to a prayer meeting and constantly use words that you do not use in your private prayers, your prayers are bound to be artificial.</p>
<p>As far as accomplishing anything is concerned, the prayer in the meeting is always more effective than private prayers. God answers the prayer of the church more readily than He answers individual prayers. But today we receive more answers to private prayers than assembly prayers because there are too many false and vain prayers in the meeting. Actually, there should be more answers to corporate prayers than answers to individual prayers; there should be not only more but very much more. If God&rsquo;s children come together, and everyone prays in a simple, specific, genuine, and harmonious way, there will be more answers to our prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE MEETING FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>The gifts found in every local church are different. God gives certain localities the gift of prophecy, words of revelation and teachings. Sometimes He adds speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues. In some localities God gives only the gifts of the teachers but not miraculous gifts. In other localities He gives both miraculous gifts and the teaching of the word. We cannot dictate what God should do in the church. However, the principle of meeting is always the same&mdash;God wants all His children to exercise their gifts in the meeting. We cannot function according to what we do not have; we can only function according to the gifts that we do have. For this reason, a locality cannot insist on having a meeting for the exercise of the gifts; nor can it imitate other churches in any way. It can function only according to the gifts the brothers in that locality possess. This is the kind of meeting spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14. We should follow the Scripture in conducting this kind of meeting for the functioning of the gifts. The sisters should not open their mouths (v. 34), and the brothers should be restricted (vv. 32-33). If there is any prophesying, let there be only two or three. Some may ask questions and seek mutual building up and enlightening from the Lord. In such meetings there should not be the speaking in tongues unless there is the interpretation of tongues. Tongues are for the building up of individuals before God. Speaking in tongues plus the interpretation of tongues equals prophesying. If there is only speaking in tongues without the interpretation of tongues, the mind will be unfruitful, and the church will not be built up. This is why Paul said, &ldquo;If there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church&rdquo; (v. 28). He did not forbid speaking in tongues, but he forbade any speaking in tongues that was without interpretation. Simply put, in this kind of meeting, whether one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation, <em>all things should be donefor building up.</em></p>
<p>We have to pay particular attention before God to remind all the gifted brothers who serve in the ministry of the word to not become passive in this meeting. The brothers who are gifted in the ministry of the word often become spectators in this meeting. They become passive and allow others to speak. This is wrong. Not everyone can speak in such meetings. Only those who are gifted can speak. We disagree with one man speaking, but we also disagree with anyone speaking. It is wrong to permit only one man to speak. It is also wrong to permit just anyone to speak. Only the speaking of the gifted ones will render supply to the brothers and sisters; not everyone can do the same thing. Only those who have the word can speak. Those who do not should keep quiet. Unfortunately, the gifted brothers who have the ministry often have an improper attitude towards such meetings. They think that every brother and sister can open their mouth in this meeting, and so they sit back. Actually, this meeting is for every brother <em>who is gifted and who has the ministry</em> to stand up and speak. How can we expect to have a good meeting if all those who are supposed to be the mouths do not speak, hoping instead that the hands, legs, and ears will speak? In such a meeting, all the gifted brothers should bear the responsibility to seek before the Lord for something to speak. Once they have the word, they should speak.</p>
<p>Such meetings do pose some difficulty for the new believers; they do not know whether they are gifted or not. They have little to do with the ministry of the word. They have just believed in the Lord, and there is little they can do. How can they participate in this meeting? I hope the mature ones will not shut up the younger ones&rsquo; mouths. We should give them an opportunity to speak. We should tell them, &ldquo;We do not know whether or not you are a gift. We do not know whether God has given you the ministry of the word. So in the beginning, please be simple as you are learning to speak.&rdquo; You must give them an opportunity, but you should not give them too much opportunity. You will bury their gift if you do not give them the opportunity. But if you give them too much opportunity, they will spoil the meeting. Let them open their mouths, but tell them to be brief and simple. If they are gifted, you must tell them, &ldquo;You can speak longer next time.&rdquo; To certain ones you need to say, &ldquo;Your speaking is too long. Please be shorter next time.&rdquo; You must encourage the gifted ones to go on and somewhat restrict the ones who are not gifted. In this way the meeting will become strong without shutting the mouths of any brothers. New believers should learn to be humble. They must open their mouths more when they are being encouraged and open their mouths less when they are reminded to stop. They should follow the leading of the more mature brothers.</p>
<p>The responsible brothers in the church must not only perfect the more advanced ones but also constantly look for new gifts. How do you discover a gift? The gifts are manifested in the meeting through the functioning of the gifts. In this meeting, open your eyes to those who have a mark of the Lord&rsquo;s operation. You have to learn of the condition of these ones. Encourage them if they should be encouraged, and restrict them if they should be restricted. As a consequence, the new believers will not only be helped but also be able to help others in such a meeting. You will then guide the meeting onto the proper course.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE MEETING FOR THE PREACHING OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>The fifth type of meeting may not be as crucial as the other meetings, but it is used equally by God to release His word to the saints. If an apostle passes through our place or if we have apostles, teachers, prophets, or ministers of the word permanently residing among us, we should have a meeting for the release of the word. We are not saying that this kind of meeting is unimportant. We are saying that this kind of meeting is the simplest of all meetings. A meeting where people come to listen to the word is the simplest kind of meeting, but like other meetings, there is much to be learned. Do not be late for the meeting and cause others to wait for you. Obey the ushers, and sit where you are told; do not choose your own seat. If you have some physical handicap in listening or seeing, explain to the ushers so that they can choose a suitable seat for you. Bring your own Bible and hymnal.</p>
<p>On the spiritual side, your heart must be open when you come to such meetings. Prejudiced ones need not come to this meeting, because the word will be useless to them. If a man shuts up his heart to God, he cannot expect to receive any grace from Him. Every listener of the word should pay attention to this matter. Half of the responsibility of a message rests with the speaker, and the other half rests with the listeners. It is impossible for a speaker to try to deliver a message to closed hearts or to those who purposely reject the message.</p>
<p>The spirit, as well as the heart, needs to be open. It is important for the spirit to be open in such a meeting. When a genuine minister of the word speaks, his spirit is open. But if he touches more open spirits in the meeting, his spirit will become strengthened when it is released. If the spirit of the meeting is stifled, indifferent, or closed, the spirit of the speaker will be like the dove outside the ark, flying around the ark only to return to it later. The spirit of the meeting needs to be open, and the spirit of the minister needs to be released. The more open the spirit of the meeting is, the more released the spirit of the prophet will be. If the spirit of the audience is not open, the spirit of the prophet cannot be released. We need to learn to be pliable and to open up our spirit. Let the Holy Spirit be released. We should not surround ourselves with cold and stubborn opinions. We should be a plus to the meeting instead of a hindrance to the spirit of the meeting. Our spirits should draw out the spirit of the speaker instead of frustrating it. If every brother and sister would learn this lesson, our meeting would become stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>These are the biblical patterns of the different kinds of meetings. We have to learn how to behave in every one of these five kinds of meetings. We should not be loose. May God have mercy on us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:10; Psa. 118:22-24; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1-2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM THE SABBATH DAY</h2>
<p>God completed the creation of all things in six days and rested from all His work on the seventh day. Twenty-five hundred years later, He gave the Ten Commandments (Exo. 20:1-17). The fourth commandment reminds man to remember the Sabbath. In other words, it reminds man to remember God&rsquo;s work. This remembrance reminds man that God spent six days to restore the earth and then rested on the seventh day. The seventh day was originally God&rsquo;s day of rest. Twenty-five hundred years later, God gave the seventh day to man as the Sabbath day and told man to rest on this day.</p>
<p>Everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the coming good things (Heb. 10:1). Like all other types in the Old Testament, the Sabbath which God gave man has its spiritual significance. God created man on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day. As soon as man was created, he did not enter into work but into God&rsquo;s rest. God worked six days and then rested one day. But when man came, there were not six days followed by one day, but one day followed by six days. Man rested first and then worked. This is the principle of the gospel. The Sabbath is a type of the gospel. Salvation comes first; work comes later. First we have life; then we have the walk. Rest comes before the work and the walk. This is the gospel. God shows us that He has already prepared the rest of redemption. After we enter into it, we work. Thank God, we work because we first have rested.</p>
<p>The significance of the Sabbath is that man stops his work and enters into God&rsquo;s rest. For man to enter God&rsquo;s rest means that man does not do his own work but instead accepts God&rsquo;s work. Therefore, it is a great sin to break the Sabbath. If you work when God asks you not to work, you have rejected God&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>Breaking the Sabbath is like Moses smiting the rock with the rod. God commanded Moses to &ldquo;speak to the rock before their eyes that it may yield its water&rdquo; (Num. 20:8). God did not ask him to smite the rock with the rod. The rock should not have been smitten a second time; it had already been smitten once (Exo. 17:1-6). The work had already been done, and he should not have tried to do it again. Doing anything again means to overthrow the accomplished work. Moses should have obeyed God&rsquo;s word and commanded the rock to yield the water. Smiting the rock a second time meant that he was denying God&rsquo;s first work. Moses disobeyed God&rsquo;s command. As a result, he could not enter the land of Canaan (Num. 20:7-12).</p>
<p>To man, breaking the Sabbath does not seem to be a great matter. But in God&rsquo;s truth, it is a great matter. Man should enjoy God&rsquo;s rest first and then work. He should receive the gospel first and then have the walk. Man should only do God&rsquo;s work after he has enjoyed God&rsquo;s rest. If he breaks the Sabbath, he is violating the divinely ordained principle. This is why the Sabbath occupies such an important place in the Old Testament. The Old Testament records the story of a person who collected firewood on the Sabbath. When this was discovered, the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death. This person had broken God&rsquo;s Sabbath (Num. 15:32-36). A man who does not rest is one who thinks that he can work and act by himself; he thinks that he does not need God&rsquo;s work. God, however, is satisfied with His work. Keeping the Sabbath means that man is also satisfied with God&rsquo;s work. Keeping the Sabbath means that man rests in God&rsquo;s rest and accepts His work. This is why God commanded in the Old Testament that no work be done on the Sabbath. This is what the Old Testament shows us.</p>
<p>However, <em>the situation is different in the New Testament.</em> On the Sabbath the Lord Jesus went to the synagogue and read the Scripture (Luke 4:16); He went to the synagogue and taught people (Mark 1:21). The apostles also went to the synagogue to reason about the Scriptures on the Sabbath (Acts 17:1-3; 18:4). This shows us that there was not only a passive rest on the Sabbath but also an <em>active work</em> on this day. Originally it was a day of physical rest, but in the New Testament it becomes a day of spiritual pursuit. This is an <em>improvement</em> from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that God&rsquo;s revelation in the Bible is progressive. In the message on &ldquo;Reading the Bible&rdquo; in chapter nine, we said that we need to learn the facts when we read the Bible because there is light in the facts. Once the facts change, it means there is new light. This is what happens in the case of the Sabbath. Initially the Scripture said, &ldquo;God blessed the seventh day&rdquo; (Gen. 2:3), but the Scripture calls the day the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead &ldquo;the first day of the week&rdquo; (Matt. 28:1). It does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected on the seventh day but that He resurrected on the first day of the week. All the four Gospels show us that the Lord Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week. At least five of Jesus&rsquo; appearances after His resurrection were on the first day of the week (John 20:1, 11-19; Matt. 28:1-9; Luke 24:1, 13-15, 34, 36). In Acts the outpouring of the Holy Spirit took place on the day of Pentecost, which was the day following the Sabbath (Lev. 23:15-16), the first day of the week. The first day of the week is the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We will speak more about it later. Of course, this does not mean that God wants to replace the Sabbath with the Lord&rsquo;s Day. But the Bible clearly shows us that God is turning our attention to the first day of the week.</p>
<p>We mentioned earlier that the Sabbath is a type of the gospel. The type of the gospel goes away when the reality of the gospel comes. The gospel is the principle behind the Sabbath, just as the cross is the principle behind the sacrifice. In the Old Testament the sacrificial bull and lamb are types of the Lamb of God&mdash;the Lord Jesus. The bull and the lamb are not needed now that the Lord Jesus has come. Today if a man still brings a bull or a lamb to sacrifice to God, he is ignorant of the cross. How can a man offer up a bull or a lamb when the Lord has already become the offering? Likewise, the gospel has already come. Man can now rest in God through the gospel. God has accomplished all His work through His Son&rsquo;s redemption on the cross. Therefore, He does not charge us to work first but to rest. We should rest in the work of His Son. We do not come to God to do any work; we come to Him to rest. The gospel ushers us into rest in God. We serve only after we rest. After the gospel, rest is brought in, and the Sabbath is spontaneously annulled for the believers just as the sacrifice of bulls and lambs was annulled. The Sabbath is over for us just as the sacrifice of bulls and lambs is over. The Sabbath is a type in the Old Testament; this type has already been fulfilled in the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE BASIS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God chose one day out of seven, the seventh day, to be the Holy Sabbath. In the New Testament the principle of choosing one day out of seven still continues. Of course, the seventh day which was kept in the Old Testament is over. But the New Testament has its own day. The Sabbath day has not become the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In the Old Testament God chose the seventh day of the week. In the New Testament He chose <em>the first day</em> of the week. He did not call the seventh day the first day. He chose another day. This day is altogether different from the Sabbath day in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Psalm 118:22-24 is a very crucial portion of the Word. It says, &ldquo;The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner. / This is from Jehovah, / And it is wonderful in our sight. / This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it.&rdquo; Here we see the phrase <em>the stone which the builders rejected.</em> A builder decides whether or not a stone is useful. If the builder says that a stone cannot be used, it is discarded. But here is a wonderful thing: God has made Him&mdash;&ldquo;the stone which the builders rejected&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the head of the corner,&rdquo; that is, the foundation. God has placed the most important duty upon Him. &ldquo;This is from Jehovah, / And it is wonderful in our sight.&rdquo; This is indeed wonderful. Verse 24 tells us something more wonderful: &ldquo;This is the day that Jehovah has made; / Let us exult and rejoice in it.&rdquo; This means that the day that Jehovah has made is the very day in which the stone, rejected by the builders, became the head of the corner. Although the builders rejected the stone, Jehovah did a wonderful thing on that day. He caused the stone to become the head of the corner. This then is the day that Jehovah has made.</p>
<p>We need to know what day is the day that Jehovah has made. What is the actual day that the stone rejected by the builders became the head of the corner? What day is this day? Acts 4:10-11 says, &ldquo;Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health. This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.&rdquo; Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead.&rdquo; Verse 11 says, &ldquo;The stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.&rdquo; In other words, the stone became the cornerstone at the very time of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. The time of the builders&rsquo; rejection was the time that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, while the time of His being made the cornerstone was the time that God raised Him from among the dead. Therefore, &ldquo;the day that Jehovah has made&rdquo; is the day of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. The One rejected by man has been raised up by God. This resurrection is &ldquo;from Jehovah.&rdquo; The day of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection is the day that Jehovah has made. It is wonderful in our sight because this day was not made by man but by Jehovah. What is the day that Jehovah has made? It is the day the Lord Jesus resurrected.</p>
<p>Here we see that our Lord&rsquo;s Day is totally different from the Sabbath of the Old Testament. On the Old Testament Sabbath day, one could not do this or that; everything was negative. If a man broke the Sabbath, he would be put to death. This is a very heavy punishment. But we do not have this stigma today. God prophesied that He would choose another day in the New Testament age. God did not say what could or could not be done on that day. Rather, He told us what should be done. God wants us to exult and rejoice on the day that He has made. Therefore, the special characteristic of the Lord&rsquo;s Day is that there is only a positive charge; there are no negative commandments.</p>
<p>We would like to consider this day a little more. God groups the days not only into months and years but also into weeks. Every seven days is one unit, ending on the seventh day. Earlier we have said that the Sabbath is a type and that it belongs to the old creation. The new creation began when the Lord resurrected. The old creation ended on the seventh of seven days. This clearly completes the week. The beginning of the new creation was on the first of the seven days, which clearly and plainly signifies a new beginning. The first week was completely old, and the second week is completely new. There is a clear and definite separation between the old creation and the new creation. The week is not divided into two parts, with one part old and the other part new. One week is completely of the old creation, and the next week is completely of the new creation. We do not have a partial week, only a complete week. The Lord Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week, and that whole week completely belongs to the new creation. The church on earth came into being on the day of Pentecost, which also fell on the first day of the week. This also signifies something brand new. If the Lord Jesus had not resurrected on the first day of the week but instead on the seventh day or any other day, there would have been a new creation for part of the week and an old creation for part of the week; the division would not have been that clear-cut. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was on the first day of the week, which was the beginning of a new week. One week belongs to the old creation, and the other week belongs to the new creation. The things of the old creation stopped on the last day of the week, the seventh day. The new creation began on the first day of another week. Consequently, the new creation has been clearly separated from the old creation.</p>
<p>God purposely picks one day out of seven and calls it by a special name. Revelation 1:10 calls it <em>the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</em> Some say that &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; is &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo; spoken of elsewhere in the Bible. But this is wrong. In the original text &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo; are two completely different things. &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; is the first day of the week, while &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo; is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (1 Thes. 5:2; 2 Thes. 2:2; 2 Pet. 3:10). These two are completely different. The writings of the early church fathers give us ample proof that &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; refers to the first day of the week. This is also the day for the church to meet. Some say that Christians in the second and third centuries met on the Sabbath day and only changed to the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the fourth century. This is not according to fact. There are many examples in the writings of the early church fathers which prove that the meetings were always held on the first day of the week. This was true from the time of the disciples of John until the fourth century. (Please refer to the appendix at the end of this chapter.)</p><h2 class="head1">III. WHAT WE SHOULD DO ON THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY</h2>
<p>The Bible emphasizes three things that we should do on the first day of the week:</p>
<p>First, Psalm 118:24 speaks of the attitude that all God&rsquo;s children should have on the first day of the week. It is to exult and rejoice. Our Lord has risen from the dead. This is the day that Jehovah has made, and we must exult and rejoice on this day. We must maintain this attitude. This day is the day on which our Lord resurrected. There is no other day similar to this day. The Lord appeared to the disciples and met with them on the first day of the week. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost also occurred on the first day of the week. The rejecting of the stone by the builders and its becoming the cornerstone refer to the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection. The rejection of the Jews was the rejection of the builders, and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was His becoming the cornerstone. This is the day which Jehovah has made, and we should exult and rejoice in it. This should be our spontaneous reaction.</p>
<p>Second, Acts 20:7 says, &ldquo;And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread...&rdquo; According to the original text, <em>the first day of the week</em> here does not refer to the first day of a certain particular week. It means that they met to break bread on the first day of <em>every</em> week. At that time all the churches spontaneously gathered together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord on the first day of the week. Is there any other day better than the first day of the week? The first day of the week is the day our Lord rose from the dead. The first day of the week is also the day we meet our Lord. One thing we must do on the first day of the week is remember the Lord. This is the day that the Lord has chosen. The first thing we should do on the first day of the week is go to the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s Day is the first day of the week. Monday is the second day of the week. We need to meet the Lord on the first day of the week.</p>
<p>The breaking of bread signifies two things in the Bible: the remembrance of the Lord and the declaration of our fellowship with all the children of God. First, it is the declaration of our fellowship with God, our fellowship with the Lord, and second, it is the declaration of our fellowship with the Body, that is, our fellowship with the church. The bread represents the Lord as well as the church. The Lord&rsquo;s Day is the best day for us to have fellowship with the Lord. It is also the best day for us to have fellowship with all the children of God. Although on earth we are limited by time and space from fellowshipping with every child of God and from shaking hands with all of them, every Lord&rsquo;s Day every child of God puts his hand on this bread, regardless of where he is. Every child of God touches this bread. When we touch this bread, we have fellowship with all the children of God. We meet not only the Lord but also all our brothers and sisters. In the meeting we fellowship not only with the brothers and sisters who break bread together with us but also with all those who are touching this bread. On this day, thousands and millions of believers in the whole world are touching this bread. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:17). We break the bread together, and we have fellowship in this bread.</p>
<p>As a new believer you must learn to remove all barriers between yourself and other children of God. You need to learn to love and to forgive right from the beginning. You cannot touch this bread if you do not learn to love and forgive. You should not hate any of the children of God. There should not be any barrier between you and them; none of God&rsquo;s children should be excluded. Other than those who are removed because of problems in conduct (1 Cor. 5:11) or truth (2 John 7-11), no child of God should be excluded. All normal children of God need fellowship one with another. As we remember our Lord and touch Him, we touch all the people who belong to Him. The Lord loves us so much that He gave Himself for us. We cannot refrain from remembering Him, and we cannot refrain from loving those whom He loves. We cannot refrain from forgiving those whom He forgave, and we cannot refrain from remembering those whom He remembers. No other day is better than the first day of the week because this is the day which the Lord has made. This is the day of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. On this day it is a most spontaneous thing for us to remember all those who have become the new creation together with us.</p>
<p>Third, 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 says, &ldquo;Now concerning the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also do. On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered, that no collections be made when I come.&rdquo; Here we see the third thing to do on the first day of the week. Paul directed both the churches of Galatia and the church in Corinth to do the same thing. This clearly shows us that the first day of the week was a very special day during the apostles&rsquo; time. There was bread-breaking to remember the Lord, and there was the collection for the saints on the first day of the week. On the first day of every week, every one should offer to the Lord according to his income. This is a good practice. On the one hand, we have the bread-breaking, and on the other hand, there is the offering. On the one hand, we remember how the Lord gave Himself for us, and on the other hand, we also have to give to the Lord on this day. The more a person receives from the Lord, the more he should give. A thanksgiving offering in the form of material goods should be included in the thanksgiving and praise which we offer to Him (Heb. 13:16). This is well pleasing to God. Offering material goods to the Lord on His day is something that we should start practicing the moment we believe.</p>
<p>We should not drop our money mindlessly into the offering box. We should count, prepare, and wrap up our money in a godly way while we are still at home. Then when we come, we should put the money into the offering box. Paul shows us that material giving should be done consciously and regularly. On the first day of every week, we should lay aside according to our income and tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You have given to me richly. Lord, I bring to You what I have gained and offer it to You.&rdquo; You have to fix the amount that you will set aside. If you have much, you should offer more. If you have less, you can offer less. The breaking of bread is a serious matter, and the offering of material goods is also a serious matter.</p>
<p>The Lord has purposely set aside one day out of the week and has called it the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We hope that the brothers and sisters will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s grace abundantly and serve Him properly on this day. Our Lord&rsquo;s Day is different from the Sabbath in the Old Testament. The Sabbath emphasized what one should not do. The Jews were angry at the Lord Jesus when He healed the sick and cast out demons on the Sabbath. However, the Lord&rsquo;s Day is not for the rest of the body; neither is it the time for us to stop our work. The Lord&rsquo;s Day and the Sabbath are basically two different matters. The concept of working or not working on the Lord&rsquo;s Day does not exist for us. Whatever we do on other days, we can do on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Whatever we do not do on other days, we should not do on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. The Bible does not tell us whether we can walk, shop, do this, or do that on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It does not tell us whether we should keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day the same way men kept the Sabbath. But the Bible does tell us to exult and rejoice on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; it tells us to come to the Lord in singleness of heart to receive grace from Him, to remember Him, to serve Him, and to consecrate ourselves to Him. We have to mark out the Lord&rsquo;s Day as a special day in our life. At least the first day of the week is marked out for the Lord. This day is not our day; this day is the <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> day. This time is not ours; this time is the Lord&rsquo;s. Our business is for the Lord. Our rest is also for the Lord. Whether or not we do this or that, we are for the Lord. There is no flavor of the Sabbath here. This is the day that we consecrate to the Lord. This is the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>John put it well when he said, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; (Rev. 1:10). We hope many of us can say, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; We hope that this is the day that the church is in spirit and the day that we are blessed. We hope that new brothers and sisters will pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s Day from the very beginning. Consecrate the first day of the week to the Lord and say to Him, &ldquo;This is Your day.&rdquo; If we do this from our youth, we will be able to say after seventy years that we have given ten years fully to the Lord. This is a great blessing to the church. &ldquo;O Lord! I consecrate all my time on this day to You. I come to break the bread with gladness and joy in remembrance of You. I bring all that I have before You and I consecrate it all to You.&rdquo; If we do this, we will see God&rsquo;s blessing being showered abundantly upon the church.</p><h2 class="head1">APPENDIX&mdash;<br />
ANCIENT WRITINGS OF THE CHURCH<br />
CONCERNING THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY</h2>
<p>In <em>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</em> (one of the first books of the church in addition to the Bible, written between approximately A.D. 75 and A.D. 90, the same era as the book of Revelation), it says, &ldquo;But every Lord&rsquo;s day do ye gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving after having confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure&rdquo; (Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., <em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers.</em> Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1979. Vol. VII, p. 381). This clearly shows us that believers met together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day as early as the end of the first century.</p>
<p>The apostle John had a disciple called Ignatius who was born in A.D. 30 and martyred in A.D. 107. In A.D. 100 he wrote an epistle to the Magnesians. In chapter nine of this epistle, he stated clearly, &ldquo;If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things [referring to those in Judaism] have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death...&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. I, p. 62). This clearly shows us that the early church did not keep the Sabbath but kept the Lord&rsquo;s Day instead.</p>
<p>In about A.D. 120, Barnabas (not the Barnabas in the Bible) wrote an epistle. In chapter fifteen there was a phrase, &ldquo;Wherefore, also, we keep the eighth day with joyfulness, the day also on which Jesus rose again from the dead&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. I, p. 147).</p>
<p>Another well-known church father was Justin Martyr. He was born in A.D. 100 and was martyred in A.D. 165. In A.D. 138, he wrote a book called <em>The First Apology.</em> In that book he said, &ldquo;And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows, and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds, and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Savior on the same day rose from the dead. For He was crucified on the day before that of Saturn (Saturday); and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the day of the Sun, having appeared to His apostles and disciples, He taught them these things, which we have submitted to you also for your consideration&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. I, p. 186). In another place he wrote, &ldquo;We are circumcised from deceit and iniquity through Him who rose from the dead on the first day after the Sabbath, [namely through] our Lord Jesus Christ. For the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. I, p. 215).</p>
<p>In A.D. 170, there was a church father in the church in Sardis named Mileto. In his writings is this sentence, &ldquo;Today we have passed the Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection day. During this time, we read many epistles&rdquo; (source unknown).</p>
<p>There was a famous church father called Clement in the city of Alexandria in A.D. 194. He said, &ldquo;Today, the seventh day, has become a day of work, which is also a common working day.&rdquo; Following this, he said, &ldquo;We should keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. II, p. 545).</p>
<p>In A.D. 200, the church father Tertullian said, &ldquo;On the Lord&rsquo;s Day we are especially joyful. We keep this day which is the day of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. There is no hindrance and no worry.&rdquo; At that time, some had already criticized keeping the Lord&rsquo;s Day as a worshipping of the sun. So Tertullian replied saying, &ldquo;We rejoice on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We do not worship the sun. We are different from those who are lazy and feasting on Saturday&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. III, p. 123).</p>
<p>Origen was another famous person among the church fathers. He was a famous theologian in Alexandria. He said, &ldquo;To keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day is a mark of a complete Christian&rdquo; (<em>ibid.,</em> Vol. IV, p. 647).</p>
<p>Some have said that the ancient believers kept the Sabbath, and that Constantine changed it to the keeping of the first day of the week in the fourth century. This is not according to the facts. Constantine did not change this day at all. He only recognized this practice; the church had been keeping the Lord&rsquo;s Day for a long time already. Before A.D. 313 the Christians were persecuted. After A.D. 313 Constantine ruled over Rome and issued an edict in Milan to stop the persecution of Christians. In A.D. 321 Constantine issued a second edict in which he wrote, &ldquo;On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, officers and common people, those who live in the city, should rest and all work should be stopped&rdquo; (Philip Schaff and Henry Wace, eds., <em>The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.</em> Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1979. Vol. I, pp. 644-5). Constantine did not mention the Sabbath at all in this edict. He only recognized the first day of the week as the church&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>We see from the above sources that the keeping of the Lord&rsquo;s Day began from the time of the apostles and the church fathers. This has been the practice throughout the ages.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">HYMN SINGING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 104:33; Eph. 5:19; Matt. 26:30; Acts 16:25</h1>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to sing hymns. It is difficult when a Christian goes to a meeting but does not know how to sing hymns. Prayer is often neglected in the meeting, but hymn singing is neglected even more. We must learn to sing hymns. We are not trying to be musicians, but we should be familiar with the hymns. This is an important matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE FEELINGS BEHIND THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>There are prophecies, histories, doctrines, teachings, and commandments in the Bible. There are also songs in the Bible. Songs are the expression of man&rsquo;s finest feelings. The sentiments of man&rsquo;s prayer before God cannot match the sentiments of his songs before God; the former are never as fine and tender as the latter. God wants us to have fine and tender feelings. This is why He gives us many kinds of songs in the Bible. In addition to the Psalms, the Song of Songs, and Lamentations, there are also songs in the history and the commandments (Exo. 15:1-18; Deut. 32:1-43). Even in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we find hymns interspersed in his teachings (Rom. 11:33-36; 1 Tim. 3:16; etc.). All these examples show us that God wants His people to have fine and tender feelings.</p>
<p>Our Lord&rsquo;s feelings are fine and tender. We have fine feelings as well as harsh feelings. Wrath and anger are clearly harsh feelings. Some people are not full of wrath, but their feelings are not fine either. God wants us to be patient, compassionate, merciful, and sympathetic because all these are fine feelings. God wants us to sing in the midst of our trials and to praise and bless His name in the midst of our pain because all these are expressions of fine feelings. When a person loves another person, his feeling is tender. When he forgives or shows mercy to others, his feeling is also tender.</p>
<p>God wants to lead His children toward a walk of finer, tenderer, and more song-like feelings. The more a person learns of God, the finer, tenderer, and more song-like his feelings become. Those who learn little before God are rough and unrefined in their feelings. If a Christian walks noisily into the meeting and has no concern for others, he is not behaving like a well-tempered Christian. Even when he sings, his voice will not sound like a song. If a person walks into a meeting and runs over others left and right, knocking over chairs, he is not behaving like a person of song. We must realize that from the day we were saved, God has been training us to have fine and tender feelings day by day. To be a good Christian, one must have fine and tender feelings. The deepest feelings that flow from a man&rsquo;s heart are the feelings expressed in songs. We do not want harsh feelings. Harsh feelings have nothing to do with hymns; they do not belong to a Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HYMNS</h2>
<p>Every hymn that is up to the standard must meet three basic requirements. If a hymn fails to meet any of these requirements, it is not a good hymn.</p>
<p>First, the words of a hymn must be based on the truth. Many hymns meet the other two requirements but contain errors in truth. If we ask God&rsquo;s children to sing these hymns, we are leading them into error. We are putting human errors into their hand when they go before the Lord; we are ushering them into an improper sentiment. When God&rsquo;s children sing hymns, their feelings are directed toward God. If the hymns have wrong doctrines, they will be cheated in their feelings and will not touch reality. God does not meet us according to the poetic sentiment of the hymn; He meets us according to the truth conveyed in the hymn. We can only come before God in truth. If we do not come to God in truth, we are in error and will not touch reality.</p>
<p>For example, one gospel hymn says that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; blood cleanses our heart. But the New Testament does not speak of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; blood cleansing our heart. The Lord&rsquo;s blood does not cleanse our heart; there is no such word in the Bible. Hebrews 9:14 says that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; blood purifies our conscience&mdash;the conscience is part of the heart, not the heart itself. The Lord&rsquo;s blood washes us from our sins. Because we have been washed from our sins, our conscience no longer accuses us before God. Therefore, the blood cleanses only the conscience, not the heart. Our heart cannot be cleansed by the blood. Man&rsquo;s heart is deceitful above all things (Jer. 17:9). No matter how much we try to wash it, it can never be cleansed. The biblical teaching concerning the heart is that our stony heart is removed and that God gives to us a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26). He gives us a new heart; He does not cleanse the old heart. When a man believes in the Lord, God gives him a new heart. He does not cleanse his old heart but washes away the offenses in his conscience. God does not wash his heart. If we go to the Lord and praise Him, saying, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus cleanses my heart,&rdquo; our praise is not according to the truth. This is a very serious matter. If there are errors in the doctrine of a hymn, it will bring people into wrong sentiments.</p>
<p>Many hymns make no distinction in the dispensations. We do not know whether such a hymn should be sung by Abraham or by Moses. We do not know whether it should be sung by the Jews or by the Christians. We do not know whether it belongs to the Old Testament or the New Testament. When you sing this kind of hymn, it makes you feel as if you are an angel who has nothing to do with redemption, that you have no sin and no need of the blood. If a hymn is not clear in its teachings concerning the dispensations, and if it does not reflect the age of grace, it will lead God&rsquo;s children into error.</p>
<p>Many hymns express only hope but no assurance. They express a hope to be saved, a desire to be saved, and a pursuit of salvation, but there is no Christian assurance whatsoever. We must remember that every Christian should come to God with full assurance. We come to God with full assurance of faith. If a hymn gives a man the feeling that he is in the outer court, his singing will make him think that he is not one of God&rsquo;s people and that he is merely aspiring to be one of His people. Many hymns give people the impression that God&rsquo;s grace is still far off and that a man still needs to seek for it. Such hymns put a Christian in the wrong position. This is not the Christian position. The Christian position is one full of assurance, one that gives him the confidence that he is saved. All hymns which do not give a Christian such assurance should not be sung.</p>
<p>Another common error found in many hymns is the notion that man enters into glory after he dies. Many hymns speak of the entrance into glory at the time of death, as if a man enters glory through death. But the Bible does not say that a man enters glory after he dies. Entrance into glory is something different from death. After we die, we do not enter into glory. After we die, we wait for resurrection. The Lord entered into glory only after He resurrected. This is the clear teaching of the Bible (1 Cor. 15:43; 2 Cor. 5:2-3). Any hymn that gives God&rsquo;s children a wrong impression that man enters glory when he dies should not be sung at all, because there is no such thing. Therefore, a good hymn must be accurate in its doctrines. If it falls short in doctrinal integrity, it will easily lead Christians into error.</p>
<p>Second, accurate doctrines alone do not constitute a hymn. A hymn needs to be poetic in its form and structure. Truth alone is not sufficient. After there is the truth, there is still the need for poetry in form and structure. Only when there is poetry is a hymn like a hymn. Singing is not preaching. We cannot sing a message. There was one hymn which began with the words: &ldquo;The true God created the heavens, the earth, and man.&rdquo; This may be something good for preaching, but this is not singing. This is a doctrine, not a hymn. All the songs in the book of Psalms are poetry. Every psalm is fine and tender in form and expression and utters God&rsquo;s mind in the way of poetry. Merely having every line follow a certain meter does not constitute a hymn. The structure must be poetic, and the form must be poetic.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to the truth and poetic structure and form, a hymn needs to provide spiritual impact. It must touch spiritual reality.</p>
<p>For example, Psalm 51 is a psalm of repentance by David. In reading it, we find David&rsquo;s repentance doctrinally correct, his words carefully chosen, and the structure of the psalm intricate. But more than that, we feel something within the words; there is a spiritual reality, a spiritual feeling, within the psalm. We can call this the <em>burden</em> of the hymn. David repented, and the feeling of his repentance permeates the whole psalm. Many times in reading the book of Psalms, there is something we are struck with&mdash;every sentiment expressed in these psalms is genuine. When the psalmist rejoiced, he jumped up and shouted for joy. When he was sad, he wept. These psalms are not empty words void of reality. There is spiritual reality behind the words.</p>
<p>Therefore, a hymn must be not only accurate in truth and poetic in form and structure, but also filled with the sense of spiritual reality. In other words, if a hymn is meant for tears, it should make you cry. If it is meant for joy, it should make you happy. When it speaks of a certain thing, it should make you feel that very thing. We cannot sing a hymn on repentance without having a corresponding echo in our heart; we cannot be laughing while we are singing it. We cannot say that we are singing praises to God, yet be void of joy and rejoicing. We cannot sing a hymn on consecration, yet have no feeling of consecration. We cannot say that a hymn calls for prostration and brokenness before God, yet remain comfortable and proud of ourselves. If a hymn cannot give us an accurate feeling on a subject, it is not a good hymn. The feeling of a hymn must be genuine, and it must touch spiritual reality.</p>
<p>A hymn must be accurate in truth and poetic in form. At the same time, it must invoke the singer to the spiritual reality behind the words, that is, to touch what the hymn says. Otherwise, it is not up to the standard. All three requirements must be met before a hymn can be considered a good hymn.</p><h2 class="head1">III. EXAMPLES OF HYMNS</h2>
<p>Now let us look at a few hymns to illustrate our point:</p>
<h2 class="head2">Example 1: <em>Hymns,</em> #127</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Hark! ten thousand voices crying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lamb of God!&rdquo; with one accord;<br />
Thousand thousand saints replying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake at once the echo&rsquo;ng chord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Praise the Lamb!&rdquo; the chorus waking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in heav&rsquo;n together throng;<br />
Loud and far each tongue partaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolls around the endless song.</li>
<li>Grateful incense this, ascending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever to the Father&rsquo;s throne;<br />
Every knee to Jesus bending,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the mind in heav&rsquo;n is one.</li>
<li>All the Father&rsquo;s counsels claiming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal honors to the Son,<br />
All the Son&rsquo;s effulgence beaming,<br />

<li>Joyful now the new creation<br />

<li>Hark! the heavenly notes again!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudly swells the song of praise;<br />
Through creation&rsquo;s vault, Amen!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen! responsive joy doth raise.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is rare for us to come across a hymn as great as this one. This hymn was written by J. N. Darby. Originally there were thirteen stanzas. In 1881, when he worked on this hymn with Mr. Wigram, he deleted several stanzas. Now there are only seven stanzas.</p>
<p>Apparently this hymn is speaking to man. Actually it is directed toward God. In singing it, we feel as if we are being lifted up to the universal stage in Revelation 4 and 5, the scene after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension. Here we find Golgotha, resurrection, and ascension. The heaven is filled with glory, and at the name of Jesus, ten thousand voices begin their praise, and ten thousand knees bow to worship. In the heavens, on earth, and under the earth, praises ring from all directions. The whole universe is singing praises to Him. Such grandeur and majesty are unmatched by any other song! A person with lesser capacity would not have been able to write such a hymn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! ten thousand voices crying.&rdquo; These ten thousand voices came out of nowhere! It is as if a trifling believer, a little worm, a small man, is shouting at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Hark! ten thousand voices are crying, &lsquo;Lamb of God!&rsquo; with one accord. Listen, thousands and thousands of saints are replying.&rdquo; Once the Lamb of God is lifted up, there is the universal response. On the one side is the sound of praise, and on the other side is the sound of response. Ten thousand voices shout, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing&rdquo; (Rev. 5:12). Even before this sound dies out, thousands and thousands of voices join in. &ldquo;And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them&rdquo; (Rev. 5:13) respond together. What is the result? &ldquo;Wake at once the echo&rsquo;ng chord.&rdquo; This sound blasts forth in unparalleled magnificence. Anyone who touches this stanza will immediately be struck by his own smallness. The very first stanza raptures him to a grand and majestic scene where ten thousand voices are crying and thousands and thousands of saints are echoing. The sound rolls majestically and endlessly to an exaltation of the Lamb of God in one accord. The very opening gives a sense of awe, of the greatness of the universal praise.</p>
<p>Every subsequent stanza closely follows the preceding one. &ldquo;Praise the Lamb! the chorus waking.&rdquo; We hear the cry, &ldquo;Praise the Lamb,&rdquo; from all directions. All of them resound, &ldquo;Praise the Lamb!&rdquo; It is &ldquo;praise the Lamb&rdquo; here and &ldquo;praise the Lamb&rdquo; there and everywhere. These voices come from all directions. &ldquo;All in heav&rsquo;n together throng.&rdquo; <em>All in heaven</em> means the whole heaven. All things there throng together to sing praises. &ldquo;Loud and far each tongue partaking&rdquo;&mdash;every mouth is confessing. Spontaneously this brings out Philippians 2:11: &ldquo;And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.&rdquo; Every mouth is confessing; this is why it is &ldquo;loud and far.&rdquo; Such endless song rolls around the whole universe. The whole universe is overflowing with this &ldquo;endless song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are not only voices but also &ldquo;grateful incense...ascending.&rdquo; This grateful incense is ascending &ldquo;ever to the Father&rsquo;s throne.&rdquo; Not only are mouths crying, but also grateful hearts are ever ascending toward God. Not only are we crying to the Lamb with our mouths, but also our hearts are ascending to God. It is as if God&rsquo;s plan and the Lord&rsquo;s redemption have become one inseparable entity. We praise the Lamb, and we also thank God the Father. Such gratitude in praise and thanksgiving ascends to God like incense.</p>
<p>This praise does not stop here. The mouths are crying and shouting, but this is not all, because every knee has to bow and worship. Every knee must bow and worship the Lord. First there is &ldquo;each tongue,&rdquo; and then there is &ldquo;every knee.&rdquo; Spontaneously every knee bends to Jesus. On the one hand, we have thanksgiving to the Father. On the other hand, we have prostrating before the Lord. The next line is very poetic: &ldquo;All the mind in heav&rsquo;n is one.&rdquo; This is not preaching. Those with less sensitive feelings cannot touch anything here. But when a person is brought to the stage where he sees the object of every tongue&rsquo;s praise and every knee&rsquo;s worship, spontaneously he will proclaim, &ldquo;How one is all the mind in heaven!&rdquo; The words <em>all...is one</em> are very poetic.</p>
<p>Once the writer of the hymn touches the Father and the Son, he brings out the doctrine of the Son and the doctrine of the Father. Everything is now revealed. &ldquo;All the Son&rsquo;s effulgence beaming, / Makes the Father&rsquo;s glory known.&rdquo; Glory is inward while effulgence is outward. What the Father has is glory. This glory of the Father becomes the effulgence in the Son. The Son&rsquo;s effulgence is the expression of the Father&rsquo;s glory. With the Father there is the glory; with the Son there is the expression of this glory. The expression is not with the Father but with the Son. &ldquo;All the Father&rsquo;s counsels.&rdquo; Counsel is inward, and these counsels are &ldquo;claiming equal honors to the Son.&rdquo; This is not the Father&rsquo;s act, but the Father&rsquo;s counsels; it is not the Father&rsquo;s work, but the Father&rsquo;s plan. He wants to reveal to man that the Son is of equal honor. The third stanza turns from the Father to the Son. The fourth stanza turns from the Son to the Father and then from the Father back to the Son; it begins with the Son and ends with the Son. In the third stanza the writer begins to touch the Son, and in the fourth stanza the Son is touched again. Here we see the doctrine concerning the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>Anyone who touches the Father and the Son cannot stop with the Father and the Son only. And so it continues, &ldquo;By the Spirit all pervading...&rdquo; The Spirit comes into play. Once the Spirit appears, the scene is turned from the Son and the Father. The Spirit is all-pervading, all-permeating, and all-inclusive. The universe is filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hosts unnumbered...hail Him.&rdquo; <em>Hosts</em> here is a poetic expression. The heavenly angels, heavenly creatures, and unnumbered heavenly beings all hail Him. &ldquo;Hail Him as the great &lsquo;I AM.&rsquo;&rdquo; The great &lsquo;I AM&rsquo; is Jehovah (cf. Exo. 3:14; 6:2). This is truly a hymn of praise, a grand hymn of praise!</p>
<p>Now we have to turn to the things around us: &ldquo;Joyful now the new creation / Rests in undisturbed repose.&rdquo; The surrounding scene is full of joy, rest, peace, and repose. Everyone is joyful, restful, undisturbed, and in repose. This is because everyone is &ldquo;blest in Jesus&rsquo; full salvation&rdquo; and &ldquo;sorrow now nor thraldom knows.&rdquo; All the problems have passed away.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, we might have tarried for too long, and so &ldquo;Hark! the heavenly notes again!&rdquo; Can you hear it? &ldquo;Loudly swells the song of praise.&rdquo; The sound of praise resounds from all directions again. There is still more to hear: &ldquo;Through creation&rsquo;s vault, Amen!&rdquo; The whole universe is full of praises and amens. Every corner is crying, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Why? &ldquo;Amen! responsive joy doth raise.&rdquo; The last amen is most poetic. It is not the amen one says after a song, but an amen that is raised in &ldquo;responsive joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn shows us a redeemed universe, the scene depicted in Revelation 4 and 5, and Philippians 2. This is the praise in eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">Example 2: <em>Hymns,</em> #578</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>My will is weak, my strength is frail,<br />
And all my hope is nearly gone;<br />
I can but trust Thy working true<br />
To gently hold and lead me on.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve tried my best, but still have failed,<br />
E&rsquo;en as before I&rsquo;ve failed and erred;<br />
Thy patience is my only trust<br />
To hold and keep me to Thy word.</li>
<li>Whene&rsquo;er my heart is lifted up,<br />
How very near I am to fall;<br />
I dare not do, I dare not think,<br />
I need Thyself in great or small.</li>
<li>Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,<br />
O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;<br />
Though I&rsquo;m the weakest of the weak,<br />
My strength is nothing but Thy grace.<br />
This is a good hymn directed toward God.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;My will is weak, my strength is frail.&rdquo; Inwardly the will is weak, while outwardly the strength is frail. Inwardly one wants to will, but he is too weak. Outwardly he wants to do something, but he is too frail. He can neither will nor run. Thus &ldquo;all my hope is nearly gone.&rdquo; What else can he do? He can only &ldquo;trust Thy working true.&rdquo; At first the writer was talking to himself, but now he turns to God. He comes to God and looks to Him &ldquo;to gently hold and lead me on.&rdquo; This means that other than the Lord&rsquo;s gentle step-by-step leading, he now has no more hope. This is where he stands.</p>
<p>Following this, we have the next line: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried my best, but still have failed.&rdquo; This is not preaching; this is poetry. &ldquo;E&rsquo;en as before I&rsquo;ve failed and erred.&rdquo; What should he do? &ldquo;Thy patience is my only trust.&rdquo; He trusts in the Lord&rsquo;s patience to do what? &ldquo;To hold and keep me to Thy word.&rdquo; He has no other hope. His only hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s power. It is His power that holds and keeps him in obedience. He sees himself as being completely hopeless; he is clear about himself.</p>
<p>In the third stanza, we see a man of God climbing slowly upward. &ldquo;Whene&rsquo;er my heart is lifted up&rdquo;&mdash;this means whenever he is slightly proud and self-appreciating (only very slightly)&mdash;&ldquo;How very near I am to fall.&rdquo; He has had too much of such experiences already. What should he do now? &ldquo;I dare not do, I dare not think.&rdquo; He dares not do anything; he even dares not think anything. &ldquo;I need Thyself in great or small&rdquo;&mdash;this means that he needs the Lord in everything and in every place. Here is a person whose sentiments have thoroughly passed through the refining fire. They are not harsh before God. Every word is poetry and full of feeling. Every word touches God and God alone.</p>
<p>However, a person who knows himself does not remain in himself. Eventually, he has to pray to God, &ldquo;Thou art my Savior, strength and stay, / O Lord, I come to seek Thy face.&rdquo; I have no way, no hope, nothing. I can only come to seek after You. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m the weakest of the weak&rdquo;&mdash;here he refers back to stanza one. He does not end abruptly. My will is weak. My strength is frail. I cannot will. I cannot run. I am the weakest of the weak. What shall I do? &ldquo;My strength is nothing but Thy grace.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s grace is all that he needs. It is this grace that enables him to go on.</p>
<p>If our feelings are tested and refined, every time we come to God and touch such a divinely tested and refined hymn, our feeling cannot help but be caught up in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Example 3: <em>Hymns,</em> #377</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>If the path I travel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead me to the cross,<br />
If the way Thou choosest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead to pain and loss,<br />
Let the compensation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, hourly, be<br />
Shadowless communion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed Lord, with Thee.</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s less of earth joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give, Lord, more of heaven.<br />
Let the spirit praise Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the heart be riven;<br />
If sweet earthly ties, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break at Thy decree,<br />
Let the tie that binds us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer, sweeter, be.</li>
<li>Lonely though the pathway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheer it with Thy smile;<br />
Be Thou my companion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through earth&rsquo;s little while;<br />
Selfless may I live, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Thy grace to be<br />
Just a cleans&#232;d channel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Thy life through me.</li>
</ol>
<p>This also is a very good hymn. The expressions and wording are very poetic, and the feeling is very deep. Everything about it belongs to a higher realm and is lofty and mature. It is rare for a hymn on fellowship to reach such a standard. There is not a tint of unnaturalness or extreme. It is a genuine expression of a genuine lover of the Lord toward Him. It is perfect submission borne out of perfect consecration. It is the voice of submission that comes from the heart of one who has no resistance toward the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the path I travel / Lead me to the cross, / If the way Thou choosest / Lead to pain and loss, / Let the compensation / Daily, hourly, be / Shadowless communion, / Blessed Lord, with Thee.&rdquo; This is full of consecration and submission.</p>
<p>Stanza two is the best stanza in the whole hymn. Here the feeling ascends still higher. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s less of earth joy&rdquo;&mdash;the writer is contemplating&mdash;&ldquo;Give, Lord, more of heaven.&rdquo; He is praying to God, not for deliverance or for change, but for more fellowship. &ldquo;Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riven.&rdquo; Here is a person who can differentiate between the heart and the spirit. The heart may be broken, but the spirit can praise. The heart may be riven, but the spirit is still fresh before God. He knows the difference between the heart and the spirit. He does not ask for enjoyment of the heart but for compensation of the spirit. He has begun the ascent, but the next line is still higher. The first line says, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s less of earth joy,&rdquo; while the fifth line says, &ldquo;If sweet earthly ties, Lord, / Break...&rdquo; These two lines are linked by the word <em>earth.</em> This is poetry. &ldquo;If sweet earthly ties, Lord, / Break at Thy decree, / Let the tie that binds us, / Closer, sweeter, be.&rdquo; He seeks neither compromise nor escape. He asks only for better fellowship. He jumps from the &ldquo;sweet earthly ties&rdquo; in the fifth line to &ldquo;the tie that binds us.&rdquo; This is lovely. The feeling is fine, the words are right, and the structure is wonderful. This is beautiful!</p>
<p>Since stanza two reaches the climax, stanza three turns into a prayer: &ldquo;Lonely though the pathway, / Cheer it with Thy smile.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cheer it with Thy smile&rdquo;&mdash;this is so spiritual and poetic. &ldquo;Selfless may I live, Lord, / By Thy grace to be / Just a cleans&#232;d channel / For Thy life through me.&rdquo; This means that he asks for nothing else except that he would be a selfless and holy vessel to carry out God&rsquo;s will. This is the prayerful finale of a consecrated person in suffering. If we read this hymn carefully, we will see that this is truly a fine hymn. We have to come to God to learn these hymns and the spirit of these hymns.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. CLASSIFICATION OF HYMNS</h2>
<p>We can classify the hymns into four categories: (1) the gospel trumpet; (2) words of praise; (3) Christ as life; and (4) the church life.</p>
<p>The first category is the gospel trumpet. This is to be used in the preaching of the gospel. It includes songs on the guilt of sin, the sinner&rsquo;s position, God&rsquo;s love, His righteousness, the redemption of the cross, repentance, faith in God, and so on.</p>
<p>The gospel hymns are to be sung by the gospel friends and us together. But there is a problem here. The hymns are written by saved persons. We have certain sentiments, but the gospel friends do not have these sentiments. It is not easy to ask them to sing songs which do not touch their feelings. However, if God blesses these hymns, the hidden needs of the sinners will be touched, and they will see their own condition as well as God&rsquo;s salvation. Sometimes a sinner does not know how to pray or come to God, but the hymns help him come to God and pray. A hymn&rsquo;s utterance becomes his utterance. Sometimes a hymn may be more effective than a message. At any rate, we need God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The gospel hymns are included in the hymn book for God&rsquo;s children to use. In preaching the gospel, we should write out the hymns on big banners or print them on sheets. In this way we can invite our gospel friends to sing along with us. It is not easy for them to look for a hymn from the hymn book.</p>
<p>The second category is words of praise. The very day we were saved, we received heavenly joy, and thanksgiving and praises swelled from within us toward heaven. As we advance more in our spiritual walk, and as our knowledge of God&rsquo;s love, righteousness, grace, and glory grows, our hearts and mouths flow out in unceasing praises. This category of hymns includes all our praises toward the Lord and God.</p>
<p>The third category of hymns concerns Christ as life. The goal of God&rsquo;s redemption is that we would live the life of Christ. God does not ask us to imitate Christ. God wants the resurrected Christ to be lived out from us. When Christ was on earth, He was expressed through the body He received from Mary. Since His resurrection and ascension, His body is the church, and now He wants to be expressed through the church.</p>
<p>When we were sinners, we needed salvation and justification. After becoming believers, our pursuit turns to the knowledge and experience of the life of Christ; we seek to live out the life of this Christ. &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). He lived on earth on our behalf. He dealt with our sins, our temptations, and our flesh. Now He becomes our life, our holiness, our love, and our joy. He is doing the work, not we. This is the goal of the work of the Holy Spirit in this age. This category of hymns includes everything from our initial pursuit of the knowledge of the inner life to the full expression of this life in faith, fellowship, satisfaction, warfare, and service. In short, it includes everything related to the pursuit and experience of this life.</p>
<p>The fourth category of hymns concerns the church life. It includes everything related to our Christian walk, the everyday experience, environment, work, and affairs of a Christian. This category includes hymns for meetings, marriage, love feasts, family, children, sickness, etc.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. HOW TO USE THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>In choosing the hymns, we must note the following:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Direction of a Hymn</h2>
<p>Hymns are sung to three different kinds of people. In other words, they are directed toward three parties.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Toward God</h2>
<p>Most hymns are directed toward God. The object of this poetry is God. Most of the psalms in the book of Psalms are poetry directed toward God. Psalm 51 is a famous psalm of prayer to God. All hymns of praise, thanksgiving, and prayer are sung to God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Toward Men</h2>
<p>Other psalms are directed toward men. Psalms 37 and 133 are examples of such psalms. This kind of hymn either preaches to men or encourages men to go to God. All the gospel hymns and hymns of admonition are sung to men.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; Here we see that psalms and hymns can be used for teaching and admonishing. This is toward men. But at the same time, it involves &ldquo;singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; This is also toward God. Therefore, even hymns that are toward men are directed toward God.</p>
<p>In the church there should not be too many hymns directed toward men. In the book of Psalms, this kind of song occupies a small portion. We can have hymns that are directed toward men, but it is not proper to have too many such hymns. When there are too many of this kind of hymn, we lose sight of the main purpose of the hymns. The main goal of the hymns is to direct men toward God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Toward Oneself</h2>
<p>There is still a third kind of hymn in the Bible&mdash;those which we sing to ourselves. Many passages in the book of Psalms include the phrase <em>O my soul!</em> All these hymns are directed toward oneself. Psalms 103 and 121 are good examples of such hymns. This kind of hymn is a person&rsquo;s fellowship with his own soul. It is one&rsquo;s counsel with his own heart and his conversation with himself. Everyone who knows God knows the meaning of fellowshipping with his own heart. When a person has fellowship with God, he spontaneously learns how to fellowship with his own heart. At such times, one sings to himself, shouts to himself, addresses himself, and reminds himself. Such hymns often end with a turn to God. A man may begin by fellowshipping with his own heart, but invariably he ends up fellowshipping with God.</p>
<p>Each of these three kinds of hymns can be used in its own way. Hymns on salvation, fellowship, thanksgiving, and praise are sung toward God. When the church gathers together, we should choose hymns which are directed toward God; our hearts must be directed toward God. When we engage ourselves in work, or when we address the saints or sinners, the hymns function as part of the preaching, and we sing toward men. When we are alone, we can sing hymns in fellowship with ourselves. In the church meetings (the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, and the fellowship meeting), we need to learn to sing to God; sometimes we can sing to ourselves. In the meetings of the work (gospel meetings and message meetings), we can use hymns that are directed toward men as well as hymns that are for God. When we are by ourselves or when there are individual needs, we can use the hymns that are meant for ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Different Ways to Sing the Hymns</h2>
<p>As far as we know, there are three ways to sing in the Bible: congregational singing, mutual singing, and solo singing.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament we find several instances when the Levites sang alone. The rest of the time the whole congregation sang. The book of Psalms is for congregational singing. When we come to the New Testament, we find hymn singing also being practiced in public. On the last night the Lord and the disciples were together, Matthew 26:30 says, &ldquo;After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.&rdquo; This shows that they sang the hymn together. Therefore, congregational singing is found both in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament.</p>
<p>After the church came into being, mutual singing and solo singing were added to congregational singing. Both Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:19 speak of the matter of mutual singing. In mutual singing, after one brother sings, another brother responds by singing. The first brother may sing again, and the other brother responds again. Or several brothers can sing and another group of brothers respond in singing. The first group of brothers sings again, and the other group responds again. This way of mutual singing was almost as common in the early churches as congregational singing. It was a singing by brothers to brothers. However, when the clergy-laity system was formed in the church, mutual singing turned into a kind of singing between the clergy and the laity, the so-called antiphon. Later, it became the so-called responsive reading.</p>
<p>We believe that the Lord is still recovering the matter of singing among us. There is such a thing as singing one to another in the Bible. Hence, we should sing one to another. We may sing alternately stanza by stanza, between the sisters and the brothers, between one person and the whole congregation, or between different groups. The ones who sit in front can sing alternately to those sitting at the back, or those sitting on the left can sing alternately to those sitting on the right. All these are good ways to sing.</p>
<p>There is also solo singing in the Bible. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; The phrase <em>each one has a psalm</em> refers to solo singing. In the meeting one brother may receive a revelation. Another brother may receive a teaching, and still a third brother may receive a psalm. The psalm here is sung by the individual. A brother feels that he has a psalm or a praise; he is filled inwardly, and he wants to sing it out loud. He is not doing something alone, something that others do not want to do. He is singing on behalf of the whole church. This kind of solo singing may or may not be based on something written. It may or may not follow a familiar tune. Many times, we can sing &ldquo;spiritual songs,&rdquo; the kind spoken of in the Bible (Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15). While one is singing such songs, the Holy Spirit spontaneously supplies the music and the tune. The person is inspired by the Holy Spirit to sing. In this kind of solo singing, the singer should put his whole being into the hymn, and the audience should learn to receive the supply from his spirit. The audience must not pay too much attention to the tune; they should try their best to receive the supply from the spirit. This kind of solo singing, whether with an existing melody or with an extemporaneous tune, needs to be done under the special inspiration of the Holy Spirit; it is unlike the solos of those who love to exhibit their flesh. Those who do not have the supply of the spirit should not sing any solos.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Practical Training</h2>
<p>We must first familiarize ourselves with the table of contents of the hymnal. We must remember clearly how the hymns are classified. If you understand the principle of classification, memorize the nature and use of every category, and know the location of each hymn, you readily will find the desired hymn when you have a need.</p>
<p>Find a hymn which is most applicable to you and learn it. Understand the words and the punctuation, and find how the writer&rsquo;s thoughts unfold from beginning to end. Your heart has to be open. You have to have sensitive feelings, a pliable will, and a clear mind.</p>
<p>After all this, you still need to learn to sing. You can learn two to three hymns a week. At the beginning, if you cannot sing, you can hum a few tunes every morning, or you can make up simple tunes to hum to the hymn. Through this you will touch the spirit of the hymn and increase your spiritual senses. However, you still have to learn to sing according to the proper notes. After you have learned the proper notes, you can sing in whatever way the Spirit leads, whether it be congregational singing, mutual singing, or solo singing.</p>
<p>Hymns cultivate fine and tender spiritual feelings in a Christian. I hope that we can all learn something before God. If we can come to God in a fine and tender way, we will develop a more intimate fellowship with God. Thank the Lord that in eternity all our feelings will be fine and tender. We know that the praises in the heavens are more than the prayers on earth. Prayers will go away, but praises will fill the universe in eternity. On that day all of our feelings will be fine and tender. That will be the sweetest and happiest day.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">PRAISING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 22:3; 50:23; 106:12, 47; 146:2; Heb. 13:15</h1>
<p>Praise is the highest work carried out by God&rsquo;s children. We can say that the highest expression of a saint&rsquo;s spiritual life is his praise to God. God&rsquo;s throne is the highest point in the universe, yet He sits &ldquo;enthroned upon the praises of Israel&rdquo; (Psa. 22:3). God&rsquo;s name and even God Himself are exalted through praise.</p>
<p>David said in a psalm that he prayed to God three times a day (Psa. 55:17). Yet in another psalm, he said that he praised God <em>seven</em> times a day (119:164). David was inspired by the Holy Spirit when he acknowledged the importance of praising. He prayed only three times a day, but he praised seven times a day. Furthermore, he appointed Levites to play psalteries and harps to exalt, thank, and praise God before the ark of His covenant (1 Chron. 16:4-6). When Solomon completed the building of Jehovah&rsquo;s temple, the priests carried the ark of the covenant into the Holy of Holies. When the priests came out of the Holy Place, the Levites stood beside the altar, sounded the trumpets, and sang with cymbals, psalteries, and harps. Together they sounded praises to God. At that moment, the glory of Jehovah filled His house (2 Chron. 5:12-14). Both David and Solomon touched God&rsquo;s heart and offered up sacrifices of praise that were pleasing to God. Jehovah is enthroned upon the praises of Israel. We should praise the Lord all our life. We should sing praises to our God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SACRIFICE OF PRAISE</h2>
<p>The Bible pays much attention to praise. It is spoken of frequently in the Scriptures. The book of Psalms is full of praises. The book of Psalms is in fact a book of praise in the Old Testament. Many praises are quoted from Psalms.</p>
<p>However, the Psalms contain chapters not only of praises but also of suffering. God wants His people to know that the praising ones are the very ones who have been led through trying situations and whose feelings have been wounded. These psalms show us men led by God through shadows of darkness. They were rejected, slandered, and persecuted. &ldquo;All Your waves and Your billows / Pass over me&rdquo; (42:7). Yet God perfected praises out of these ones. Words of praise do not always come from the mouths of the smooth-sailing ones. They come much more from those who are under discipline and trial. In the Psalms we can touch the most wounded feelings, and in the Psalms we also can find the greatest and highest praises. God uses many hardships, difficulties, and slanders to create praises in His people. He causes them to learn through difficult circumstances to become praising persons before the Lord.</p>
<p>The happiest persons are not always the ones who have the loudest praise. The loudest praise comes very often from the ones who are passing through hardships. This kind of praise is most pleasing to God and is blessed by Him. God does not want men to praise Him only when they are on the mountaintop surveying Canaan, the promised land. God desires much more to see His people writing psalms and praising Him when they &ldquo;walk through the valley of the shadow of death&rdquo; (23:4). This is genuine praise.</p>
<p>This shows us the nature of praise in the eyes of God. The nature of praise is an offering, a sacrifice. In other words, praise comes from pain and suffering. Hebrews 13:15 says, &ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.&rdquo; What is a sacrifice? A sacrifice is an offering. An offering means death and loss. The person who offers an offering must suffer some loss. An offering, a sacrifice, must be offered up. This offering up constitutes a loss. The bull and the lamb are yours. When you offer them up, you are sacrificing them. To offer up something does not mean to gain anything; it means to suffer a loss. When a person offers up his praise, he is losing something; he is offering a sacrifice to God. In other words, God inflicts wounds; He breaks and cuts a person deeply, yet at the same time, such a person turns to Him and praises Him. Suffering for the sake of offering God praise is a kind of offering. God likes men to praise Him in this way. God likes to be enthroned upon this kind of praise. How can God receive His praise? God wants His children to praise Him in the midst of their sufferings. We should not praise only when there is gain. Although praise offered as a result of gain is praise, it cannot be considered an offering. The principle of offering is based on loss. An offering carries with it the element of loss. God wants us to praise Him in the midst of our loss. This makes a real offering.</p>
<p>We should not only pray to God but also learn all the more to praise God. We need to see the significance of praise at the very beginning of our Christian walk. We must praise God unceasingly. David received grace from God to praise seven times a day. It is a good exercise, a very good lesson, and a very good spiritual practice to praise God every day. We should learn to praise God when we get up early in the morning. We should learn to praise Him when we encounter problems, when we are at a meeting, or when we are alone. We should praise God at least seven times a day. Do not let David beat us in his praise. If we have not learned to praise God every day, it is hard to have the kind of sacrifice of praise spoken of in Hebrews 13.</p>
<p>As you learn to praise, you will find that there are days in which you cannot gather yourself to praise. Perhaps you praised God seven times today, yesterday, and the day before. Perhaps you praised Him a week or a month ago. But one day you will find that you cannot utter a praise. On such days you are in pain, total darkness, or dire trouble. On such days you suffer misunderstanding and slander. You are busy shedding tears of self-pity. How can you praise God on such days? You cannot praise because you are wounded, suffering pain, and in difficulty. You feel that the most obvious response would be complaint rather than praise. You feel that the most obvious thing to do would be to murmur rather than give thanks. You do not feel like praising, and you have no intention to praise. You feel that praise is not suitable under this kind of circumstance and mood. At that very moment, you should remember that Jehovah&rsquo;s throne has not changed, His name has not changed, and His glory has not changed. You should praise Him simply because He is worthy of praise. You should bless Him simply because He is worthy of all blessings. Although you are in the midst of difficulties, He is still worthy to be praised. Although you are in distress, you still have to praise Him. At that moment, your praise becomes a sacrifice of praise. Your praise is like the slaughter of your fattest calf. It is like putting your dear Isaac on the altar. Your praise in tears is a sacrifice of praise. What is an offering? An offering implies wounds, death, loss, and sacrifice. You are wounded before God. You die before God. You suffer loss, and you sacrifice before God. But you realize that God&rsquo;s throne is established in the heavens and cannot be shaken, and you do not hold back your praise. This is the sacrifice of praise. God desires His children to praise Him in everything and through every situation.</p><h2 class="head1">II. PRAISE AND VICTORY</h2>
<p>We have seen that our praise is a sacrifice. But there is more. We have to see that praising is the way to overcome spiritual attacks. Many people say that Satan is afraid of the prayers of God&rsquo;s children; he flees whenever God&rsquo;s children kneel down to pray. This is why he often attacks God&rsquo;s children and frustrates them from praying. This is a common attack. But we will point out another fact: Satan&rsquo;s greatest attacks are not aimed at prayers; his greatest attacks are aimed at praise. This does not mean that Satan does not attack prayers. The moment a Christian prays, Satan begins to attack. It is very easy to talk to people, but the moment one prays, Satan comes with problems. He will make one feel that it is hard to pray. This is a fact. But Satan does not attack just prayer; he also attacks the praise of God&rsquo;s children. The ultimate goal of Satan is to stop all praises to God. Prayer is a warfare, but praise is a victory. Prayer signifies spiritual warfare, but praise signifies spiritual victory. Whenever we praise, Satan flees. Therefore, Satan hates our praising the most. He will use all his strength to stop our praising. God&rsquo;s children are foolish if they stop praising when they suffer under adverse environments and downtrodden feelings. But as they come to know God more, they will find that even a Philippian jail can become a place of songs (Acts 16:25). Paul and Silas were praising God inside the jail cell. Their praise broke loose all the jail doors.</p>
<p>Jail doors were opened twice in Acts. Once they were opened to Peter and once to Paul. In Peter&rsquo;s case, the church prayed fervently for him, and an angel opened the door and brought him out (12:3-12). In Paul&rsquo;s case, he and Silas sang hymns of praise to God, and all the doors opened and the chains broke. The jailer believed in the Lord on that day, and his whole family was saved in a joyful way (16:19-34). Paul and Silas offered the sacrifice of praise in the jail. The wounds on their bodies were not yet healed; their pain was not soothed. Their feet were in the stocks, and they were shut in an inner jail of the Roman Empire. What was there to be joyful about? What was there to sing about? But there were two persons with transcendent spirits, who had surpassed everything. They saw that God was still sitting in the heavens; He had not changed at all. They themselves might have changed, their environment might have changed, their feelings might have changed, and their bodies might have been suffering, but God was still sitting on the throne. He was still worthy of their blessings. Our brothers, Paul and Silas, were praying, singing, and praising God. This kind of praise, which arises out of pain and loss, is a sacrifice of praise. This kind of praise is a victory.</p>
<p>When you pray, you are still in the midst of your situation. But when you praise, you soar above your situation. While you are praying and pleading, you are bound by your affairs; you are not out of them. The more you plead, the more you find yourself bound and pressed. But if God takes you above the jail, the chains, the painful wounds on the body, the suffering, and the shame, you will offer praises to His name. Paul and Silas sang hymns. They sang praises to God. They were brought by God to the point where the jail, the shame, and the pain were no longer a problem to them. They could praise God. When they praised in such a way, the doors of the jail opened, the chains fell off, and even the jailer was saved.</p>
<p>Many times praise works where prayer fails. This is a very basic principle. If you cannot pray, why not praise? The Lord has placed another item in your hands for your victory and for you to boast in victory. Whenever you run out of strength to pray and you find your spirit heavily oppressed, wounded, or sagging, praise Him. If you cannot pray, try to praise. We invariably think that we should pray when the burden is heavy and praise when the burden is over. But please bear in mind that there are times when the burden is so heavy that you cannot pray. That is the time for you to praise. We do not praise when there is no burden; we praise when the burden becomes too heavy. When you encounter unusual circumstances and problems and are bewildered and feel like collapsing, just remember one thing, &ldquo;Why not praise?&rdquo; Here is a golden opportunity. If you offer your praise at that moment, God&rsquo;s Spirit will operate in you, open all the doors, and break all the chains.</p>
<p>We need to learn to maintain this lofty spirit, this spirit that surpasses all attacks. Prayers may not bring us to the throne, but praise surely brings us to the throne at any time. Prayers may not enable us to overcome every time, but praise does not fail even once. God&rsquo;s children should open their mouths to praise Him, not only when they are free from problems, hurts, wounds, or difficulties, but even more when there are problems and wounds. When one lifts up his head in these situations and says, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You,&rdquo; his eyes may be filled with tears, but his mouth will be filled with praise. His heart may be in pain, but his spirit will still praise. His spirit will soar as high as his praise. He can ascend with his praises. Those who murmur are foolish. The more they murmur, the more they are buried under their murmurings. The more they complain, the more they sink into their complaints. The more they allow their problems to overtake them, the more exhausted they become. Many people seem to be a little more aggressive; they pray when they have problems. They strive and struggle to get out of their situations. Even though their circumstances and wounds try to bury them, they are not willing to be buried, and they try to get out by prayers. They often do manage to get out by praying. But there are also times when prayer does not work. Nothing seems to be able to deliver them until they praise. You need to offer up the sacrifice of praise. This means you need to consider praise a sacrifice and offer it up to God. When you put yourself in such an overcoming position, you immediately transcend everything, and no problem will be able to bury you. Sometimes you may feel that something is trying to run you over. But as soon as you praise, you will come out of your depression.</p>
<p>Let us look at 2 Chronicles 20:20-22. &ldquo;And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.&rdquo; Here was a battle. The nation of Judah was coming to an end at the time of Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s rule. It was very weak; everything was in a state of shambles. The Moabites, Ammonites, and the people of Mount Seir came to invade Judah. Judah was completely in despair; they felt that defeat was certain. Jehoshaphat was a revived king and a God-fearing person. Of course, none of the last kings of Judah was perfect, but nevertheless, Jehoshaphat was a person seeking after God. He told Judah to believe in God. What did he do? He appointed singers to sing praises to Jehovah. He also asked these ones to praise the beauty of holiness and to walk out before the army and to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.&rdquo; Please note the words <em>when they began</em> in the following verse. It is a very precious word. &ldquo;And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir.&rdquo; <em>When they began</em> means at that very moment. When everyone was singing praises to Jehovah, He rose to smite the Ammonites, Moabites, and the people of Mount Seir. Nothing moves the Lord&rsquo;s hand as quickly as praise. Prayer is not the fastest way to move the Lord&rsquo;s hand; praise is the fastest way. Please do not misunderstand that we do not have to pray. We need to pray, and we need to pray every day. However, we can overcome many things only by praising.</p>
<p>Here we see that spiritual victory does not depend on warfare but on praising. We need to learn to overcome Satan by our praise. We overcome Satan not only by prayer but also by praise. Many people are conscious of Satan&rsquo;s ferocity and their own weaknesses, and they resolve to struggle and pray. However, we find a very unique principle here: Spiritual victory does not depend on warfare but on praise. God&rsquo;s children often are tempted to think that their problems are too big and that they have to find some way to deal with their problems. They pay much attention to finding a way to overcome. But the more they try to come up with a way, the harder it is for them to overcome. In doing so, they put themselves on Satan&rsquo;s level. They are both in the battle; Satan is fighting on one side, and they are fighting on the other side. It is not easy to win from this position. But 2 Chronicles 20 gives a different picture. On one side was the army, and on the other side was the singing of hymns. These ones either had great faith in God, or they were crazy. Thank God, we are not crazy people. We are those who have faith in God.</p>
<p>Many of God&rsquo;s children are under severe trials; they are frequently tested. When the trials become severe and the warfare turns fierce, they are like Jehoshaphat. They are shut in by their trouble. One side is too strong, and the other side too weak; there is no comparison between the two. They are trapped inside the whirling wind. Their problems are too great and beyond their ability to overcome. At such times, it is easy for them to turn their attention to their problems; it is easy for their eyes to be set on their own difficulties. The more a man goes through trials, the easier it is for him to be bound by his problems. This becomes a great time of testing. The greatest test comes when he looks at himself or his environment. The more a man is tested, the more he tends to look at himself or his environment. But for those who know God, the more they are tested, the more they put their trust in the Lord. The more they are tested, the more they learn to praise. Therefore, we must learn not to set our eyes on ourselves. We must learn to set our eyes on the Lord. We should lift up our heads and tell the Lord, &ldquo;You are above everything; I praise You!&rdquo; Loud praises, praises that issue from the heart, and the praises that flow out of wounded feelings are the sacrifices of praise pleasing and acceptable to God. Once the sacrifice of praise ascends to God, the enemy, Satan, is defeated by the praise. The sacrifice of praise is very effective before God. Let your loftiest praises burst forth to God, and you will surely withstand and overcome. When you praise, you will find the way of victory opening wide before your eyes!</p>
<p>New believers should not think that they have to pass through many years before they can learn the lesson of praise. They should realize that they can start praising immediately. Every time you encounter a problem, you should pray for mercy that you would stop manipulating and plotting and that you would learn the lesson of praising instead. Much warfare can be won by praise. Many battles are lost because of the lack of praise. If you believe in God, you can tell the Lord in the midst of your problems, &ldquo;I praise Your name. You are higher than everything. You are stronger than everything. Your lovingkindness endures forever!&rdquo; A person who praises God transcends everything. He overcomes continually by his praise. This is a principle, and this is also a fact.</p><h2 class="head1">III. FAITH-PRODUCING PRAISE</h2>
<p>Psalm 106:12 is a very precious word. &ldquo;Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.&rdquo; This was the condition of the children of Israel in the wilderness. They believed, and they sang. They believed, so they praised. Praise has a basic ingredient&mdash;faith. You cannot praise vainly with the mouth. You cannot say in a flippant way, &ldquo;I thank the Lord! I praise the Lord!&rdquo; You must believe. Only after you have believed can you praise. When you have some problems or when you are sorrowful, you pray, and as you pray, a kind of faith rises up in your heart. At that moment you open your mouth to praise. This is the living way, but do not do this in a light manner. When a man is faced with a problem, he should pray. But as soon as he finds a little faith, as soon as he begins to believe in God and in His greatness, power, compassion, glory, and manifestation of His glory, he should begin to praise. If a man acquires faith but does not follow it up with praise, he will soon find that his faith is gone. We are saying this from our experience. Once you have faith within, you should praise. If you do not praise, you will lose your faith after a while. You may have faith now. But after a while, you will lose that faith. Therefore, we must learn to praise. We must learn to utter words of praise. We have to open our mouths to praise. We should have not only a mind to praise but also actual audible words of praise. You have to praise God in the face of all your problems and in the face of Satan. You should say, &ldquo;O Lord! I praise You!&rdquo; Do this until you turn from having no feeling to having feeling, or from having a feeble feeling to a strong feeling. Do this until you turn from little faith to full faith.</p>
<p>Once God&rsquo;s glory fills your eyes, you can believe. Once His glory fills your spirit, you can praise. You have to see that God is above everything and is worthy of your praise. When you praise, Satan flees away. Sometimes we need to pray. But when our prayer reaches the point where we have faith and assurance, we know that the Lord has answered our prayer, and we should praise: &ldquo;Lord! I thank You! I praise You! This matter is already settled!&rdquo; Do not wait for the matter to be over before you praise. We have to praise as soon as we believe. Do not wait until the enemy runs away to sing. We have to sing to chase him away. We have to learn to praise by faith. When we praise Him in faith, the enemy will be defeated and driven away. We have to believe before we can praise. First we believe and praise, and then we will experience victory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. OBEDIENCE BRINGING IN PRAISE</h2>
<p>Our problems mainly fall within two categories. The first category is problems arising from the environment and the affairs around us. This was Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s problem. The way to overcome this kind of problem is by praise. The second category is the problems within us. Words may hurt us. Others may offend, persecute, mistreat, oppose, hate us for no reason, or slander us without any basis. We may find these things unbearable, and we cannot get over them. These problems have to do with our personal victory. A brother may say something which is not proper. A sister may treat you in an unreasonable way. You may find it almost impossible to overcome these things. Your whole being may struggle, complain, and cry for justice. You may find it difficult to forgive or pardon others. It is hard for you to overcome your feeling. You are wronged, slandered, persecuted, and you cannot get over it. Prayer does not help much. You want to fight and struggle against it, but you cannot. The more you try to shake off this burden, the worse you become. You find it hard to overcome. Please remember that when you suffer great personal hardship and severe injustice, it is not the time for you to pray, but the time for you to praise. You should bow your head and say to the Lord, &ldquo;I thank You. You are never wrong in what You do. I accept all these things from Your hands. I thank You. I praise You.&rdquo; If you do this, all your problems will go away. Victory has nothing to do with struggling with the flesh. It has nothing to do with trying to forgive others or striving to pardon others with one&rsquo;s own strength. Victory comes when one bows his head and praises the Lord: &ldquo;I praise You for Your way. Your arrangement is always good. Whatever You do is right.&rdquo; When you praise the Lord this way, your spirit will soar above your problems; it will soar above your inner wounds. Those who are wounded in their feelings are short of praise. If you can praise the Lord, your hurt will turn into praise. Your spirit will transcend to the heights, and you will say to God, &ldquo;I thank and praise You. You are never wrong in all Your ways.&rdquo; This is the pathway we should take before the Lord. Leave everything behind. What a glory this is. This is truly a sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Christian life soars through praises. To praise is to transcend everything to touch the Lord. This was the pathway our Lord Jesus took when He was on earth. We should take the same way. We should not murmur against heaven when we are under trials. We should soar above the trials. Once we praise, we are above the trials. The more others try to put us down, the more we should rise up before the Lord and say, &ldquo;I thank You and praise You!&rdquo; Learn to accept everything. Learn to know that He is God. Learn to know the works of His hands. Nothing can ripen and mature a man like sacrifices of praise. We need to learn not only to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit but also to praise the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We need to learn not only to accept but also to glory in the Lord&rsquo;s dealing. We need to learn not only to accept the Lord&rsquo;s chastisement but also to accept it willingly with joy. If we do this, a clear and glorious door will be opened to us.</p><h2 class="head1">V. PRAISING BEFORE UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p>Finally, in Psalm 50:23 God says, &ldquo;Whoever offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me.&rdquo; Here, the word <em>thanksgiving</em> can also be translated as <em>praise.</em> The Lord is waiting for our praises. Nothing can glorify our God as praises can. One day, all the prayers, works, prophesying, and labor will be over. But on that day our praises will be more than today&rsquo;s. Praise will last for eternity; it will never cease. When we reach heaven and arrive at our final home, our praises will swell even higher. Today we have the opportunity to learn the best lesson; we can learn to praise God even today.</p>
<p>Today is still the time when we see in a mirror obscurely (1 Cor. 13:12). Although we can see a little of many things, we cannot understand the meaning behind them. We can only feel the pain of all the inward wounds and outward trials that we have encountered and experienced. We cannot comprehend the significance behind them. This is why we do not praise. We believe that praises will abound in heaven because there will be full knowledge in heaven. The fuller the knowledge, the fuller the praise. Everything will be clear when we go before the Lord on that day. The things that are unclear to us today will be clear to us on that day. On that day we will see the Lord&rsquo;s excellent will in every step of the Spirit&rsquo;s discipline. Had there been no discipline of the Spirit, we cannot imagine how much we would have fallen! If some of our footsteps had not been stopped by the Holy Spirit, we cannot imagine how pitiful our fall would have been! Many things, thousands and even millions of things which we do not see today, will become clear to us on that day. When we see everything on that day, we will bow our head and praise Him saying, &ldquo;Lord, You were never wrong.&rdquo; Every step of the Spirit&rsquo;s discipline is God&rsquo;s work in us. Had we not become sick that one time, what would have become of us? Had we not failed that one time, what would have become of us? What we faced may have been a problem, but through facing that problem we may have avoided greater problems. What we encountered may have been a misfortune, but through that encounter we may have avoided greater misfortunes. On that day we will see why the Lord allowed all these things to happen to us. Today the Lord is leading us on, every step of the way. On that day we will bow our heads and say, &ldquo;Lord, I was a fool, because I did not praise You that day. I was a fool, because I did not give thanks to You that day.&rdquo; When our eyes are opened and we become clear on that day, how very shameful we will be when we recall our murmurings. Therefore, today we must learn to say, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot understand what You are doing, but I know that You cannot be wrong.&rdquo; We have to learn to believe and to praise. If we do, we will say on that day, &ldquo;Lord! I thank You for Your grace which saved me from unnecessary complaints and murmurings. Lord! I thank You for the grace which kept me from murmuring during those days.&rdquo; For many things, the more knowledge we have, the greater will our praises be. We have a desire to praise the Lord because He is good (Psa. 25:8; 100:5). We need to always say, &ldquo;The Lord is good.&rdquo; Today we have to learn to believe that the Lord is good and that He is never wrong, even though we cannot always understand what He is doing. If we believe, we will praise. Our praises are His glory. To praise is to glorify God. God is worthy of all glory. May God gain abundant praises from His children.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">BREAD-BREAKING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:16-22; 11:23-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INSTITUTING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</h2>
<p>There is a supper in the church which all God&rsquo;s children should attend. This supper was instituted by the Lord Jesus on the last night He was on earth. He was to be crucified the next day. It was the last supper the Lord took on His last night on earth. Although He ate after His resurrection, that eating was different from ordinary eating. That eating was optional.</p>
<p>What was the last supper like? There is a history behind this supper. The Jews had a feast called the Passover; it was for remembering their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. How did God save them? God commanded the children of Israel to take a lamb, according to the house of their father, one lamb for a house, and slaughter it on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month. After that they had to take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of their houses. That night they ate the flesh together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. After the exodus from Egypt, God commanded them to keep this feast every year as a memorial (Exo. 12:1-28). Hence, to the Jews, the Passover was instituted as a reminder of their deliverance.</p>
<p>The last night before the Lord Jesus departed from the world was the very night of the Passover feast. After the Lord ate the Passover lamb with the disciples, He instituted His own supper. The Lord was trying to show us that we should take His supper in the same way the Jews took the Passover feast.</p>
<p>Let us compare these two matters. The Israelites were saved and delivered from Egypt, and they kept the Passover feast. God&rsquo;s children today are saved and delivered from the sins of this world, and they partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper. The Israelites had their lamb. We also have our Lamb&mdash;the Lord Jesus, the very Lamb of God. We have been delivered from the sins of the world, from Satan&rsquo;s power, and we are completely on God&rsquo;s side. Thus, we take the Lord&rsquo;s supper in the same way that the Jews partook of the Passover lamb.</p>
<p>After He celebrated the Passover feast, &ldquo;Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body. And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). This is the supper that the Lord instituted.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of a supper? It is a time when the whole family comes together to eat in peace after a day&rsquo;s work. It is not a hurried meal like breakfast or lunch. It is peaceful dining in full rest. This should be the kind of atmosphere among God&rsquo;s children when they partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper. They should not be in any haste. Their mind should not be busy thinking about this or that. Instead, they should enjoy their rest in God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The Lord used unleavened bread, instead of leavened bread, because He instituted His supper during the Passover (Exo. 12:15). The &ldquo;product of the vine&rdquo; spoken of in Matthew 26, Mark 14, and Luke 22 can also be translated as the &ldquo;fruit of the vine.&rdquo; During the bread-breaking meeting, we can use either grape wine or grape juice, as long as it is a product of the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Remember the Lord</h2>
<p>Why does the Lord want us to keep His supper? The Lord said, &ldquo;This do...unto the remembrance of Me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:25). Thus, the first significance of the supper is to remember the Lord. The Lord knows that we will forget Him. Although the grace we received is so great and the redemption we received so wonderful, our experience tells us that it is easy for man to forget Him. With a little carelessness, the newly saved ones can even forget the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. This is why the Lord purposely charged us: &ldquo;This do...unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to remember Him, not simply because we tend to forget, but also because the Lord needs <em>us</em> to have such a remembrance. The Lord does not want us to forget Him. He is much greater than we are; we could never fathom His greatness. We do not add benefit to Him by remembering Him. Still, for our sake, He said, &ldquo;This do...unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; The Lord has condescended Himself and has beckoned us to remember Him. He first condescended Himself to be our Savior. He also condescended Himself to win our hearts and gain our remembrance. He does not want <em>us</em> to forget Him. He desires that week after week we continuously live before Him and remember Him. He asks this so that we may gain spiritual blessings from Him. The Lord wants us to remember Him; this is His request in love. If we do not always remember Him and place His redemption before us, we will easily be entangled with the sins of the world. There will easily be quarrels among God&rsquo;s children. Our loss will indeed be very great. This is why the Lord wants us to remember Him. We are blessed when we remember Him. This is one way to receive His blessing. We receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace through remembering Him.</p>
<p>One great blessing in remembering the Lord is that we are separated from the power of the sins of the world. Once every few days we are reminded of how we received the Lord and how He died for us. By this we are separated from the sins of the world. This is one blessing we receive from breaking bread in remembrance of the Lord.</p>
<p>Another spiritual reason for breaking bread in remembrance of the Lord is to prevent God&rsquo;s children from having any quarrels or divisions. When I recall that I am saved and another brother also recalls that he is saved, how can we not love one another? As I consider that the Lord Jesus has forgiven my numerous sins and I see a sister coming to the Lord&rsquo;s supper who is also redeemed by the blood, how can I not forgive her? How can I hold her to her faults and make divisions based on this? Throughout the two thousand years of church history, many quarrels among God&rsquo;s children were resolved when they met together at the Lord&rsquo;s table. Animosity and hatred have dissolved at the Lord&rsquo;s table. When we remember the Lord, we also remember how we were saved and forgiven. The Lord has forgiven our debt of ten thousand talents. How can we seize our companion, who owes us a hundred denarii, and take hold of him by the throat? (Matt. 18:21-35). When a brother remembers the Lord, his heart is enlarged to embrace all God&rsquo;s children. He will see that all those redeemed by the Lord are loved by Him, and spontaneously he will love them as well. We cannot have envy, hatred, contention, and a lack of forgiveness when we are in the Lord. It is unreasonable for us to remember the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness of our many sins and yet quarrel with the brothers and sisters. We cannot remember the Lord if we are quarrelsome, envious, hating, and unforgiving. Therefore, whenever we gather together to remember the Lord, the Lord reminds us of His love and His work on the cross. He reminds us that all the saved ones are loved by Him. The Lord loves us and gave Himself for us. He gave Himself for us and for all those who belong to Him. He loves all those who belong to Him, and we spontaneously love all of His children because we cannot hate those whom He loves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This do...unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; We can never remember those people whom we do not know. We can never remember the things that we have not experienced. Here the Lord wants us to remember Him, which means we have already met Him at Golgotha and have already received His grace. We are here remembering what He has accomplished. We look back to remember the Lord in the same way that the Jews look back to remember the feast of the Passover.</p>
<p>Why are so many people lazy and unfruitful? It is because they have forgotten that their former sins were washed away (2 Pet. 1:8-9). This is why the Lord wants us to remember Him and to love Him. He wants us to remember Him all the time. We should remember that the cup is the new covenant enacted by His blood, which flowed out for us. We should also remember that the bread is His body given for us. This is the first thing we should emphasize in our bread-breaking.</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Declare the Lord&rsquo;s Death</h2>
<p>There is another significance to the Lord&rsquo;s supper. First Corinthians 11:26 says, &ldquo;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.&rdquo; When we eat the bread and drink the cup, we are declaring the Lord&rsquo;s death. The word <em>declare</em> can also be translated &ldquo;proclaim.&rdquo; It means to proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death to others. In charging us to take His supper, the Lord is asking us not just to remember Him but also to proclaim His death.</p>
<p>Why do the bread and the cup declare the Lord&rsquo;s death? Originally, the blood is in the flesh. When the blood is separated from the flesh, it means death has occurred. When we see the wine in the cup, we see the blood, and when we see the bread on the table, we see the flesh. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is on one side, and His flesh is on the other side. The blood is separated from the flesh. This is a declaration of the Lord&rsquo;s death. In this meeting there is no need for us to tell others, &ldquo;Our Lord has died for you.&rdquo; They know that death has occurred when they see that the blood is separated from the flesh.</p>
<p>What is the bread? It is wheat ground into powder. What is inside the cup? It is grapes that have been pressed. When you see the bread, you are reminded of ground wheat, and when you see the cup, you are reminded of pressed grapes. This clearly reminds us of death. A grain of wheat is only one grain; it cannot become bread unless it is first ground. Likewise, a cluster of grapes cannot become wine unless it is first pressed. If a grain of wheat tries to save itself, there will be no bread. Likewise, if a cluster of grapes tries to save itself, there will be no wine. Here the Lord spoke through Paul, &ldquo;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.&rdquo; We eat the grains that have been ground, and we drink the grapes that have been pressed. This is to declare the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Perhaps your parents, children, or other relatives do not know the Lord. If you take them to the meeting and they see the bread, they will ask, &ldquo;What is this? What is the meaning of this breaking of the bread? What is the meaning of the cup?&rdquo; You can respond, &ldquo;The cup signifies the blood and the bread signifies the flesh. These two things are apart. What does this show you?&rdquo; They will answer, &ldquo;This means death has occurred.&rdquo; The blood is on one side and the flesh on the other. The blood and the flesh are separate, and this implies death. We can demonstrate to all men that the Lord&rsquo;s death is displayed here. We should preach the gospel not only with our mouth, in the meeting hall, or with our gifts but also with the Lord&rsquo;s supper. This is one way of preaching the gospel. It would be a great thing in the universe if men would realize that taking the Lord&rsquo;s supper is not a ritual. We are declaring His death when we take the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, has died. This is a tremendous fact displayed before us.</p>
<p>In men&rsquo;s eyes, the Lord Jesus is no longer on the earth. But the symbols of the cross&mdash;the bread and the cup&mdash;are still here. Whenever we see the bread and the cup, we are reminded of the death of the Lord on the cross. This symbol of the cross reminds us of the constant need to remember the Lord&rsquo;s death for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.&rdquo; The Lord will surely come back again; this is a great comfort to us. It is particularly meaningful when we associate this coming with the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Do you not enjoy a good evening meal? Supper is the last meal of the day. Every week we partake of this supper of the Lord. The church has been partaking of the same supper week after week for nearly two thousand years. This supper still has not passed away. We continue to eat this supper. We wait and wait until the day the Lord comes back. When He comes back, we will no longer eat this supper. When we meet our Lord face to face, this supper will be no more. When we see Him again, we no longer will need to remember Him in this way.</p>
<p>Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s supper is for remembering Him and for declaring His death until He comes. The Lord&rsquo;s supper is for remembering Him. We hope that the brothers and sisters will focus their eyes on Him from the very start. When a person remembers the Lord Himself, spontaneously he remembers His death, and when he remembers His death, his eyes will spontaneously be set on the kingdom&mdash;the Lord will come again one day and receive us to Himself. The cross always leads to His coming; it always leads to glory. When we remember the Lord, we must lift up our heads and say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to see Your face; when I see Your face, everything else will fade away.&rdquo; The Lord wants us to remember Him. He wants us to declare His death continually and proclaim His death till He comes.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10 has another expression for the bread-breaking meeting. It does not call it a supper but a table. As a supper, which He instituted on the last night before His death, this meeting is for remembering Him and declaring His death till He comes. But this is only one aspect of the bread-breaking meeting. There is another aspect to the church&rsquo;s breaking of bread, which is signified by the Lord&rsquo;s <em>table</em> (v. 21). The meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s table is clearly defined in verses 16 and 17, which say, &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.&rdquo; Two things are signified here: fellowship and oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Fellowship</h2>
<p>The first thing signified by the Lord&rsquo;s table is fellowship. &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?&rdquo; Do we not share the Lord&rsquo;s cup when we meet? This is fellowship. First Corinthians 11 talks about the relationship between the disciples and the Lord, but chapter ten talks about the relationship between the saints. The supper is for us to remember the Lord, and the table is for us to have mutual fellowship one with another. &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?&rdquo; The emphasis here is not just the drinking of the blood of Christ but a joint participation in this blood. This joint participation is the fellowship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless&rdquo;&mdash;here the word <em>cup</em> is singular. The cup spoken of in Matthew 26:27 is also singular. According to the original text, the translation can be rendered, &ldquo;And, taking the cup and giving thanks, He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you.&rdquo; This is why we do not agree with using many cups, because once there is more than one cup, the meaning is changed. The cup which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? We receive of the same cup. The significance of having the same cup is fellowship. If we are not that intimate, we surely cannot drink out of one cup, each taking a sip out of it. God&rsquo;s children drink out of one cup. Everyone drinks from the same cup. One takes a sip, and someone else takes another sip. We have many, yet we drink out of the same cup. This signifies fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Oneness</h2>
<p>The second meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s table is oneness. &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:16-17). Here we see that God&rsquo;s children are one. The bread spoken of in chapter eleven has a different meaning than the bread spoken of in chapter ten. In chapter eleven the Lord said, &ldquo;This is My body, which is given for you&rdquo; (v. 24); this refers to the Lord&rsquo;s physical body. The bread in chapter ten refers to the church. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body&rdquo; (v. 17). We are the bread and this bread is the church.</p>
<p>We need to see the remembrance aspect, the declaration aspect, and the fellowship aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s table; we also need to see the oneness. All of God&rsquo;s children are one in the same way that the bread is one. We have only one bread. One person breaks off a piece of this bread and takes it. Another breaks off another piece and takes it. If all the little pieces that we break off and swallow are gathered together, do we not still have one bread? Though this bread is broken up and is inside every one of us, it is still one bread in the Spirit. Once the physical bread is consumed, it is gone, and we cannot gather the pieces back. But spiritually speaking, the bread is still one and it is one in the Spirit. Christ, like the bread, is originally one. God dispenses a little Christ into you and a little into me. The one Christ is now scattered and is dwelling in the many members. Christ is spiritual. Though He is scattered, He is not divided; He is still one. God gives Christ to you and to me, but in the Spirit Christ is still one. The scattered bread is still one in the Spirit; it is not divided. When God&rsquo;s children break bread, they not only remember the Lord, declare His death, and fellowship with one another, but they also acknowledge the oneness among themselves. This bread represents the oneness of God&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>The basic element of the Lord&rsquo;s table is the bread. This bread is very crucial. In a general sense, this bread represents all God&rsquo;s children. In a particular sense, it represents God&rsquo;s children in a particular locality. If some of God&rsquo;s children gather together and see only themselves and if their bread only includes the few of them, that bread is too small. It is not inclusive enough. The bread must include all of God&rsquo;s children in a locality; it must represent the church in that locality. This is not all. The bread must also include all of God&rsquo;s children on earth. We must see that this bread declares the oneness among God&rsquo;s children. If we want to establish a church that is our own, our bread is too small and cannot represent the whole church. If there is a table in a place and those attending that table cannot say, &ldquo;We who are many are one Body,&rdquo; we cannot partake of that bread because that is not the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>We must remember the Lord, and our hearts must be open to the brothers and sisters each time we break bread. All God&rsquo;s children, as long as they are redeemed by the precious blood, are included in this one bread. Our hearts need to be enlarged by the Lord; they need to be as large as the bread. Though we are many, we are one bread. Even those brothers and sisters who are not breaking bread with us are also included in this bread. If we put them aside completely when we break our bread, our bread is not big enough, and our heart is not big enough. This is not right. We cannot have the thought of excluding certain brothers and sisters or sending them away. This bread does not allow us to be narrow people.</p>
<p>If a brother who has never shared the bread with us comes to the Lord&rsquo;s table and if he is one who is joined to the Lord, he is also in this bread. Do we receive him or not? Please remember that we are not the host of this feast. At most we are the ushers. The table is the Lord&rsquo;s, not ours. The Lord sets up His table in a locality in the same principle that He first set it up in that large upper room; that room was borrowed. Today the Lord is merely using this place to set up His table. We cannot forbid others from breaking bread. This table is the Lord&rsquo;s. The authority to receive or not to receive is the Lord&rsquo;s. We do not have such authority. We cannot reject the ones whom the Lord receives, and we cannot reject anyone who belongs to the Lord. We can reject only those who are rejected by the Lord and those who do not belong to Him. We can reject only those who remain in sin and will not come out. We discontinue fellowship with them because they have discontinued their fellowship with the Lord. We cannot reject anyone who is received by the Lord. Likewise, we cannot receive those whom the Lord does not receive, those who have lost their fellowship with the Lord. Therefore, we must know a person very well before we can decide whether or not he should be received at the Lord&rsquo;s table. We should be very careful in receiving people for the bread-breaking meeting. We cannot be careless. It must be done according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. VARIOUS PERTINENT MATTERS CONCERNING<br />
THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>Finally, we have to mention two or three things. In particular, we have to take care of one matter in the bread-breaking meeting: As those who are cleansed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we do not come to ask for the cleansing of His blood. As those who have received the Lord&rsquo;s life, we do not come to ask for His life. Therefore, we should have only words of blessing in this meeting. &ldquo;The cup of blessing which we bless.&rdquo; Actually, we bless what the Lord has already blessed. On the night that He was betrayed, the Lord &ldquo;took bread and blessed it, and He took a cup and gave thanks&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-27). There the Lord only blessed and gave thanks. After the Lord broke the bread, He and the disciples came out singing (v. 30). The proper tone for this meeting is blessing and praise. In this meeting, we do not plead or preach. It may be all right to speak something directly related to the Lord. It may not even be necessary to do this. But definitely any other kind of preaching is unsuitable. (Paul&rsquo;s word in a bread-breaking meeting in Troas in Acts 20 was an exception.) We should restrict ourselves to only thanksgiving and praise in this meeting.</p>
<p>We break bread once a week. When the Lord instituted the supper, He said, &ldquo;This do, as often as...&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:25). The early church broke bread on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7). Our Lord not only died but also resurrected. We remember the Lord in resurrection. The first day of the week is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The most important thing on the first day of the week is to remember the Lord. I hope that all the brothers and sisters would not forget this.</p>
<p>We must also be counted &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; when we remember the Lord. First Corinthians 11:27-29 says, &ldquo;So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.&rdquo; The most important thing to remember when we come to the table is to be counted worthy. This does not refer to whether or not the person is worthy but whether or not his attitude is worthy. If a person belongs to the Lord, he can partake of the bread. If he does not belong to the Lord, he cannot partake of the bread. Thus, it is not a question of whether the <em>person</em> is worthy. It is a question of the attitude. It is wrong for us to be careless and not discern the body when we partake of it. This is why the Lord wants us to discern. Although there is no problem with our person, we must realize that we are partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s body while we are eating. We should not be careless, sloppy, despising, or loose in attitude. We must take it in a manner worthy of the Lord&rsquo;s body. The Lord has given us His blood and His flesh. We should receive them and remember the Lord in a godly way.</p></body></html>
