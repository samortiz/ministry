   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE WAY OF GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The old creation was created by God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The universe came into being through the Word of God John 1:1, 3; Heb 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God spoke and it was so Psa 33:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the new creation it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the word, God created us as the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 5:24 says, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other verses confirm that the word produced the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Peter 1:23 says that we were regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James 1:18 says that He brought us forth by the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word regenerates us, and the word enlightens us Psa 119:130, 105 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should study to find out how much the word of God does for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible reveals many other items of what the Word is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first item, the basic item, is that the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Colossians 3:16 the word is personified: Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Recently I began to realize that personification is implied here, based upon the word dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word dwell here Gk. enoikeo is from the root word meaning house Gk. oikos .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot say, Let a table dwell in your home or let the books dwell in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot even say, Let a dog dwell in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A dog is something living, but it is not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this verse the word of Christ is a personification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Paul s concept the word of Christ is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must let this Person dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To take in the word of Christ simply means to take Christ in. To let the word of Christ dwell in you is to let Christ dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot separate the word of Christ from Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, phrases such as the life of God, the light of God, the love of God, and the word of Christ denote something in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life of God means that life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The love of God means that love is God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word of Christ means that this word is Christ or that this Christ is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word and Christ are in apposition to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That Christ and the word are one is confirmed by Revelation 19:13.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The One who will defeat the Antichrist and his army is named The Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word of God is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SPEAKING AND PREACHING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throughout the entire Bible, especially in the New Testament, God sent His chosen people to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A number of times the New Testament, especially the Acts, simply refers to the word Acts 4:4; 8:4; 11:19; 17:11; 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 4:4 says that many heard the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts 17:11 some received the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word is something unique.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the early days, in the Acts, the saints must have used this term, the word, saying, Let us speak the word, or Let us preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our activity in propagating Christ must be through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have much to say, to teach, or to preach from the Word, we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I am filled with the Spirit, I will not simply practice the so-called gifts or speak in tongues which no one can translate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Testament, especially Paul, tells us that when the Spirit is upon the believers, the topmost aspects of the manifestation He gives is the word of wisdom and then the word of knowledge 1 Cor 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit will always do this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will not simply give the gift of healing or speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament tells us clearly that all the miraculous things can be done by the enemy Matt 24:24; 2 Thes 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you trust in these things, when the Antichrist comes with his prophet, you may be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will do great miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The biggest miracle will be that the image, the idol of the Antichrist, will speak Rev 13:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the prophecy of the New Testament, many will be attracted Matt 24:24; Rev 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will all be impressed and believe in the Antichrist because of the signs and wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Recently through an article I learned more concerning Mormonism in the days of Joseph Smith, its founder.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In those days the Mormons practiced miracles very much and spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They picked up the thought of Mark 16:17-18 speaking in new tongues, healing, picking up serpents, and drinking deadly things without being harmed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to this article Joseph Smith told a learned Methodist pastor that the Mormons had advanced further because they had picked up the miracles, healings, and tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One of the Mormons even encouraged certain Methodists to come with him to see many persons who would heal blindness, deadness, and so many diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They practiced according to the works of power of the coming age Heb 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The subtle one, Satan, can use all the miraculous things, but he can never use anything that is revealed or conveyed by the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have heard about things such as these many times, and have even seen them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once someone gets into the miraculous things, he gets addicted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must build on the solid rock of the divine Word, not on the sinking sand of the so-called gifts, as taught by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 7:24 through 27.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we behave, work, and live based upon His Word, whatever we are, whatever we do, how we behave, and how we work will be solidly based.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We will have the solid rock as our foundation, not sinking sand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The old creation was created by God s word and the new creation was also created by God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are still under the work of the solid Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we must pick up the solid Word for our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot preach God without His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot preach Christ without His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We cannot preach the gospel without the word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot minister grace and truth and life to others without the word of grace, the word of truth, and the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Word actually is our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without the Word how could you preach?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is impossible to preach anything without the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But hallelujah, what a big book we have the Bible, of sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The longest chapter in the entire Bible is Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is composed according to the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The one hundred seventy-six verses of that psalm are divided into groups of eight verses.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Each group of eight verses forms one section with a heading, a character of the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In those one hundred and seventy-six verses nearly every verse deals with the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Two words are very much used in this psalm the word and the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Likewise, the law is mentioned often.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In that psalm, the word, the testimony, and the law refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The law is God s testimony, and God s testimony is God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This psalm says, The entrance of thy words giveth light v. 130 . We should spend some time in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That was simply the word of the law, not the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of life, or the word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The ancient saints treasured that word to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They lived by that word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Today, the New Testament continues the Old to give us many more words.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The word is life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The word is so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The word enlightens us; the word regenerates us; the word transfers us out of death into life; the word sanctifies us and does many more things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do not have the adequate knowledge of the word, if we do not have a deposit of this word, an accumulation of this word, then how could we preach?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In China there were a good number of saints who were saved through the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They were very good brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, they found out they had no way to go on in that movement, so they turned to the way of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whoever had such a Pentecostal background was hard to help.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They had a heart to seek the Lord, but their background was too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>That background replaced the real knowledge and the full realization of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is hard to minister the word of life to those with a Pentecostal background.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Unconsciously they may hold on to their background.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is something deeply grounded and rooted in them.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is hard for one to dig it out and clear it away.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The only rescue for all of us is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I would beg you in love to put the Pentecostal things aside.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Forget about your background and come back to the pure Word of God, regarding yourself as knowing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Then you will be rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The word of the Bible, the Bible full of the word, will become a new book to you.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our problem today is the superficial replacement of Christ with the so-called gifts and the practice of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Even with this superficial, replacing practice, there is still something real.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We cannot deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In a very positive sense we are not standing against the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They are in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 still gave ground to these things, but he put the miraculous gifts at the tail of the list of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The top gifts are related to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The first aspect of the manifestation of the Spirit is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge 1 Cor 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The enemy can perform a deceit to imitate the manifestation of the Spirit by means of the miracles, but the enemy can never imitate by means of the word of wisdom and the word knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>You cannot receive the word of wisdom in a sudden, miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In 1 Corinthians 2:7 Paul indicated what the word of wisdom is But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Much wisdom is required to understand such a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This is why Paul used this word, mystery, indicating at least three things: first, the mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 ; second, the mystery of Christ is the church Eph 3:4-6 ; and third, putting these two together, there is the great mystery, Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>How much wisdom is needed to understand these mysteries!</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Therefore, Paul charged the deacons in the church to hold the mystery of the faith 1 Tim 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This can never be imitated.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We must come back to the divine way of using the Word to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Word is personified.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Even the coming triumphant Victor will be designated with such a title, The Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We must preach, teach, and speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>In the service, in the meetings, in our daily life, and everywhere, we must always speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We can have the assurance that when we speak the word, the word conveys the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The Spirit always honors the Word.</S>
