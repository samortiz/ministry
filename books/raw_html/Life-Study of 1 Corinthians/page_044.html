<h2 class="head1">DETERMINING TO KNOW ONLY CHRIST</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul continues, &ldquo;For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. For this he determined not to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ when he was about to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks. What a determination! It should be a pattern to us all.</p><p>The expression &ldquo;this One crucified&rdquo; indicates Christ&rsquo;s humiliation and abasement. His resurrection in glory (Luke 24:26) and ascension in exaltation (Acts 2:33, 36) are not referred to here because Paul&rsquo;s purpose is to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom.</p><p>According to verse 2, Paul determined not to know anything among the Corinthians except Christ and Him crucified. Some may appeal to this verse as a basis for arguing that Paul did not preach about the church, but only testified concerning Christ. We know from the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians that, beginning with chapter three, where Paul says that the believers are God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building, Paul has much to say about the church. In this Epistle he actually speaks more about the church than about Christ. Paul&rsquo;s meaning in verse 2 is that he determined not to know philosophy, culture, doctrine, religion, or any kind of practice. He cared only for Christ. But when Paul spoke of Christ, he included the church, for Christ is the Head of the church, which is His Body. In 12:12 Paul even indicates that the church, the Body, is part of Christ. Therefore, it is not correct to say that Paul excluded the church when he declared that he determined not to know anything other than Christ.</p><p>In verse 2 Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Dear brothers in Corinth, you are still very philosophical, and you live a life according to your wisdom. But when I came to you ministering God&rsquo;s mystery and announcing God&rsquo;s testimony, I did not rely on wisdom or philosophy. I certainly did not emphasize religion or culture. I spoke to you of a living Person, the Son of God, Jesus Christ. I determined not to know anything among you except this wonderful Person. I deliberately stayed away from philosophy, wisdom, and excellence of speech.&rdquo;</p><p>Paul also reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified. On the one hand, Paul did not use excellence of speech or wisdom; on the other hand, he proclaimed not an honored, exalted, glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, defeated, and even crucified. Here Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;You have believed in Christ and received Him with the initial gifts. But after receiving Christ, you made the mistake of not living a crucified life. On the contrary, you have lived a self-glorying and self-exalting life. But the One I preached to you and the One received by you was a rejected, despised, and crucified Christ. No longer should you live in a way to exalt yourselves. Rather, you should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ. You should not boast in your knowledge. Instead, you should be willing to give the impression that you do not know anything other than the crucified Christ. All of you are saying that you are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of a limited Christ. This is according to man&rsquo;s way, not according to the crucified Christ. You should live this One who was crucified.&rdquo;</p><p>There will always be trouble in a local church when the saints seek to know things other than Christ. Knowing too many doctrines often produces debates and even causes divisions. It is always profitable to know nothing but Christ and Christ crucified; this is the only safe way.</p><p>If all the saints in the local churches determine to know nothing except Christ Jesus, there will be no problems in the church life. The most wonderful local church is a church composed of saints who do not know anything other than Christ. Whenever they are asked a question, they reply that they only know Christ, calling on the name of the Lord, praying, and enjoying the Lord Jesus. They are willing to appear foolish by not knowing anything except Christ and this One crucified.</p><p>If the best local church is a church where the saints do not know anything except Christ, the church with the most problems is one where the saints know too many things other than Christ. More than forty years ago, I spent a long period of time trying to help this kind of church. My efforts were in vain, because everyone knew too much.</p><p>It is very important for us to determine not to know things and to learn to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Learn to determine not to know anything except Jesus Christ. Oh, we all must have such a spirit, attitude, and practice. If we determine not to know anything except Christ, there will not be any problems or divisions among us.</p><p>Sometimes when we visit a church in another locality, the saints there have questions about certain doctrines and practices. To answer their questions would be a big mistake and would waste much time and energy. Furthermore, we may waste the opportunity to minister Christ to the saints. We should be those who know only Christ and the Word of God. Then we shall have more opportunity to minister Christ to others.</p><p>The problem at Corinth was that the believers had too much knowledge. Furthermore, they treasured knowledge, even to the point of worshipping it and making it an idol. Therefore, it is not surprising that Paul&rsquo;s intention was to belittle their knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ.</p>
