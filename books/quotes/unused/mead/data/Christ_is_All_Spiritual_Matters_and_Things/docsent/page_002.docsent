   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE CHRIST IS THE WAY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 14:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows us something very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the way that God has given us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the truth that God has given us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the life that God has given us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is our way, Christ is our truth, and Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through Christ we go to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God s eyes, everything that has to do with God is Christ, who is His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why our Lord said, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. What God has given us is just Christ; He has not given us many things apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times, in spiritual matters, we see only things, and what we touch are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These things are merely terms and letters to us; they do not have any spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord open our eyes so that we may know the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The characteristic of Christianity, the root of Christianity, and all its depth and riches are contained in the knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a matter of how many methods we know or how many doctrines we have or how much power we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a matter of how much we know God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we know God s Son, we have the way, we have the truth, and we have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our power comes from our knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has given us His Son, not many individual items apart from His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The crux of the matter lies in our knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us now consider the meaning of I am the way, the truth, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CHRIST IS THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A way can be considered as a method.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord meant that He is the way for us to go to the Father; He is the method by which we can go to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have Him, we have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have Him, we do not have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have Him, we have the method.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not have Him, we do not have the method.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every true Christian has learned the lesson at least once that the Lord Jesus is the way; He is the method.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are saved, you have gone to the Father through the Lord Jesus as your way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You at least have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus is the way, and no one can go to God except through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every genuinely saved Christian knows that this is the only way that can be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thank the Lord that many genuine Christians have at least learned one lesson, which is to go to God through His Son, Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have taken this way at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This way is just Christ Himself; it is not a method apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see that not only do we have to come to God through the Lord Jesus when we are saved, but that the Lord Jesus is still the way any time we go to God; there is not some method outside of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some Christians are merely seeking for some methods to spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once a man was preaching on the subject of victory through Christ versus victory through ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After his message, another brother shook his hand and said, I have failed all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But today, everything is well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the first brother asked why, he answered, I have been seeking a method of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have found the method!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Victory is through Christ, not through ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first brother told him bluntly, If you have found a method, you will still fail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus told us, I am the way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, the Lord Jesus is the method.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A method is not something apart from the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The method is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If what we have is merely a method, it will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has not given us a method; He has given us His own Son.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We often hear of others experience and admire it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we do not realize that they have touched the Lord, while we have only seen a method.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, we fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The basic reason for this is that we do not realize that the Lord Jesus is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must remember that believing in the Lord and believing in a formula are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some Christians experience God s grace, and their eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They see the kind of persons they are, and they drop themselves and believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They trust the Lord to do what they themselves cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result they are satisfied in God, and they are liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A little while later, another person may come and, upon hearing the testimony of the first group, ask for God s enlightening also.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He asks for God to show him his worthlessness, and he learns to trust in God, to be humble, and to deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But strangely, the first group of people experiences deliverance, while the last man does not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One group is liberated, but the man is not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This happens because the first group of brothers have faith in God; they have touched the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the last brother does not have faith; he is merely copying the formula of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He has not received God, but a formula of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, the last brother has received a method from the first group of brothers; he has not received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no power in methods; methods will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They are dead because methods are things; they are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to remember that in spiritual matters, everything apart from Christ is death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some brothers and sisters say, It is so strange that when others have the faith, God answers their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I believe just the same, but God has not answered my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When others go to the Lord, the Lord is gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I do the same thing as they, but God does not grant the same grace to me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It seems as if they are putting the blame on God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They do not realize that they are believing in a thing; therefore, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A formula is worthless, and a method is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Only when we have Christ will everything be living.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even if you have learned all the methods, that will still not make you a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God s children are produced by begetting; they are not produced by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ is the way; He is the method.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Brothers and sisters, is your way Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Are your methods Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Or is your way just a way, and your method just a method?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If your method is Christ, everything will work out.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But if your method is only a method, even though it may truly be a good method or even the best and most correct method, it is still dead, and it has no spiritual value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Many prayers are not answered and many testimonies of believers have no effect on us because we have not touched the Lord; we have merely copied other peoples methods.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have not touched the Lord ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Once a brother was preaching on Romans 6 8.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After another brother heard it, he said: Today I know the way to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I believe that I will no longer fail as I did before.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Another brother came up to the preaching one and shook his head.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The preacher asked him what he meant, and he said, I cannot say what the first brother said.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord has opened my eyes, but I dare not say that I have seen Him, and I dare not say that I have not seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The second brother did not receive a method, but the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Eventually, he was able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But the brother who thought that he would never fall eventually failed because he had merely gained a method; he did not gain the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Therefore, it was worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many times, we are wrong even in the way that we listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We do not ask the Lord for revelation, and we do not ask to see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Instead, we exercise our mind to remember a method.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Actually, even if we followed the method exactly, we would still not see any result.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Sometimes, we may think that we have not seen very much; we may not be so confident as to say that we have seen the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But in fact, we have seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This seeing will bring about a real change in us.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Thank the Lord that this is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have not learned a method; rather, we know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The Lord shows us clearly that He is the method.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Every time we hear a message or a testimony, we should ask ourselves, Have I met the Lord, or have I merely understood a method?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The mere understanding of a method will not save us; only the knowledge of the Lord as our method will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>A testimony by others of how they have trusted the Lord will not save us; only our own trust in the Lord will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The words may be the same in both cases, but the facts are vastly different.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The Lord is the Lord of life.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Those who touch Him touch life, and only those who touch Him will live.</S>
