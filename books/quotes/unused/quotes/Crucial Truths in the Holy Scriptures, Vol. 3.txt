These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a great topic in the Bible, and it has been the subject of much debate throughout the past centuries
We look to the Lord for His special grace to bring us into the truth concerning this matter through the Spirit of reality who indwells us
If truth does not pass through the understanding of our mind, it will not be possible to receive it in our spirit
The significance of this distinction is great, particularly as it relates to the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit
In the past and even now, some emphasize objective knowledge of this matter whereas others emphasize subjective experience
Those who emphasize the objective aspect place too much emphasis on the doctrine of being filled with the Holy Spirit
If we want to accurately understand the filling of the Holy Spirit, we must understand what the Bible says about these two aspects
On the one hand, the Lord said that the Holy Spirit would be in us, and on the other hand, He said that the Spirit would be upon us
The Lord's expressions show that there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in relation to us: an inward aspect and an outward aspect
The Lord's promise before His death and His promise after His resurrection relate to the two aspects of the Holy Spirit
Most people think that the Lord's promise concerning the Comforter was not fulfilled until the day of Pentecost
He could not be touched by anyone before He placed the freshness of His resurrection before the Father in His ascension
Days later, however, He allowed Thomas to touch Him , which indicates that He had ascended to the Father on the morning of His resurrection
He was able to send the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the Son into the disciples so that we could call His Father our Father
According to the Bible, the Holy Spirit as the Comforter came on the day of resurrection, not on the day of Pentecost
The Lord's promise concerning the Comforter was not fulfilled on the day of Pentecost but on the day of resurrection
All these items are related to the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life; they are functions according to the aspect of life
The Comforter's convicting and guiding into reality are also the functions of the Holy Spirit in the aspect of life
Since the Spirit as power enables us to preach the gospel, it is obvious that His function in the aspect of power is for work
For our outward work, God gave us the Holy Spirit as power so that He could be the power, authority, ability, and skill of our work
On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell upon the disciples as power while they were in the upper room in Jerusalem
The promise of the Comforter is recorded by John in his Gospel and is also fulfilled in his Gospel ; John speaks of the Spirit of life
The promise of power, which is recorded by Luke in his Gospel and in Acts , is fulfilled in Acts ; Luke speaks of the Spirit of power
The descending of the Holy Spirit recorded by Luke fulfilled the promise of the Holy Spirit in the aspect of power
Although He was filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, the Holy Spirit did not descend upon Him until His baptism
These verses clearly show that there are two aspects of Lord's experience of the Spirit, an inward and an outward aspect
The Lord's speaking was surely not an empty promise nor was the Lord's breathing into them merely a lifeless demonstration
Although the Holy Spirit entered into the disciples on the day of resurrection, the Holy Spirit had not descended upon them
They experienced the Holy Spirit of life inwardly, but they had to wait to experience the Holy Spirit of power outwardly
Their inward life was not enough to enable them to testify and work for the Lord outwardly; they needed outward power
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John
When the apostles came and laid hands on them, they had a further experience of the Holy Spirit falling upon them
Ephesians 1:13 was written to the Ephesian believers, and it says that when a person believes in Christ, he is sealed with the Holy Spirit
When he was enlightened by the Lord and received the Lord on the road to Damascus, he surely received the Holy Spirit of life
He received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, however, three days later when Ananias came and laid hands on him
They are holy and godly with a proper human living and a careful manner in doing things, but they lack much in the aspect of power
Other believers, however, who are released and bold and who seemingly preach the gospel with power, are lacking in the inward life
It is possible to pay attention to life and neglect power, and it is possible to focus on power but neglect life
We must emphasize both aspects equally, paying attention to both the inward and the outward, pursuing both life and power
They overemphasized the outward aspect of power but overlooked and even denied the inward aspect of life because of ignorance
These brothers overemphasized the inward aspect of life and neglected and even opposed the outward aspect of power because of ignorance
We should check to see if we are lacking in either aspect, and if we are, we should pursue this lack in order to be balanced
The different aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit are even referenced in the New Testament with different words in Greek
In Greek two different words are used to speak of the Holy Spirit's inward filling and the Holy Spirit's outward filling
They were not filled with the Holy Spirit for a short period of time; they were constantly full of the Holy Spirit
Stephen was constantly full of the Holy Spirit inwardly; he was not one who was filled for only a short period of time
The Holy Spirit within us is the Spirit of life, and the inward filling of the Holy Spirit produces a maturity in life
John then indicated that the Lord's words referred to the Holy Spirit, whom those who believed into the Lord were about to receive
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control'
The fruit that the Holy Spirit bears within us is also an expression of being inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit
The order in which these nine fruits are listed is different from the order of the eight steps in 2 Peter 1:5-7
The first step toward being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit is to deal with our flesh by applying our co-death with Christ on the cross
The greatest enemy the greatest hindrance and the greatest problem encountered by the Holy Spirit in us is our flesh that lusts against Him
If we want the Holy Spirit to rule in us, to have a place in us, and to fill us, our flesh must be dealt with by the cross
We must apply our co-death with the Lord on the cross to our flesh, putting our flesh and all that is of the flesh to death
It needs to deal with our inward parts until they are empty, enlarging them so that the Holy Spirit can fill us inwardly
The flesh, the world, and sin that fill us must be dealt with by the cross in order to make room for the Holy Spirit
The extent to which we are filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly is the extent to which we have allowed the cross to deal with these things
When we do not allow our inward parts to be occupied by the flesh, the world, and sin, the Holy Spirit can immediately possess and fill them
If we truly deal with everything and offer ourselves to the Lord as His dwelling place, the Spirit of the Lord will come and fill us
The Holy Spirit is within us and desires to fill us; He is only waiting for us to give Him more ground in our being
After receiving the dealing of the cross and offering all of our inner being to Him, the Spirit will certainly fill us even more
Genuine Christian experience is based on faith, not feelings, and even if there are some feelings, faith takes precedence
Once we empty ourselves and consecrate ourselves to Him, we should believe that the Holy Spirit has already filled us inwardly
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit'
Since we consecrate ourselves to be filled by Him and believe He has already filled us, we should simply mind Him
In this short record, two different words, pleroo and pletho, are used to describe two different kinds of filling
Pleroo is used in the depiction of the Holy Spirit as a rushing violent wind that filled the house where the disciples were
The rushing violent wind that filled the whole house where the disciples were sitting was the Holy Spirit, or the power of the Holy Spirit
When we are baptized, water fills the baptismal pool inwardly, but it fills the person being baptized outwardly
With respect to the baptismal pool, there is an inward filling, but with respect to the person being baptized, there is an outward filling
The Lord prophesied concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit to the disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension
Suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
The first stage was fulfilled at Pentecost in Jerusalem and the second stage was fulfilled in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea
He may write two sections, and the first section may be written in Taipei, whereas the second section is written in Tainan
The baptism of the Holy Spirit was in two stages because the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not for individuals but for the church
The first stage was accomplished upon a group of believing Jews on the day of Pentecost in the upper room in Jerusalem
He accomplished this matter upon the Jewish believers first and then brought the Gentiles into the church through the Jewish believers
When this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, the disciples were outwardly 'filled with the Holy Spirit'
The Holy Spirit of power, like a rushing violent wind, filled the room in a way that water fills a baptismal pool
In this regard, baptism is not for the Holy Spirit to fill us inwardly but for the Holy Spirit to fill us outwardly
The Jews who were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost represented all the Jewish believers both past and present
The Lord gave Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens so that he could bring in the people whom the Lord needed to build the church
According to the Lord's word, Peter was charged with opening the door to the kingdom of the heavens for those who would believe in Him
If a Jewish person believes in the Lord today, does he need to go to Peter and ask him to open the door to the kingdom of the heavens?
Just as Peter opened the door for the Jews on the day of Pentecost, he opened the door for the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius
Other than these two instances, the Holy Spirit did not fall upon man as He did on the day of Pentecost and in Cornelius's house
The baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished by the Lord on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius
The Bible refers to the baptism in the Holy Spirit only in regard to the events on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius
Consequently, when we believe in the Lord we partake of this accomplished fact whether we are a Jew or a Gentile
In God's eyes, according to the fact, he has already been baptized in the baptism of the Spirit which was poured out upon the church
If a family receives a large inheritance, a child who is born as a member of the family will be able to partake of that inheritance
When a Jew believes in the Lord, he partakes of the baptism in the Holy Spirit that the Jewish believers received on the day of Pentecost
Those who are in the church were baptized in the Holy Spirit as a whole, corporately, and once for all, not individually or separately
All the believers in the church, regardless of when they live or where they live, partake of this accomplished fact
When we are outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit of power falls upon us, we experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Partaking of the fact of the baptism in the Spirit is one thing; experiencing the baptism in the Spirit is another
His older brothers, however, will not only receive the inheritance in fact and in name but also enjoy the inheritance in their experience
Being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly is for our spiritual living and causes our spiritual life to mature
Being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly is for our spiritual work and causes our spiritual work to have power
At Pentecost, those unlearned Galilean fishermen received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit upon them, and they were greatly released
If the brothers and sisters in our gospel groups were all filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, people would be moved whenever we went out
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified'
The outward filling with the Holy Spirit not only gives us power to testify for the Lord but also proves Jesus' ascension and exaltation
When the Holy Spirit falls upon us, not only do we feel our heavenly condition, but others can sense our heavenly condition
When the early apostles stood up on the day of Pentecost and testified of the ascended Lord, the listeners noticed their heavenly condition
Peter and the first one hundred twenty disciples were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
They were all outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues even as the Spirit gave them to speak forth
They were in such a released condition that people jeered and said that they were full of new wine as if they were drunk
They not only received the Holy Spirit at this point, but they continued to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit
The New Testament gives three other examples of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit before the day of Pentecost
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues'; 'They heard them speaking in tongues'
When the Ephesian believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, they not only spoke in tongues but also prophesied
The other two instancesthe Samaritan believers in chapter 8 and Saul of Tarsus in chapter 9do not mention the matter of speaking in tongues
We dare not preach, as certain groups preach, that a person must speak in tongues in order to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit
When the disciples at Pentecost and the Samaritan believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, others saw it
When a person is filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, there will be a heavenly, spiritual condition that others can see
When we repent and turn to God, after we have dealt with and cleared up our sins, we must believe that we are baptized in the Holy Spirit
If we want to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must pray individually, and we should pray together with one accord
Under normal conditions, believers will receive the Holy Spirit when a representative of the Body lays hands on them
Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation'; 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations'
According to His sovereign authority, the Lord effects changes among humanity that reflect the actions initiated by His calling
The Lord will continue to sound His call, calling some to bring the gospel to those living in every corner of the earth
If we do not preach the gospel we feel that we have let people down that we owe them something and that our heart is empty and without peace
When we receive His salvation, we also receive His commission and spontaneously feel a spiritual responsibility
Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you'
The Lord wanted him to witness to his own people and report to them the great things He had done for him and how He had mercy on him
Once we are saved, we should report the salvation that we received to our relatives and friends and should witness to them
When she realized that the Lord was the Christ, she left her waterpot and went into the city where she lived and testified of the Lord
A new believer should witness for the Lord because the witnessing of a newly saved one can easily move people to believe into Him
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus
These instances show that once a person knows the Lord, he should lead others to the Lord, particularly his relatives and friends
If Philip had said anything more than this, he could have made more mistakes that would have confused Nathanael and caused him to doubt
When we preach the gospel to people, we are sowing the seed of the Lord's gospel into the field of their hearts
The seed of the gospel, which was sown into him through the tract, was reaped and brought in by us five years later
The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest'
In these verses the Lord spoke of the harvest being great, but the workers who preach the gospel to reap the harvest being few
According to this expression, preaching the gospel to our relatives, friends, and those to whom we are close is the repayment of a debt
When our spirit is full of burden, it becomes a power within us and causes us to be so driven that we cannot help but preach the gospel
We should become a 'fanatic of Jesus' to the extent that we do not care for anything but announcing the Lord Jesus
When he was in Athens, the apostle Paul was provoked in his spirit because he saw that the whole city was full of idols
If we want to preach the gospel, we must be 'thick-skinned'; if we want to be thick-skinned, we must have the spirit of the gospel
With the spirit of the gospel and 'thick skin,' we will feel glorious rather than ashamed when we preach the gospel
Regardless of whether a person is a manager, doctor, nurse, college student, or just a common person, everyone has a throne of human dignity
For the sake of the gospel, he was willing to lower himself so that he might become a fellow partaker of the gospel
He was a person who came down from his throne, discarded his self-importance, and was full of the spirit of the gospel
A person full of the spirit of the gospel does not care for himself and loves money even less consequently the gospel can be released by him
He told the patrolman that he must believe in the Lord Jesus and that if he did not believe, he would go to hell
A living that is unworthy of the gospel hinders people from accepting the gospel and from believing in the Lord
Often we cannot bring people to salvation or bring more people to salvation because we have not received enough dealing from the Lord
The Lord will deal with the brother through his circumstances in order to break him so that he can receive the Lord's pruning and cutting
The number of people that we can bring to salvation depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord
If we had power last year but not this year, we must receive fresh dealings in order to have fresh power to bear fresh fruit
We need to let the Lord prune what needs to be pruned and to break what needs to be broken in order to bear fresh fruit
Since preaching the gospel results in demons being cast out, demons can have some ground in those who do not believe and receive the gospel
When a policeman stands at an intersection and raises his hand, cars stop because of his authority, not his power
According to the Lord, we must deal with demons by using authority, not power, and He has given us authority to overcome the power of demons
We should apply His authority by faith to deal with all the demons who oppose the gospel, usurp people, and cause them to reject the gospel
When the Lord wanted to cross the sea with the disciples to cast out demons, Satan raised up a storm to hinder the Lord
When the apostle Paul was in Paphos on the island of Cyprus, Satan stirred up a man called Bar-jesus to oppose him
Put on power from on high'; 'You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses
The Holy Spirit promised by God came upon them and caused them to receive power from on high; then they preached the gospel
According to position, we have the authority of Christ; according to condition, we need the power of the Holy Spirit
We should confess and apply the authority of Christ by faith, and we should pursue and receive the power of the Holy Spirit by faith
We must have the authority of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit so that our preaching of the gospel would be with authority and power
When the brothers and sisters preach the gospel, they often visit people in a loose way and say the same thing to everyone
He spoke the word that the Holy Spirit directed him to speak in that instant, so it was a living, powerful word
We should pay attention to, pursue, and learn how to be led by the Spirit in the matter of preaching the gospel
While he was speaking, he shouted 1 Corinthians 1:18: 'The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness'!
A Japanese man heard this word as he was going past the meeting place to a bad part of town to engage in sinful things
We should bring others to know Him, believe in Him, receive Him, turn to Him, and confess Him as their Savior and Lord of all
Everyone must have one spirit one heart and one will so that the power and blessing of the gospel can be brought into the church
When the church preaches the gospel, the brothers and sisters should not merely fellowship but also strive together with one soul
He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, / Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout, / Bearing his sheaves with him'
He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together'
If a brother preaches the gospel to his associates at work, they will not ask him to go to a show or to gamble on the Lord's Day
His spiritual walk will not be injured by the world; instead, he will walk in the Lord's way with a spiritual beauty
For this reason Paul exhorted the believers through the compassions of God to present their bodies a living sacrifice in service to Him
The word slave is not a very pleasant expression when it is applied to unbelievers in the world, because it often denotes an inferior status
The word slave is a felicitous and glorious expression when it is applied to believers because we are serving the Lord
Colossians 3:22-24 shows that actual slaves were serving the Lord when they served according to the Lord's will
The Lord's will is for every one of us to serve Him, but serving Him does not necessarily mean we must become a preacher
Similarly, there are many believers who love the Lord and truly live to Him, even though they have a career or job
According to the Bible, we are not called to make a profession out of preaching; rather, we are called to serve the Lord
Because our service to the Lord is the service of a slave, we should act according to the Lord's will, not according to our own desires
Those who serve the Lord must hear the Lord so that they can know His will and serve according to His desire in order to please Him
In serving the Lord we need to fast and pray to seek Him in addition to contacting Him and standing before Him
Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and you be like men waiting for their own master when he returns'
We must be clear about the ministry that the Lord has allotted to us and know the course that the Lord wants us to finish
Each member has a function, and all these functions belong to the Body of Christ and are for the Body of Christ
Consequently, in the church we must coordinate with one another in the service with all the saints, our fellow members
If we want to serve in coordination with all the saints in the church, we must deal with our individualism in spiritual matters
We must go through the dealing of the Holy Spirit and the breaking of the cross in order to have the coordinated service of the church
Because we are members of the Body of Christ, our function is both of the Body of Christ and for the Body of Christ
According to the rule and principle, we must live in the Body of Christ, the church, in order to manifest our function as members
If our hand is separated from our body, it will not only lose its function; it will also become something quite frightening to others
They are separated from the church, they have lost their function as members, and they have become quite frightening to others
The service of the church is a coordinated service of the Body of Christ, and every member needs to participate according to his function
Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God
That slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes'
Since we know that it is the Lord's will for us to serve Him, we will not escape His punishment if we do not serve according to His will
They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together
Realizing that they were headed in the wrong direction and to the wrong place, they immediately rose up and returned to Jerusalem
While they were meeting, the Lord came into their midst; they received the blessing of His appearing and experienced His presence
He did not outwardly fill the individual believers who were separate from one another; He filled the disciples who were in the meeting
The meetings enable us to care for one another, exhort one another, and incite one another to love and good works
The meetings cause us to have spiritual fellowship with all the saints and to receive the life supply from the saints
If we cease to meet, we will not only lose the blessings of the meetings, but we also will develop a habit of not meeting
One day during winter a co-worker went to visit the brother, and he saw a fire burning in the fireplace of his living room
He took the coals out of the stove, allowed them to cool, and then scattered them on the floor of the living room
When the brother returned home and saw coals scattered over the floor and no fire in the fireplace, he was very angry
Satan has taken you out of the stove of the meetings, causing you to leave the church so that you are no longer burning'
They provide us with a clear sense of the Lord's leading, a sense that we often cannot obtain through our seeking of the Lord by ourselves
In the meetings light shines on specific portions of the Bible that are beyond our understanding in our personal study of the Word
We must fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the grace of God and supply others with His grace through this fellowship
When our spirit is open, we can supply others with the grace that we have received through prayers, a hymn, or a short word
Once our spirit is released, grace and light will come, darkness and error will disappear, and everyone will receive the supply of life
Eating the Lord's supper emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord through eating His bread and drinking of His cup
The first section extends from the beginning of the meeting until the passing of the bread and wine has been completed
We should think only of the Lord's person and work, that is, how the Lord is God yet man, how He is our Lord, our Savior, and our all
We should also consider how He loves us, having accomplished redemption for us, intercedes for us, graces us, upholds us, and cares for us
These things do not relate to our remembrance of the Lord; they should be considered in the fellowship and prayer meetings
When the Lord Jesus finished breaking bread with His disciples, they sang a hymn to the Father before He led them to the Mount of Olives
Through death and resurrection, the only begotten Son of the Father has dispensed His life into us, making us the many sons of God
In resurrection He leads us, as His many brothers, to worship and praise the Father with Him in His position as the Firstborn
After eating the bread and drinking the cup, we should willingly follow Him in spirit in the worship of the Father
If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens
Prayer was being made fervently by the church to God'; 'There was a considerable number assembled together and praying'
If we do not practice this, the atmosphere of the prayer meeting will be very heavy, and little prayer will be released
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
There must be an interpreter; otherwise, the one speaking in a tongue should be silent, speaking to himself and to God
A person who wants to speak for God as an oracle of God should control his spirit since the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets
The goal of meeting to exercise spiritual gifts is the building up, so everything must be done becomingly and in order
When this letter is read among you cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also and that you also read the one from Laodicea
Home meetings have their benefit and flavor, and meetings of the whole church together in one place have their benefit and flavor
Since the Bible is the word of God breathed out through His Spirit, the words in the Bible do not represent the ideas of man
These men spoke while being borne by the Holy Spirit, just as a sailboat is blown, borne, and moves with the wind
The books of the New Testament, which were written by the Lord's disciples after His ascension, come from the Holy Spirit's revelation
It is the word of God that the priests received , and it is the speaking of the Spirit of God through the prophets
The New Testament is the word spoken by God in the Lord Jesus and the word declared by the Holy Spirit and then written by the apostles
The Lord Jesus is the subject and content of the Bible, and the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus
If the written Word the Bible did not have the living Word the Lord Jesus as its reality it would be nothing but empty doctrines and letters
It reveals God's way of salvation in Christ and our pathway to salvation through faith so that we may know and understand God's salvation
For teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete'
For our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope'
When we read the Bible, we can be warned by the experiences of some who went before us, and we can be careful not to follow their example
If we read the Bible and keep the word of the Bible in our heart, it will become a lamp to our feet and a light to our path
If we store the words of the Bible in our heart, they will constantly remind and warn us so that we do not sin against God
When the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness, He defeated the tempter, the devil, through the word of the Old Testament
We must be familiar with the Bible and be able to use it to deal with spiritual enemies at any time and in any place
It can deal with our spiritual enemies, but it can also divide our soul from our spirit and discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart
It also enables us to discern the thoughts and intentions that come from ourselves and those that come from God
When the will in her soul is divided from God's will in her spirit, she will be saved from the desires of her flesh in this important matter
The word will always expose our real condition, bringing our situation into the shining of the light from His face
We also must exercise to understand the more difficult portions in the Bible in order to be full-grown men, who are able to eat solid food
Newly regenerated believers must love the word of the Bible and 'as newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word'
The Lord uses the water of life within us to wash us through the word of the Bible, eliminating the spots and wrinkles of the old creation
The word of the Bible manifests these functions, especially in relation to us as God's farm , the harvest that God cultivates
Whether the refreshing is like rain or snow, the word causes us to grow and bear fruit, and it will accomplish God's delight upon us
The Bible functions in a sweet way to restore and refresh our soul, to make us wise, to make our heart joyous, and to enlighten our eyes
The word of the Bible enables us to have Spirit and life; it causes us to receive life from the Spirit and to live according to the Spirit
Often the word of the Bible is far better than the ideas or suggestions of any counselor, strategist, or consultant
There are sixty-six books in the Bible, yet every sentence is pure like silver that has been purified seven times
Every person who has earnestly read the Bible confesses that no other book in the world is as perfect and faithful as the Bible
All the spiritual blessings that we receive in the Lord today are heavenly; they cannot be seen with our physical eyes
If anyone genuinely touches the word of the Bible, he touches the power in the Bible because the Bible is the Word of God
If we only use our eyes to read the Bible, but our heart is not inclined to it in our reading, it will be difficult to understand the Bible
Children and young people especially need to spend time learning to know the Bible when their intellect and memory are adequate and strong
We should ask the Lord to open our mind and give us an understanding that transcends our natural intellect in order to understand the Bible
We must believe in our heart and use our believing to receive the word into our heart in order for the word to benefit us
Many bear burdens, experience difficulties, overcome temptations, and deal with problems by trusting in the word of the Bible
Seeking, proving, and studying are related to the mind, and they require time and energy to search the Word of God
When we have the word of the Bible in our hearts, we can apply it to any situation, even if we do not have the Bible in our hands
Their hearts are storehouses of worldly knowledge and many things, but they have not stored up the word of God
In order for them to have a turn in spiritual matters, they must learn to let the word of the Bible dwell in them richly
We must use the word of the Bible to make ourselves happy, and we should remember the word of the Bible forever
Both speaking and declaring tell others about the word of the Bible, and we should bear responsibility for both
Both explaining and speaking clearly tell people about the word of the Bible so that the truths and teachings of the Bible can be understood
If New Testament believers, who are under grace, are taught to keep the law of the Old Testament, the boundary of the age has been crossed
We must know the word that refers to salvation, to reward, to the grace we have received, and to our responsibilities
We must cut straight these truths in the Bible according to their boundaries in order to know the Bible properly and to avoid error
When we come to a difficult portion in the Bible, we should not twist; we should not force ourselves to explain if we do not understand
We do not have the authority to add to or to take away from the word of the Bible because of its completeness and divine authority
Neither adding nor taking away is related to receiving blessing, whereas adding and taking away are related to receiving cursing
Just as our food should be apportioned to us throughout the day, our Bible reading should be apportioned in a measured and daily way
Indeed, in order to gather the manna that we need for our spirit from the Bible, we must get up early every morning
Should we not also get up early every morning to read the Bible hope in Gods word muse on Gods word and listen to and receive Gods word
If we are lazy and love our beds in the morning, we will not be able to gather the manna that we need for the day from the Bible
If we do not hate our bed and get up early in the morning we will not be able to gather the manna of Gods word from the Bible in the morning
If we come to the Lord's Word and read the Bible in the morning, it will supply us to meet our needs throughout the day
If we do not come to the Word, we will lack the power to deal with things or to overcome the temptations of the day
We must ask the Lord to open our mind so that we might understand the truth in the Word and behold wondrous things
When we read the Bible, we should not depend on our intelligence but seek the enlightenment and revelation of the Holy Spirit
It takes a spiritual person to understand spiritual words, and it takes a spiritual person to understand spiritual matters
If we want to understand the Bible, we must be spiritual, learn to live in the Spirit, and become a spiritual person
Whether we understand the Bible and receive light when we read it depends on our spiritual condition and our heart
Even though many have spent much time to study the Bible throughout the ages, there are still many portions that need to be studied
S, who have spent an entire lifetime carefully studying the Bible, feel as if they are trying to measure the ocean with a dipper
Others calculated the numbers represented by every letter of every word in the Old Testament Hebrew and the New Testament Greek
The numeric total of every word in every verse in every chapter in every book of the Bible is divisible by seven
Many times we need to meditate, consider carefully, or concentrate quietly in order to understand the Bible and touch its essence
Whoever does not read the Bible in faith, whoever is slow of heart to believe, cannot understand the Bible in a clear way
We should not use our mind to understand the Word but our spirit to taste and chew a portion of the Word so that it becomes our supply
We should memorize one book of the Bible or choose a few golden verses from our daily reading to remember and memorize
One copy should be used to record inspiration and to underline important points; the other copy should not contain any of our writing
When we read, we should read from the clean copy and record inspiration or underline a portion in the writing copy
One line should be the New Testament, which can be called the line of life because our emphasis should be on the nourishment of life
It is best to read one chapter of the New Testament every morning for twenty to thirty minutes, choosing one or two verses to pray-read
The other line should be the Old Testament, which can be called the line of knowledge because our emphasis should be on knowing the Bible
In this way we can read from both the Old and New Testaments every day, and in one year we will read through the whole Bible
When we read from either the Old or New Testament, it is best to read from the first book to the last, chapter by chapter
We may have a feeling about verse 21: 'You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins'
We can immediately turn this inspiration into prayer, asking the Lord to save us from our sins, according to the meaning of His name
Finally, if we have a sense of the preciousness of the Lord's names in verses 21 and 23, we should memorize these two verses
We need a certain level of spiritual life to understand the Bible because our understanding is proportional to our level of spiritual life
The longer books are referred to as the major prophets, and the shorter books are referred to as the minor prophets
The Jews and their rabbis divided the Old Testament according to Luke 24:44: the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms
In the Old Testament God used types as pictures to depict the truths that would be revealed in the New Testament
Before God's salvation was manifested, God typified His salvation through the event of the children of Israel leaving Egypt
The prophecies concerning the second coming of Christ and other unfulfilled prophecies will certainly be fulfilled literally
No prophecy can be interpreted in isolation from other Scripture; we must see how it relates to other prophecies on the same subject
The period of time from the creation of Adam to the end of the millennial kingdom can be divided into seven dispensations
The dispensation of innocence-from the creation of Adam to his being driven out of the garden of Eden, at most 130 years
The dispensation of human government-from Noah's leaving the ark to the dispersion at the tower of Babel, 427 years
After man could fall no further, God came in and called Abram , promising him that He would bless man through his seed-Christ
The dispensation of law-from the giving of the law on Mount Sinai to the ministry of John the Baptist, about 1,500 years
Through the law, man was shown that he could not do good nor be justified in himself so that he would seek God's grace
God sent the Lord Jesus to fulfill His promise of grace enabling Him to deal with man through grace and enabling man to live under His grace
The dispensation of the kingdom-from Christ's coming to reign as King to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years
The dispensation of the kingdom-from the second coming of Christ to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years
During this time the church was a hidden mystery ; consequently, only Gentiles are mentioned in addition to the Jews
During this time the Jewish nation is temporarily set aside, even though God pays attention to Jews and Gentiles as individuals
The original world in Genesis 1:1 is covered with water in verse 2, prior to the initiation of God's dispensations with man
At the conclusion of the seven dispensations the world will be burned with fire and there will be a new heaven and new earth
The life within every Christian is a praying life, and every life has a capacity and a desire to function in certain ways
If we respond to this praying capacity and pray often, this capacity will be developed, and its desire will be satisfied
He has the opportunity to tempt us in matters related to food and clothing, occupations, money, marriage, and many other matters
If we watch and pray in every matter, we will be preserved by the leading of God and will not enter into the temptation of the devil
On the one hand, this sends out a warning, but on the other hand, it receives an echo which directs its course
Sometimes we come across a patch of fog that makes it difficult for us to know the direction that we should take
At these times we should pray, as if we are sounding a foghorn, so that we can avoid danger and know how to move forward
Prayer and petition are the way to utilize the armor of God and to cause the armor of God to have an effect upon us
We can receive God's mercy and grace for timely help by frequently touching His throne and contacting Him in our spirit
When Peter was praying in the city of Joppa, he saw a vision and knew that God wanted him to go and preach the gospel to the Gentiles
When we call unto the Lord-when we pray-we not only receive an answer, but He also tells us great and hidden things
We can be directed by the Lord concerning a great and difficult matter, one that is not easy to understand, if there is sufficient prayer
According to the Lord's word, great tribulation will come upon the people of the whole earth at the end of the age
Watching and praying are very much related to our future; therefore, we should realize the importance of prayer and pay attention to it
In the Bible the Lord clearly tells us that He will return, and He solemnly commands us to watch and wait for His coming
We must realize that as the end of the world and the things in the world draw nearer, they will entangle and bewitch people even more
Being sober unto prayers is especially important given the entangling and bewitching influence of the world and the things in the world
These two passages of the Word reveal a principle: Even when God determines to do something for man, man still must pray before God will act
When God determines to do something, His determination is anointed through the Holy Spirit into those who love Him and draw near to Him
When he prays, God will listen and save the person whom He has determined to save and who has been cared for through prayer
He causes them to pray for the matter that He has determined in His heart, and then He hears their prayer and accomplishes the matter
Many times a breach between the brothers and sisters, such as a problem in the church, requires prayer in order for the breach to be filled
When God wants to work on His children He needs people to command Him to do what He desires according to His hearts desire and determination
Prayer that commands God concerning His work can and should be practiced by those who know Him and His heart's desire
When we come to the Lord, we should not pray according to our own determination or idea or according to our own heart or tendency
We should place ourselves before the Lord and quietly wait for the Lord through His Spirit to teach us how to pray
While we wait, the Spirit will lead us and give us an inward sense about how we should pray and the content of our prayer
When our inward sense is according to the Spirit's leading, our prayer will be according to the Lord's teaching and leading
When we abide in the Lord, fellowship with Him, and are one with Him practically in our experience, we spontaneously pray in His name
Praying in the Holy Spirit Praying at every time in spirit The Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
If we pray according to the feeling of our deepest inward part, we will also pray in the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Spirit
The Lord's word here may also indicate that when we pray, we should not allow anything to distract and disrupt our prayer
Even if our circumstances do not allow us to be in a hidden place, we should not allow outside things to affect our concentration in prayer
No matter what person or thing we pray for, our heart should not be directed toward the persons or matters of our prayer
The Lord as the Son of David was for the chosen race of Israel and was not related to a Gentile Canaanite woman
Finally, she prayed based on the word dog, which came from the Lord's mouth, and stood in the position of a Gentile dog
The titles and words that we use in prayer are one of the secrets of prayer, and they can cause our prayer to be answered
Although we can repeat our words as the Lord did in the Garden of Gethsemane, we should not babble empty words
We should ask for the Lord's blessing, seek the Lord Himself, and knock to enter into the presence of the Lord
Prayer should always move from the Lord's blessing to touching the Lord Himself and then to entering into His presence
By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance'
Prayer also needs to be at every time, by means of all prayer and petition, and with watching in all perseverance
When we go to a mountain to pray, our heart can be free, and we will feel closer to God than when we pray in our home
When we pray at night, our heart and spirit also can be quiet, and we can touch God more deeply than when we pray during the day
God has committed Himself to us in His Word; He wants us to command Him to do the things that we agree with according to His desire
To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us'
He wanted to wait until Lazarus had died and was buried so that He would have an opportunity to express His resurrection power
Carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them'?
He did not understand why the Lord allowed this to happen, but when he was in Africa, some natives saw him and wanted to eat him
We even think that He is wrong, but the subsequent facts prove that His answers are indeed appropriate and correct
Your iniquities have become a separation Between you and your God And your sins have hidden His face From you so that He does not hear
God will not answer prayers that ask inappropriately, that is, asking evilly that we may receive for the sake of our pleasures
According to the Lord's word, if a brother has something against us, we must first be reconciled to him in order to clear up the problem
Faith honors and glorifies God; doubts despise and humiliate God, making it impossible for Him to answer our prayers
If a husband and a wife do not live in this way, if there is a problem or separation, their prayer will be hindered
Any friction, quarrel, or discord between husband and wife makes it difficult for prayers to be heard and answered by God
If we have the economic means to care for a brother's lack but close our heart of mercy, how can God hear our prayers and cries?
We must deal with our stingy heart according to God's pleasure so that our prayers can be heard and answered by God
If we do not listen to the word of God's command, or if we hate the word of God's command, He will not hear our prayer to Him
Whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight'
When we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight, we receive what we ask from Him
If we do not keep His commandments or do the things that are pleasing in His sight, we will not receive what we ask from Him
If we are not willing to do what is pleasing in His sight, God will not be willing to accomplish the things that we ask
Not keeping God's commandments or not doing the things that are pleasing in His sight prevents our prayers from being answered by God
Elisha became angry with him and said that he should have struck the ground five or six times in order to completely defeat his enemy
Sometimes our prayers do not receive a complete answer from God because we are not burning enough and do not pray enough
We should ask God to forgive us of our sins, especially our secret faults which have not even been exposed to us
We should frequently pray for God to search us, to know our heart, and to try us and know our anxious thoughts
We should ask Him to see what evil is within us, what idolatrous way is there, and to lead us in the eternal way
Perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ'
We also need to pray for the kingdom of God and His work, for the church and the saints, for all men, and for Israel, and so forth
We should ask the Lord to open a door for His word so that His word may run and be glorified in order to spread His kingdom
Petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men; on behalf of kings and all who are in high position'
We should also pray for those who are in high positions in the government, asking God to bless them and give peace
When God created man, He saw that it was not good for man to be alone, so He determined to make a helper for man as his counterpart
He created man so that a male and a female would need each other in order to be a complete person by becoming one flesh
In the New Testament the Lord's consideration of the importance of human marriage matched God's consideration in creation
Demons have a desire to destroy the accomplishment of God's goal which depends upon human marriage, so they forbid people to marry
Since marriage is according to God's ordination and should be honored by man, no one should consider a proper marriage as sinful
A person who does not have a willingness to not marry or who feels forced in the matter of not marrying has not received this gift from God
It is better for one to follow God's ordination and his natural need to be married than to be forced to not marry
Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit
Then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better'
The apostle's word in these verses refers to the matter of some believers keeping their virginity, and it is very clear and definite
The Bible does not have a hard rule concerning this matter; instead, it gives us the authority to choose freely
Since oxen and donkeys have different dispositions and inclinations, they have difficulty walking together on the same road
According to the pattern in Genesis 24, if older ones like Abraham can oversee and confirm our choice, our choice will be more solid
A good wife and an appropriate spouse is a gift from God ; consequently, we may not be able to choose well by ourselves
At this time he thought it best if widows do not remarry but remain single as he was in order to concentrate on serving the Lord
He must have observed that it was difficult for young widows, who could be easily tempted by Satan, to remain single
At that time he wanted younger widows to marry, bear children, and keep house to give no opportunity for Satan to tempt them
Younger widows were to be refused because the church could not know whether she would remain single as a widow in need of assistance
If he divorces his wife and marries another for any matter other than adultery, he breaks the oneness of marriage and commits adultery
Whenever we see a marriage, we should be reminded of our relationship to Christ and of Christ's relationship to us
For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh'
The condition of the producing and building up of the family primarily depends on the condition of the union between a husband and his wife
Ephesians 5:22 speaks of this matter, because a wife often agrees with another sister's husband but is not subject to her own husband
Should remember the person whom God has ordained as their authority and be subject to their own husband not another sisters husband
When a wife becomes the head and asserts authority over a man, it is as if heaven and earth have been turned upside down
It is a protection and a blessing for a woman to maintain her position of subjection with a man's authority covering her head
Although the husband is the head, God does not command him to assert authority over his wife; rather, He wants him to love his wife
According to knowledge means according to reason, according to facts and principles, not according to emotions and reactions
When some brothers deal with their wives, they are completely unreasonable; that is, they consider only their own preferences
In God's eyes a husband and wife are one person, and in His salvation a husband and wife are heirs together of the grace of life
Husbands should be sympathetic to their wives' weaknesses on the one hand and assign honor to their wives on the other hand
Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again'
A husband and a wife being one flesh are a symbol of a great mystery Christ and the church and of the oneness between Christ and the church
Whenever we consider a husband and wife being one flesh, we should see the mystery of the oneness of Christ and the church
The apostle says that this is the first commandment with a promise: If we honor our parents, it will be well with us, and we will live long
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord'
The Bible teaches that the most important matter for fathers in dealing with their children is not to provoke them to anger
It is not right for him to care merely for his children's happiness, neglecting the discipline and admonition of the Lord
The secret of being a father is for him to care for his childrens happiness and to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord
Know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things'
Human fathers know how to give good gifts to their children just as God the Father gives good gifts to us His children
Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ'
In our households there might be a relationship between master and servants, so the Bible has a specific teaching regarding this matter
Those who have believing masters should not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather they should serve them'
We symbolize Him as the Master, so we cannot make mistakes with regard to our servants lest we symbolize, or manifest, Him incorrectly
If anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever'
Shepherding involves cooperating with nature to produce things from animals that are beneficial to us and others
According to the Bible, Christians can have additional skills other than producing necessities for human living
Although physicians do not produce necessities for human living, they provide a necessary skill to benefit humans
According to the principle of a skill, occupations involving teaching, nursing, or laboring are beneficial to man
Believers may not form business partnerships with unbelievers because God's Word says that believers should not be dissimilarly yoked
When believers have a job or a business, they should not hoard their money but should share with brothers and sisters who have need
Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have?
We are righteousness, light, of Christ, and the temple of God; unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, of Satan, and idol-worshippers
We should not have fellowship with them so that we can have fellowship with God and become sons and daughters who are pleasing to God
While we cannot be friends with unbelievers, we must be careful and not make friends loosely even with a believer
If we make friends loosely without discernment it will be difficult to avoid evil influences thus we can corrupt ourselves and suffer loss
In Genesis 18 Abraham entertained God just as a friend would receive another friend, especially when he walked with God to send Him away
While meat symbolizes redemption through the shedding of blood, vegetables symbolize works without the shedding of blood
After the fall and the entrance of sin , man needs the shedding of blood for redemption in order to live before God
Those who are tricked by Satan into being vegetarians not only practice self-denial but also rely on self-denial
When the Lord Jesus came, He told us to drink His blood because only His blood redeems us and enables us to obtain His life
Birds that do not eat dead meat but rather seeds of life represent people who touch matters of life rather than matters of death
Abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth'
Everything created by God is good and can be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth
If we partake with thanksgiving, nothing need be refused, because it is sanctified through the Word of God and intercession
Everything that God originally created lost its position of belonging to God and being for His use because of the fall
They are sanctified through the Word of God by our thanksgiving and intercession, and they have been brought back to God for His use
Spiritually speaking, we should eat only His blood, which is symbolized by not eating things which are strangled and blood
You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the demons' cup; you cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the demons' table'
If some are weak in the faith and think that something is unclean, it is unclean to them, and they should not eat it
Those who live in the kingdom of God today should not emphasize the matter of eating but should emphasize the matter of spiritual life
Although there is no law today concerning what we can eat, our eating and drinking should be to the glory of God
Every time we eat physical food and our body gains nourishment, we should be reminded of how our spirit needs the word of God to nourish it
Although he used leaves of a tree to make loincloths to cover his shame, these leaves could not cover the shame
Sinful man always tries to cover his shame with his own actions and behavior, but such a covering is not possible through human actions
Clothes that expose the chest, shoulders, feet, and legs do not correspond to God's desire for man to be covered
In the dispensation of the law God continued to tell man to wear clothing in order to cover his shame and to not expose his body
God did not allow the Israelites to use steps to go up to His altar so that the nakedness of their lower body would not be exposed
God did not allow the women among His people, the Israelites, to wear men's clothing or the men to wear women's clothing
In the dispensation of the law God did not allow the children of Israel to wear clothing made of different materials, such as wool and linen
In the Old Testament God told the Israelites to attach a fringe to the borders of their clothing and to put a cord of blue on the fringe
A cord of blue on the fringe of their garment surrounded their legs and signified that their steps were under the heavenly limitation
The garments that God ordered the priests to wear in Exodus 28 were completely different from the clothing of the people of Israel
These verses are specifically directed toward the sisters because they pay more attention to matters of adornment
Regardless of where we are or what we are doing, we have an inward sense of whether or not our clothing is proper
When Jacob and his family were going to Bethel to worship God, they took off their earrings and put away their idols
If we want the Lord's leading, we must take all the ornaments off of our body just as the children of Israel did
Isaiah 3 says that the city of Zion was punished because the daughters of Zion were haughty in their adornment
We should not dress in rumpled clothing or neglect to brush our hair in order to obtain spiritual praise by appearing to be fasting
According to the Lords word through the apostle a brother should not cover his head when he prays or speaks that is he should not wear a hat
May the Lord save the sisters from fashions that are contrary to His will, and may their hair grow according to His will
When we see a man with long hair, we feel uncomfortable, and when we see a woman with very short hair, we feel equally uncomfortable
The garment of salvation is the robe of righteousness, and the robe of righteousness is the garment of salvation
Food symbolizes Christ as our inward supply for our life, and clothing symbolizes Christ as our outward righteousness to cover our shame
Alas, many brothers and sisters who have received Christ as their righteousness follow the fashions of Satan that expose much of their body
In the matter of their clothing, they do not properly manifest their need for and their gaining of Christ as their righteousness
May He also show us that Satan can use both food and clothing to manifest contrary, hidden, and negative symbols
May the Lord save us from Satan's hidden, contrary, and negative purposes so that we may match His positive intentions
The second kind is the righteousness that relates to our acts through the Holy Spirit, which makes us acceptable before Christ
If we have Christ only as our righteousness but not the righteousnesses through the Holy Spirit, we will be saved, but we will not overcome
These righteousnesses come out of our living in the Holy Spirit by the life of Christ, that is, by Christ Himself
The garment that we should have before Christ is the righteousnesses that come out of our living the life of Christ through the Holy Spirit
Its nature before God is completely incompatible with every aspect of God, so in God's eyes its very nature is unrighteousness
If we want to guard ourselves from covetousness, we should not be like the foolish rich man who depended on money, not on God
God, who feeds the birds of the air and arrays the lilies in the field, regards us as more important than these birds and flowers
If this is our basic attitude, we will not covet when we do not have money, and we will not hold on to money when we have it
Be ready to distribute, to be ones willing to share; laying away for themselves a good foundation as a treasure for the future'
We should take advantage of today, while money is still useful, to do our best to make friends by means of our money
In the future, when money fails, those whom we have helped with our money will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles
When we are saved and return to God's house, the Father will welcome us according to the Lord's word in Luke 15
In the Lord's eyes our faithfulness in the matter of making friends with the mammon of unrighteousness is the least of things
In such cases those who fear God cannot obey their command and offend God, even though they should be subject to the authority from God
All the authorities over us are ordained by God; therefore, believers should be subject to them, rendering fear and honor
