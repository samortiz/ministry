<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES CONCERNING<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ORGANIZATION WITHOUT LIFE<br />
BEING A GREAT MISTAKE</h2>
<p>There is organization in the church, but this organization must be according to the life of God. When we speak of coordination and service in the church, we cannot avoid using the term <em>organization.</em> In every local church there is an order, an arrangement, related to the elders, deacons, and serving ones. This obviously involves organization; we cannot deny this. However, we must pay attention to the fact that this organization must have life as its content. To have organization without life is a great mistake.</p>
<p>We are reluctant to use the term <em>organization</em> in order to avoid causing the church to fall into a state in which there is only organization but not the inner life. Christianity has been in error for two thousand years because it has many different organizations that are contrary to biblical principles. These organizations limit the freedom of the Holy Spirit and greatly contradict the work of the Holy Spirit. For this reason, many godly people condemn the matter of organization. On our part, although the word <em>organization</em> has negative connotations, we do not categorically refuse to use it. Nevertheless, when we use this term, we must be careful to avoid the error of organization in its unscriptural sense, a sense that limits and contradicts the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO SERVE PROPERLY<br />
ALWAYS HAVING THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>When a person is serving, he will have a sense within. If his service is of life, he will sense the anointing and the supply of life while serving. The more he serves and works in the church business office, the more he will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Likewise, the more he records the information of the saints, cleans, and carries out other chores, the more he will touch the Lord and receive the supply of life. In this way, he knows that his serving is right.</p>
<p>Sometimes when a brother speaks in a meeting of the church, the more he speaks, the more supply people receive, and the more he himself is inwardly satisfied. This proves that his speaking is not merely an outward arrangement in the way of organization but that it is the result of growth in the inner life. Such speaking will have impact upon the listeners. A brother may preach the gospel and speak of how the Lord Jesus died on the cross to bear man&rsquo;s sins; nevertheless, no one may be touched. Another brother may also preach concerning the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross to bear man&rsquo;s sins; however, his speaking may touch those who are listening. Although he may speak only a few sentences, the listeners will immediately sense that they are sinners. As a result, they will repent and receive the Lord Jesus. If we want our speaking to touch and convict people, we must have the experience of repentance and confession. If we experience repentance and confession, we will speak from experience when we give a message concerning the Lord Jesus bearing our sins. This will touch and convict people, causing them to touch life inwardly.</p>
<p>The best test of whether or not our service is according to life is our inner sense. Wherever we serve and whatever our service is, the best test is our inner sense. The more we serve, the more we should touch life, and the more we should experience the anointing; however, if the more we serve, the drier we become, we should stop our service and come back to the Lord to deal with our situation carefully. If those whom we visit do not reap the issue of life, and if those who listen to our speaking do not receive the supply of life, whether we are elders, deacons, or teachers, we should be clear inwardly that our position is wrong. In other words, our service is purely organizational. It is not the outgrowth of life. If this is the case, we need to seriously repent before the Lord in order to see where we have gone wrong in regard to life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SAMUEL&rsquo;S ANOINTING OF DAVID BEING<br />
THE BEST EXAMPLE OF<br />
A PROPER APPOINTING OF ELDERS</h2>
<p>When the responsible brothers are arranging the services in the church, such as assigning a brother to be responsible in a district, a sister to be a deaconess, or a saint to be responsible for a specific service, they must be serious before the Lord and say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, the authority is in Your hand. We do not have our own opinion. We want to touch Your feeling and act according to Your will.&rdquo; If they hold their own opinions and decisions and do not touch the Lord&rsquo;s feeling in making arrangements, this means that the Lord does not have authority over them. In other words, they may think that a certain one should take care of a particular service; however, when they are quietly in the presence of the Lord, they may have a feeling that the Lord disagrees with and rejects their consideration. Even though they approve, the Lord within disapproves. At this time, they should yield the authority to the Lord. On the surface, it is a group of responsible brothers who make the arrangement, but actually, it is the Lord who holds the authority.</p>
<p>When the co-workers appoint elders, they must be able to say from a pure conscience and a calm spirit, &ldquo;We sense that this is the Lord&rsquo;s feeling. This is not our concept, our opinion, or our preference. It is not because we love these ones that we want them to be elders. Rather, we have considered and prayed before the Lord, and we have sought, waited, and looked to the Lord. We have sought to touch the Lord&rsquo;s feeling regarding every brother.&rdquo; This is what happened when Samuel anointed David. The decision did not depend upon what Samuel thought of David; rather, Samuel listened to Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking. It was not Samuel who held the authority in his hand but Jehovah. Samuel was simply a prophet of Jehovah. He was a man sent by Jehovah to be Jehovah&rsquo;s messenger. The authority was not in Samuel&rsquo;s hand. This is the basic principle in regard to co-workers&rsquo; appointing of elders.</p>
<p>Samuel&rsquo;s anointing of David is the best example (1 Sam. 16:1-13). In this kind of appointing, God is allowed to speak; that is, He is allowed to have the authority. God never turned over this authority to any apostle. We should never think that if we are an apostle, we have the authority in ourselves to appoint elders. It is wrong to think this way. God never gives such authority to man. He always keeps authority in His hand. We have to fear God to the extent that we see that we are simply slaves. Authority is not in our hand. We are not the Lord. He is the Lord. In the church of God no brother or sister or group of saints should be so presumptuous as to usurp the Lord&rsquo;s authority. We need to have a God-fearing heart. Whenever we assign someone to serve, inwardly we need to bow down and worship, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Head of the church, and You are our Lord. Although You have entrusted us with the responsibility of making this assignment, the authority is in Your hand. Lord, we make this decision in Your name. What we say does not count. Only what You say counts. Lord, our discernment is not accurate. Yours is accurate.&rdquo; This is what it means to bear authority.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
