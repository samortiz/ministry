   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Inheriting the Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennium Matt 19:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with a fuller enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens Luke 18:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some believers have received eternal life and enjoy eternal life to a certain extent; however, they have not enjoyed it to the proper level.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result, when the Lord Jesus comes back and the kingdom is manifested, they will lose the fuller enjoyment of the eternal life in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the overcomers will participate in the coming kingdom, inheriting eternal life and having a fuller enjoyment of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, they will be the first to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will be their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having Their Names Remain</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in the Book of Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the millennium the names of the overcomers will remain in the book of life Rev 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book Luke 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These blessings are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, and the divine nature, are all the initial portions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All God s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they mature in life in the church age, this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize to be rewarded to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, those who do not mature in life in the church age will not be able to enter into the millennial kingdom at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, their names will be written in the book of life again so that they may share in the blessing of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in the coming kingdom age only the names of those believers who live an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not Being Hurt by the Second Death</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennial kingdom, they will not be hurt by the second death Rev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once Heb 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This first death, however, is not the final settlement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the close of the millennium, that is, at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth, all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment of the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result of this judgment, they will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the overcomers will have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death, they will require no further dealing by God after their resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They will be resurrected before the millennium to be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that they will not be hurt by the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eating of the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>in the Paradise of God the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The overcomers will eat of the fruit of the tree of life in the paradise of God the New Jerusalem 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will be the common portion of all God s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a dispensational reward given only to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>H. Shining Forth like the Sun</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The overcomers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 13:43 says, The righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Daniel 12:3 also speaks of the same thing: Those who have insight will shine like the shining of the heavenly expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars, forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The righteous, who shine forth like the sun, are the sons of the kingdom Matt 13:38, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Matthew 5:20 these sons of the kingdom will have the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will be righteous to such an extent that their entire being will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the believers shine like a lamp vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>14-16 , but in the coming millennial kingdom the overcomers will not only enjoy the Father as the light but will also shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
