<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>x. Diotrephes Loving to Be First in the Church<br>and Not Receiving the Apostles</H2><P>Diotrephes, who was very ambitious, loved to be first in the church and did not receive the apostles (3 John 9-10). This shows how serious the chaos had become.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>y. Some Going in the Way of Cain,<br>Rushing Out in the Error of Balaam for Reward,<br>and Perishing in the Rebellion of Korah</H2><P>Some went in the way of Cain, rushed out in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah (Jude 11-13). The stories concerning Cain, Balaam, and Korah were repeated in the church life, and this repetition brought chaos into the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>z. The Situation of the First, Third, Fourth,<br>Fifth, and Seventh of the Seven Churches in Asia</H2><P>Among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the first one lost her first love toward the Lord (2:4); the third one fell into the world where Satan's throne is, held the teaching of Balaam involved with idolatry and fornication, and held also the teaching of the Nicolaitans related to hierarchy (2:13-15); the fourth one had the teaching of Jezebel involved with fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan (2:20, 24a); the fifth one was living in name, yet she was dead, with nothing perfect before God (3:1-2); and the last one, in Laodicea, was lukewarm, boasting in her "riches," but not realizing her wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked condition, with the Lord Christ standing outside and knocking at her door (3:14-17, 20).</P><P>Thus far in this message we have covered almost the entire New Testament regarding the divine economy and the satanic chaos. We have seen that the ministry both of the Lord Jesus and of the apostles was accompanied by chaos. No other apostle suffered as much as Paul did. He suffered persecution from the Jewish religion and also from the Roman government. Wherever he went chaos was waiting for him. The last time he went to Jerusalem was for the interest of the church there; he was deeply concerned about the Judaic situation in the church in Jerusalem. After he arrived, he followed the advice of James and the elders to offer sacrifices in the temple. We have pointed out that the Lord did not allow him to complete the ceremony. There was turmoil, and that caused Paul to be put into prison. Although that ended his traveling ministry, it did not end his writing ministry. On the contrary, his writing ministry became higher, deeper, and richer, and the epistles written from prison have been a great benefit to the believers throughout the centuries. Eventually the chaos that went along with Paul's ministry benefited the church.</P><P>The principle is the same with the recent turmoil among us in the Lord's recovery. This chaos has helped the recovery and has stabilized the recovery in this country. Through this turmoil many have been tested, stabilized, and established.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE ENDING OF THE SATANIC CHAOS<br>AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><P>Now I would like to give a concluding word regarding the ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P>
