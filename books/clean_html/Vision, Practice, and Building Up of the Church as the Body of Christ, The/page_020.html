<h2 class="head3">Our Inner Man Needing to Be Strengthened</h2>
<p>Verses 14-15 begin, &ldquo;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named.&rdquo; <em>For this cause</em> refers to God&rsquo;s plan mentioned in the previous chapters and verses, including our predestination unto sonship, the riches of Christ being ministered to us, Christ heading up all things, making the multifarious wisdom of God known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, putting the enemy to shame, and other matters. Verse 16 continues, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; The inner man is our human spirit, regenerated by the Spirit and indwelt by Christ. This spirit needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Man is tripartite, having a spirit, soul, and body, but of these three parts the soul is often the strongest. The soul itself is a composition of the mind, emotion, and will, and of these three parts the mind is the strongest. Our biggest problem is that we are too strong in our mind, while our spirit is very weak. We can prove this in the following way. Every kind of person likes to talk. If we say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some time to talk,&rdquo; our mind will be active, strong, and positive. However, when we say, &ldquo;Let us have a time of prayer,&rdquo; everyone is silent. Right away the room may become like a cemetery; everyone will be &ldquo;grieving at the tomb,&rdquo; silent and in order. This is our case because we are too weak in our inner man, our spirit. This is why the writer of Ephesians says that he prayed not in a light way but by bowing his knees, for the cause of the church as God&rsquo;s purpose, that the Father in the universe would grant us to be strengthened into the inner man.</p>
<p>Our spirit needs to be strengthened. There is no need for us to discuss, talk, or argue. The more we talk and argue, the more we exercise our mind. Our mind has been over-exercised and over-developed, but we still try to develop it even more. When a part of our body over-develops, it becomes a cancer that brings death. We need to forget this natural mind which has been taken over by the enemy. It is more profitable to change our discussion into prayer. Let us be humble to forget our thoughts, imagination, understanding, and concepts, and let us bow our knees before the Father and pray to exercise our spirit, not only once but constantly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Our Heart Needing to Be Opened<br />
by the Repenting of Our Mind<br />
and the Exercise of Our Conscience</h2>
<p>In order to exercise our spirit to pray, we need to repent. <em>Repent</em> in Greek means to turn the mind. To repent is to turn our mind to the Lord and have a change of mind. Our mind must be turned from everything other than the Lord back to the Lord. When we turn our mind to the Lord, our conscience shows us how we are wrong with the Lord, so we need to confess. To repent is to turn the mind, and to confess is to exercise the conscience. The mind and the conscience are the two main parts of the heart, and the heart surrounds our spirit. Therefore, the heart is a gateway to our spirit. Through our repenting and confessing, the two main parts of our heart&mdash;our mind and our conscience&mdash;spontaneously are opened. Then when the gateway is opened, the spirit is free, so the Lord is able to strengthen our spirit and spread into our heart.</p>
<p>Verse 17a says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; The heart is a composition of the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. When our mind is set on other things, our conscience is hardened, our emotions are not for Him, and Christ is imprisoned in our spirit. Therefore, we must repent, turn our mind to the Lord, recognize our sinfulness, and confess our failures. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, and I am for You.&rdquo; In this way our whole heart is exercised and open, so our spirit is wholly free. Then Christ will fill and strengthen our spirit, and spontaneously He will spread from our spirit into our heart to make His home in all the parts of our heart. This means that our whole being will be a dwelling place for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Apprehending the Unlimited Dimensions of Christ by Being Built Up with All the Saints</h2>
<p>Verses 17b-18 continue, &ldquo;That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&rdquo; That we are rooted indicates that we are plants, and our being grounded means that we are a building. Together these two aspects mean that we need to grow and be built up.</p>
<p>We are able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth not by ourselves individually but corporately and jointly. This means that we must be built together. We can never be built up together by doctrinal knowledge. The more knowledge we have, the more fighting and divisions we will have. As Christ makes His home in us, we will forget about mere knowledge, fighting, and divisions. Rather, we will say, &ldquo;O Lord, be merciful to me! I am filled with knowledge and I may have the gifts, but I am short of apprehending You with all the saints.&rdquo; It is when Christ makes His home in our hearts, occupying and taking over every inward part of our being, that we are able to apprehend the unlimited Christ with all the saints. This means that we are able to be built together with all the saints, that we are no more individual but rather corporate. In this way we realize that Christ is immeasurable and without limit. No one can tell what the measure of the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are. These are the dimensions of Christ. Christ is the length, the breadth, the height, the depth. He is immeasurable and unlimited. Together with all the saints we will realize the unsearchable riches of Christ in the spirit.</p>
