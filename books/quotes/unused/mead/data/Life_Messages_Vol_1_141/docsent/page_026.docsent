   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EFFECTS OF RECEIVING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you really touch the Word, you will find life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You will know there is life in the Word because you will be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in small things the light will shine brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You will have no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever you come to the Word, you should experience this light searching and exposing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not, you must pray, "Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why do I not sense the light?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Take away the dullness, the numbness, the blindness, and the veils, that I may sense Your light."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides being enlightened, you will experience being nourished and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Word first comes as light, then as nourishment and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually it does a killing work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the light exposes and the nourishment strengthens, you will say, "Lord, I am willing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take this away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Cut it off."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In receiving the Word, you will find it does much killing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will kill your natural concepts about your husband or wife, about the brothers and sisters, about the church and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It will kill your carnal desires and fleshly lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You will find yourself praying, "Lord, kill my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Kill my natural humility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Kill my performed meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Kill my hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Kill my politics with the brothers and with my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you build up the habit of getting into the Word, you will have this experience daily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually you will find this Christ so close and so precious to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You will begin to breathe Him and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By taking the Word in this way, you will live Him, grow Him, and produce Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will have the soil of your heart cultivated by the Father to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will cultivate the soil of your conscience, which is the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will cultivate also the soil of your emotion, your will, and your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will make a way for the vine to spread into every part of your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you will all go to the Word in this way over a period of time, the outcome will be a genuine revival in the church life, brought about from within, without any stirring up, promotion, or performance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what the Lord's recovery needs today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not correct or adjust yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just come back to the Word and to abiding in the vine by abiding in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When it says in John 15:7, "My words abide in you," in Greek "words" is rhema, the present, instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We digest the logos, and it becomes the rhema to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we get the enlightening, the nourishing, the strengthening, the killing, and the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>HOW TO TOUCH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever our condition weak, backsliding, or wrong thank God we do have these two legacies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit and the Word are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As you read, the Holy Spirit cooperates with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In contrast, if you try to exercise the spirit in reading the Los Angeles Times, there will be no inward response.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But every time you come to the Bible, in the name and under the blood, something inside works in coordination with what you are reading outside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is the corresponding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Obedience is the only way to touch the corresponding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may be weak, but you cannot deny that the dear Spirit of our God is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may grieve Him, but He will never leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why, whenever you have a heart to come to the Lord in His name and under His blood, the Spirit within will echo what you read in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the more you say amen to this speaking, the more the responding Spirit will work within you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will be either rebuked to the depths of your being or rejoicing in the heights.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You will never be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD WORKING WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With the Word occupying and saturating your mind and the Spirit dwelling in your spirit, you will live, grow, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will have the fragrance of Christ, which others will sense without any advertising.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How does this come about?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By receiving the Word into your being time after time, the Spirit has wrought Himself, even Christ, into you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your mind will be possessed by the Word and your spirit permeated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path Psa 119:105 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Word that occupies your mind will shine before your feet, lighting your way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You will not be walking in darkness because the mind-occupying Word will shine over your steps.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the same time the indwelling Spirit will keep speaking to you, comforting and nourishing you all day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is like the food we take in; we may finish a meal in thirty minutes, but for several hours afterward that food sustains us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May we take Christ as our food through His Word and drink Him as our water through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus we shall live, grow, and produce Him, fulfilling the Father's desire.</S>
