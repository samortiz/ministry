   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Why did our Lord not descend from heaven as a grown-up?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did He have to come through a virgin's womb?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did He have to be nursed, nurtured, and grow gradually?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did He have to pass through thirty-three years of suffering on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why was He not crucified three days after He was born on the earth to accomplish His work of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh, the reason He was willing to submit to all kinds of limitation and suffer every affliction was that He wanted to sympathize with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He learned the principles of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was misunderstood and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was stripped, mistreated, and forsaken by people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He endured all these sufferings in order to experience the bitter taste of human life and sympathize with man's weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His thirty-three years of human living and His preaching during the three years were not only to accomplish His mission and work, but also for the sake of sympathizing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had to do this before He could sympathize with our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is a broken or wounded heart here today, the Lord is right now feeling what you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knows your afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only does He have the grace to save you, but He has a heart that sympathizes with you and feels your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to sympathize with others, experience is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second thing one needs is love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people suffer illness for many years; they are sick every three days and rest every two days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have tasted the bitterness of their illness, but they still cannot sympathize with the sick patients in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They can only sympathize with those they love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have the experience, but they do not necessarily have love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, they cannot sympathize with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was able to sympathize with everyone while He was on the earth because He not only had the experience, but He also had the love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once when the Lord came down from a mountain, a leper worshipped Him and said, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Immediately, the Lord touched him with His hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matt 8:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was a place in His heart for the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could feel the suffering of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, He touched him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord did not merely have the experience; He also had a heart full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Experience and love alone are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third thing you need is to not be occupied with your own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that nothing occupies you beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times a man's heart is occupied with something already; therefore, his heart is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, he cannot sympathize with others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He may say, "I cannot even bear my own burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can I sympathize with others?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord was on the earth, He bore a particular characteristic: He put aside His own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What our Lord did not do is more marvelous and meaningful than what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He was hungry, He did not turn the stones into bread.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was taken by the enemy, He did not ask the Father to protect Him with twelve legions of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His heart was not occupied with His own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was never preoccupied with His own affairs so that He could not sympathize with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times when we have our own burdens and sufferings, we have no heart for the sufferings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this was not the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He had been only concerned with the suffering He was about to experience on the cross, He would have been occupied with His own suffering every day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would not have been able to sympathize with others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If He had thought all the time about His suffering how it was the greatest and hardest of all sufferings He would not have been able to care for and help others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Lord lived as if nothing was going to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When He met the sick, He healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He met the poor, He preached the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He acted as if nothing was going to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was fully sympathetic towards others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time He sympathized with others, His heart was like a piece of clean paper on which any letter or drawing could be inscribed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise and thank the Lord that His heart was empty and wholly reserved for others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He not only sympathized with the people of that time, He also sympathizes with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is our High Priest, and today He sympathizes with us in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What He experienced was a thousand times harder than what we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can trust in Him and pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever difficulty we have, He joins Himself to our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is gracious to us, and He helps us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will bring us peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hebrews 4:16 says, "Come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times we feel that others do not consider our problems to be important and that no one can sympathize with us, comfort us, or help us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At these times, we surely feel how heavy our burden is and how much our suffering is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But there is One in heaven who sympathizes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can come boldly to the throne of grace to beseech Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In heaven, there is One who sympathizes with us and has mercy on us; He feels our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He will make our burden light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At times, friends on earth may lighten our burden, but this Friend in heaven is always ready to bear our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He not only bears our burden in feeling, but in reality as well.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He sympathizes with us, and He is gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is as though we are the only ones He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is only concerned about our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is such a Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have such a Lord!</S>
