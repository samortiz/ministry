<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT—THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:10, 13, 16-20, 23, 26; 20:22; 15:26; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1><p>Bible readers all know that the Bible speaks of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit is one of the three major subjects of the Bible. Throughout the centuries Bible readers have studied a great deal about Christ. However, they have not been thorough enough, and might even be considered negligent, in their study of the Holy Spirit in the biblical record. In this message we want to see the Holy Spirit, “the Spirit,” from the viewpoint of the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of God</h2><p>At the very beginning, in Genesis 1, after telling us that God created the heavens and the earth, the Bible goes on to say that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters (v. 2, ASV). The Hebrew word for moved means something like the brooding of a hen over its eggs. A hen broods, stretching its wings over its eggs for the purpose of producing something living, that is, its chicks. Therefore, some good English versions of the Bible have translated this word into was brooding, with the sense of life-producing. Bible readers all know that Genesis 1 speaks about God’s creation of the heavens and the earth, but many have neglected the fact that God’s act of creation was performed by the Spirit of God, that is, carried out by the Spirit of God brooding over the face of the waters.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Jehovah</h2><p>After speaking of the Spirit of God, the Old Testament refers to the Spirit of Jehovah numerous times. The Spirit of Jehovah indicates the reaching of God to man. The book of Judges frequently says that certain judges rose up to fight for the children of Israel because the Spirit of Jehovah had come upon them (3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6). Furthermore, the prophets rose up to speak for God because the Spirit of Jehovah had come upon them also (2 Sam. 23:2; Isa. 61:1). Elijah became a prophet because the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him; later, Elisha, following Elijah, put on Elijah’s mantle. That mantle is a type of the Holy Spirit descending upon the believers in the New Testament as the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, “And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.” This is what the mantle of Elijah and Elisha typifies. Hence, this Spirit is also called “the mantle Spirit.”<p>In Joel 2:28-29 God promised, saying, “And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh,/…Indeed even upon the servants and the maids / In those days I will pour out My Spirit.” In the Old Testament the pouring out of the Spirit is typified by rain, as in Hosea 6:3, which says that God would pour out His Spirit at two times as the fulfillment of the autumn, or former, rain and the spring, or latter, rain. On the day of Pentecost, the pouring out of the Spirit was the former rain; at the end of this age, God will again pour out His Spirit upon the children of Israel, and all Israel will repent and be saved. This is the latter rain, as prophesied in Zechariah 12:10. The Old Testament speaks of the Spirit of God only to this extent, concluding at the end with a promise, which is that God will pour out His Spirit as rain upon His elect.<h2 class=head2>The Holy Spirit</h2><p>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God. Matthew chapter one says that the Holy Spirit entered into the womb of Mary, a human virgin, causing her to conceive and give birth to a child, Christ. At the time of the New Testament, for the initiation of the gospel of God, the preparing of a human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God’s plan of redemption. Hence, the mention of the Holy Spirit in the beginning of the New Testament is related to the conception of Christ.
