   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Law Do Not Resist</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 39 the Lord says, But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new law is not to resist one who is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the Lord said that when someone strikes our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To do this indicates that there is no resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 40 says, And to him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If someone claims your tunic, a shirt-like undergarment, give him your cloak also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will prove that you have no resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 41 the Lord says, And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To turn the other cheek to the striker, to let the one who sues have the cloak, and to go with the compeller the second mile prove that the kingdom people have the power to suffer and to be meek instead of resisting and to walk not in the flesh, nor in the soul for their own interest, but in the spirit for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose someone comes to you and wants your shirt, and you give him your jacket also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps you can afford to give him ten jackets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue here is not whether your financial status allows you to give him your jacket; it is whether your temper allows you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If someone demands your shirt, your anger may be aroused.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, it is not a matter of a shirt or a jacket, but of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the same in principle with being struck on the right cheek or compelled to walk a mile.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To resist by claiming an eye for an eye means that you are releasing your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the Lord is saying that we cannot satisfy our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of releasing the gopher of our temper, we must kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not deal with the one making a claim upon you; deal with your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The problem is not your opponent; it is your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord allows someone to claim your tunic as a test to expose where you are, to prove that the gopher of your temper is still lurking within you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are a spiritual people, even the kingdom people, but our temper is still hidden within us and needs to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who make claims of you expose this little gopher.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If someone demands your tunic, you may say, I don t owe you anything!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why do you come to me?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not blame the one making a claim the Lord has sent him but kill the gopher of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of displaying anger, say to him, Since you want my undershirt, I will give you my jacket also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This proves that your temper has been killed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the kingdom people should be able to say, No matter how many unjust claims you place on me, my anger is not stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I still love you and I am willing to share with you all I have.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want my shirt, I shall gladly give you my jacket also.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The attitude of the kingdom people should always be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I say again, the issue here is not one of money, but of our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the matters mentioned in verses 39 through 41 touch our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Millionaires can afford to give thousands of dollars away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they often display their temper with a taxi driver over a mere twenty-five cents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The money does not mean anything; it is a matter of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We, the kingdom people, must be above our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 42 the Lord says, To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To give and not turn away from the borrower proves that the kingdom people do not care for material riches and are not possessed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the real issue is not material wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Giving to those who ask or who want to borrow touches our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is not saying that we should lack discernment and behave in a foolish way regarding material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is telling us that we must be above both material things and our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never be stirred in our temper by this kind of thing nor touched by the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the overcoming attitude of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that we are overly generous or careless in managing money.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although you may be very careful in the way you spend money, you will be above material possessions and above your temper when such a time comes as described in verse 42.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No claim will stir up your anger.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The old law did not touch people s anger or their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the new law, the changed law, touches both our temper and our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I. Regarding Enemies 1.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Old Law Love Your Neighbor</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>and Hate Your Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we come to the last law changed by the Lord, the law regarding the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 43 says, You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Legally speaking, the old law is fair and righteous; for a good neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, to love a neighbor and to hate an enemy is right and fair.</S>
