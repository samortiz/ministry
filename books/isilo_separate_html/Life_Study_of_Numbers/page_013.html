The Tent of Meeting with the Camp<br>of the Levites, Which Was to Set Out<br>in the Middle, Being in the Midst of the Camps</H2><P>In the midst of the camps was the tent of meeting, with the camp of the Levites, which was to set out in the middle of the four camps (Num. 2:17). The Levites were encamped around the tabernacle on three sides: on the west the Gershonites (3:23), on the south the Kohathites (3:29), and on the north the sons of Merari (3:35), leaving the east side for Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's two sons (3:38).</P><P>The more we consider the picture of the children of Israel encamping in array around the tabernacle, the more we must adore God for His plan, His sovereignty, and His creating ability. By God's creating ability, Jacob had twelve sons, each of whom became a tribe. One tribe, Levi, was set aside to become the priests (Levites), but Joseph's two sons filled the gap. Levi begot three sons, who occupied three sides of the tabernacle, leaving one side for Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's sons.</P><P>These details are not presented as clearly in the New Testament as they are in the Old Testament. This is why we need the pictures in the Old Testament. Although there are many pictures in the Old Testament, few Christians know how to apply them to what is recorded in the New Testament. If we read Revelation 21 and 22 carefully, we will find in these chapters certain reminders referring us to the Old Testament. Without the pictures in the Old Testament, it is difficult to understand the revelation concerning the New Jerusalem given in the New Testament.</P><P>We need to look into these matters in Numbers, not for others but for ourselves, considering our situation today. We should seek the Lord's mercy and ask Him, "Lord, am I a wheat or a tare? Lord, is there leaven within me?" The Lord may answer from within our spirit by exposing our idle words, our criticizing, gossiping, vain talking, and backbiting, all of which are leaven. Then we also need to ask the Lord, "Lord, is my work still related in some way to the big tree?" He may say, "Yes, you like to have a facade, to make a display of what you have done." We should also ask the Lord whether we have gold, pearls, and precious stones. He may reply that we do have some gold and also some of the element of pearls and precious stones, but the amount and the brightness are quite deficient. Since this is our situation, what should we do? We should humble ourselves before the Lord and receive His dealings.</P><P>In order to read the book of Numbers properly, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to open His word. Then we will be enlightened and dealt with by Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
