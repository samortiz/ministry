   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, my initial feeling of joy did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few days later I became angry with my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My anger troubled me, and I had no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of economy, I had chaos once again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually I prayed to the Lord about this and was forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The peace returned, and I had the sense of something bright, pleasant, and lovely within.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, I did not know about the divine economy, but I was experiencing it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you know what the Christian life is?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christian life is a life of economy mixed with chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The economy is divine, and the chaos is satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the Christian life involves both the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Christian life is a history of economy and chaos, of chaos and economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During our time with the Lord in the morning, we experience economy, but later in the day we may experience chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This has been my experience during the nearly seventy years I have been a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I am learning the secret, the strategy, of defeating chaos and of coming back to economy and order.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am learning how to be filled not with chaos but with economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have not only God's economy within me I have God as my economy within me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very God who dwells in me is my economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a mixture of economy and chaos, the Christian life is a miniature of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the entire Bible, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, is a record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our married life we also have the economy of God and the chaos of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason for this situation is that in the universe there are two sources God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes when we preach the gospel to thoughtful people, they ask us why there are these two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such people may say, "Why is there Satan as well as God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is good, but Satan is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there were no Satan, everything would be fine."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others may ask why there were two trees in the garden of Eden the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a tree that involves knowledge, good, evil, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To the ones who ask these questions I would say, "You should go to God and ask Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not know the answer to your questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I do know that the history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to understand the divine economy and the satanic chaos, we need to see the difference between the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God created the heavens and the earth, and this became His first creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's first creation eventually became old and involved with death, for to become old is to become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, the words first, old, and dead are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first creation did not accomplish God's purpose directly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it was God's intention to gain the new creation through the first creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that through the old creation God will have a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning this, in 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 6:15 says, "Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We were the old man, but we have been regenerated to become the new man, and the new man is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although God created the heavens and the earth, He was not in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that the old creation does not have God as its life, nature, and person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in the new creation we have God within us as our life, our nature, our person, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do we need love?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our God within us is love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do we need light?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our God within us is light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do we need the divine attributes?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our God within us is the divine attributes, which will be expressed in our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, in the new creation God is everything.</S>
