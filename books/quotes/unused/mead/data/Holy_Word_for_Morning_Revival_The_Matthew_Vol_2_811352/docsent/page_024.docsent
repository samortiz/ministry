   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 12:43-45, 48, 50</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>43 When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>44 Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And it comes and finds it unoccupied, swept, and decorated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>45 Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus shall it be also with this evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>48 But He answered and said to him who spoke to Him, Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>50 For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 43 through 45 indicate that the rejecting generation will become worse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The unclean spirit, a demon v. 22 , seeks rest but cannot find it in waterless places because the lodging place of demons, after God's judgment by water in Genesis 1:2, is the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>See Life-study of Genesis, Message Two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since a demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns into the human body that it originally possessed and settles down there vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Doctrinally, verse 43 continues verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between these two verses is a record of the Jews' rejection of Christ and of Christ's forsaking of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon possessed man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the eyes of the Lord the rejecting Jews were like demon possessed people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon-possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They would only sweep away the dirt and decorate by adding good things to beautify themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would not receive Christ and allow Him to fill them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they would remain empty and unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord describes this house v. 44 with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word was also a prophecy, a prophecy that has been fulfilled and yet is still to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire nation of Israel today has been cleansed swept , and so many things have been cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, they have been decorated with various good things; the Jewish people excel in science and other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the nation of Israel remains unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I love Israel, but I must speak according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that year by year the nation of Israel will become more and more devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>More and more demonic things will be found there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Jews are like a clean house, but they will not accept Christ and receive Him into them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, they remain unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The nation of Israel today has no goal; hence, it is unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this, as the Lord Jesus was speaking to the crowds, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him .The Lord said, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>48-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whoever does the will of His Father is a brother who helps Him, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verses 46 through 50 we see a great turn, even a dispensational turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, Romans 11 says that Israel was cut off, and that the Gentiles have been grafted in. These events took place at the end of Matthew 12.</S>
