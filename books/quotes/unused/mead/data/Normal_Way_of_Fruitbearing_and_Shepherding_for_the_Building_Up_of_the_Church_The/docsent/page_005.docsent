   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CARING FOR PEOPLE AS NURSING MOTHERS AND EXHORTING FATHERS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:7-8, 11; Matt 4:19; John 21:15; S. S. 1:7-8 DEALING WITH THE LIGHT WE RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we stressed the need to go to the Lord, deal with Him, and receive light from Him to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians hope that a light from heaven would shine on them as it did on Saul of Tarsus Acts 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there has never been another Saul in history.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not expect that one day the Lord will have mercy and shine His light on us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proper way to receive enlightenment is to deal with the light that we already have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We already have a certain amount of light, whether or not we are willing to obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Need for Training</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to Deal with Matters Thoroughly</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As proper persons, we rise up in the morning at the right time, make our bed, wash, dress, and have breakfast, and after breakfast we arrange our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To behave in this way is not to be sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of our fallen nature, however, almost every Christian is sloppy in his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because no one exercises control over us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our schooling, we have a teacher, professor, or at least a grading system to exercise control over us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Similarly, many who are sloppy in other things are not sloppy on their job because their desire not to lose their job controls them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the spiritual life, however, no one exercises control over us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church cannot fire a brother for being sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we need the training.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The training is not merely the teaching of the Bible or of skills for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The training is simply a spiritual discipline that builds us up to discipline ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As seeking ones of the Lord, we must learn to discipline ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many housewives know how to keep their house clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they mean business as a housekeeper, they will not ignore a piece of waste paper when they see it but will throw it into the waste paper basket.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even a small piece of waste paper not picked up is a proof that someone is a sloppy housekeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to discipline ourselves in the Christian life in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not tolerate having any matters that remain undealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dealing with the Light That We Already Have</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may say that they do not know how to receive light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In actuality, we already have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we see a piece of waste paper in our being, this indicates that we have some light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we may not care for the light, and we may not want to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may see many things that need to be dealt with, but we may not care to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, we may claim that we do not have the light and do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do know what to do, but if we do not deal with what we see, we will not receive further light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Light brings in more light Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This applies even to physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a good housekeeper cleans her furniture thoroughly, her eyes will be exercised to see dust that others cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, if we never clean our furniture in a thorough way, we will lose the ability to see the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The difference is a matter not of light but of sight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may all be under the same light, but our sight is different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Proper sight depends much upon the exercise of our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Recently, I lost my sight, but this was remedied by surgery on my retina.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After my surgery, due to the shortage of the exercise of my eyes, my vision remained poor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As I began to exercise my eyes more, my sight gradually increased.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Strictly speaking, this improvement was due not to healing but to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not true that we, as persons saved, regenerated, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, have no light, and it is also not true that we have no sight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do have light and sight, but we may not exercise our sight to see, and we may not care for what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the Lord s mercy, we may need to go to the Lord one night and say, Lord, I will not go to sleep or do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will simply remain in Your presence until everything is cleared up, and there is no further speaking from my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not necessarily need to say, Lord, shine upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord is already shining.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To pray for light may simply be an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not excuse ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we should say, Lord, I am sloppy in this matter that You have shown me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Following this, we can confess a second matter and ask for forgiveness and cleansing of that filthiness with the Lord s precious blood 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we can go on to further matters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more we go on, the more light we will receive; the more sight we exercise, the more things we will see.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will remain very busy in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may think there are too many things to deal with, but the Lord may say that there are more to come.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps after fifteen minutes we will fall to the floor repenting and weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we obey a small light, that light will bring in further light, and if we obey the further light, it will bring in even greater light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not wait for enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are already in the light and under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the meaning of going to the Lord to deal thoroughly with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not say that we do not know how to clean our room or where to start.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should simply clean the spot on which we are standing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we clean the first spot, we will see a second spot, and after we clean the second spot, right away we will see a third one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more thoroughly we clean, the more we will see the need of cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, we may need to come back to the same spot to clean it again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We thought it was clean the first time, but when we come back to it, we will see that the first cleansing was not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Regrettably, though, we are too sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have listened to many messages, we appreciated them, and we said Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now the light has already begun to shine on us all, and we are under the Lord s enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We simply need to obey the light, exercise our sight, and have a thorough dealing in the presence of the Lord.</S>
