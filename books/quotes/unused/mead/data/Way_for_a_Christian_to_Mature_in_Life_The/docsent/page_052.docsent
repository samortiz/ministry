   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE WAY FOR A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO MATURE IN LIFE FROM HAVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO HAVING THE LORD S IMAGE FIVE IMPORTANT MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians 3:17-18 says, And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these two verses, there are five important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is the Lord, the second is the Spirit, the third is freedom, the fourth is glory, and the fifth is image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 17, which says, And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom, joins three of these matters together the Lord, the Spirit, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 18 then says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding...the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that when we behold the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into His image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse joins all five matters together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning of verse 17, there is the Lord Himself; at the end of verse 18, there is the image of the Lord; and in between these two matters are three others the Spirit, freedom, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To go from the first item to the last from the Lord to the image of the Lord we need to pass through the Spirit, freedom, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE HEART BEING THE GATEWAY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FOR THE SPIRIT TO ENTER INTO THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Maturity in the Christian life is to go from having the Lord to having the Lord s image.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, to go from having only the Lord to having the Lord s image as well is the way for a Christian to mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is the Spirit, and when we were saved, He entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spirit is the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Around this center are the different parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally, we did not have the Spirit of the Lord, the Lord Himself, in our being neither in our spirit nor in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also did not have the elements of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we did not have the form of the Lord or the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we got saved, God regenerated us, and the Spirit of the Lord entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From then on, this Lord Spirit has been in our spirit and has been trying to spread from our spirit to our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for Him to do this, He has to pass through a gateway.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This gateway is our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heart is a gateway between our spirit and our soul, joining the spirit to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the heart does not open the gate and allow the spirit to be released, the Spirit has no way to get into the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, 2 Corinthians 3:16 speaks of the importance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It says, Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The veil is taken away because the heart turns to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that in order for us to be face to face with the Lord, our heart must turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we have been saved, instead of being toward the Lord, our heart is often toward many things other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because our heart turns away from the Lord, there is a veil between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot see Him, and we are not able to fellowship with Him face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the situation until the day that our heart turns to Him, and the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we see Him and are face to face with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows us that the heart is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that the heart is between the spirit and the soul means that the heart is between man and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man s heart is toward the Lord, he is face to face with the Lord, and he can fellowship with the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if his heart is toward things other than the Lord and is turned away from the Lord, there will be a veil, a barrier, between the Lord and him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a person closes his heart to the Lord, he locks the Lord in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the heart is turned away from the Lord, the Lord is detained and held in the spirit.</S>
