Psalm 43:3 says, "Send forth Your light and Your truth." What is the purpose of God's light? It is for enlightening the truth. This is very important. We know God's truth through the light. Truth does not come from the preaching of the word; it comes from God's light. Today if you ask the brothers and sisters, "Have you died in Christ?", many will say, "I am dead. Yet I do not know why it is not producing any effect on me." This is because they have only heard the doctrine; they have not seen the truth. Whoever sees the reality has received the light. A brother said that when God opened his eyes to see Romans 6, he saw Ephesians 6 as well. He saw that his death was a fact, the Lord's victory was a fact, and his participation in the Lord's victory was also a fact. In the past, he was only hoping for it; now he knew that he had it. In the past he was only hoping that the Lord would overcome; now he could praise the Lord for having overcome. He testified that this way of living was totally different from his former way of living. Formerly, everything was in the way of yearning and hope. Now everything was reality. He was no longer trying to grasp onto something; everything was in his hands already. When the light comes, a person has to jump up and say, "It is finished!"</p><p>Every Christian has been enlightened at least once when he was saved. When a person is saved, he sees that he does not have to hope to be saved or hope to receive eternal life. He does not have to hope to receive these things in the future. Instead, he thanks and praises God for accomplishing all these things in Christ. Once the light shines on the truth, a person becomes a Christian. Every Christian becomes a Christian through the light shining on the truth. All spiritual realities come through the shining of the light upon the truth.</p><p>Therefore, when a truth is being preached without the accompanying shining of the light, it becomes a doctrine. When truth is preached, and God's light is upon it, the truth becomes revelation. To receive a revelation is to receive the truth. Those who receive a doctrine are merely filled with ideas in their mind. Only those who have received a revelation receive reality and life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH AND THE WORD OF TRUTH</h2><p>When God's light shines, the Holy Spirit brings us into the spiritual reality of what the light shines on. On the one hand, there is the Spirit of truth; the Comforter is the Spirit of truth. On the other hand, there is the Bible, which is the word of truth. There are first the facts of truth&mdash;the things that God has accomplished in Christ. When the Bible tells us these facts of truth, and we believe in the words of truth, the Holy Spirit brings us into the truth itself, that is, into the spiritual reality itself. The Lord Jesus is the reality, and God brings us into the reality through His Spirit. In this way, we no longer have a doctrine or a theory; we do not have to live in our feelings or our experiences anymore; instead, we can live in Christ's accomplished facts.</p><p>Hence, the main question is whether or not we have revelation. When we have revelation, we will not think of our own experiences or our own feelings. We will believe that everything on God's side is real. Many Christians consider that their old man is still living, that it is a reality. They dare not believe that they were crucified with Christ. But if they see the revelation, they will change. The revelation will show them that their old man is surely and undeniably dead. We must remember that only those who receive the revelation of the Holy Spirit enter into the reality. The Holy Spirit gives us revelation and shows us what is real before we can ascertain what is real and what is not.</p><p>When God accomplishes something and we see what He has accomplished, we have the real experience. Praise and thank the Lord, when we see what God has accomplished and when we say yes to whatever God has said yes to, we have the real experience. May the Lord open our eyes to see the truth. If we truly see the truth, the truth will set us free. Our liberation comes from the truth. Our freedom comes from the truth. We should all seek after the truth, which means that we should all seek after reality. May God lead us into all reality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
