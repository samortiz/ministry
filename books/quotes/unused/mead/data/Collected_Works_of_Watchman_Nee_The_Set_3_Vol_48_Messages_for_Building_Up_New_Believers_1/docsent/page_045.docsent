   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a new believer has received the laying on of hands, has come into the church, and has come under the headship of Christ, he has to see the oneness of believers in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, he has to realize the abolishment of all distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that there should be no distinctions among believers who have become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word whether signifies the removal of distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are no worldly distinctions in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 13 continues, "And were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Galatians 3:27-28 says, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here it says that in Christ we all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are those who have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words put on are just one word in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not mean "wearing" as much as it does "covering up."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were all baptized into Christ and have all put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, slave nor free man, male and female, for in Christ we all have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that our oneness in Christ has abolished all of our former distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colossians 3:10-11 says, "And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This passage also says that there are no more distinctions among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians 3:28 says, "There cannot be," and this verse also says, "There cannot be."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There cannot be distinctions because we have put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have received and been incorporated into the new man, which was created according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this image there cannot be Greeks or Jews, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man, for Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, all the believers are one; they have become a single entity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From these three portions of the Scripture, we see that all believers are one in Christ, and all of their distinctions have been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the basis upon which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we bring all our earthly distinctions into the church and into the Lord, we will corrupt the church and spoil the relationships among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must see that we have all been made one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our past distinctions no longer exist among us when we are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are no distinctions in the new man and in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At least five distinctions are spoken of in the verses above.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We see five contrasting pairs, but actually there are six differences.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, there is the difference between Greek and Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then there is the difference between free man and slave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following this there are differences between male and female, barbarians and Scythians, and circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the apostle Paul, no matter what differences there are among men, we all have been made one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this world, the most important thing to a person is his position, that is, his status.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I am a certain kind of person, I have to live up to my position or my status.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we are to be Christians at all, these considerations must go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we bring our personal status and position into the new man, we will make the new man old because these distinctions belong to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, when we come to the church, we must give up all these things.</S>
