   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINE THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 3 THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall see another aspect of the status of the church that of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>C. The Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 2:19 says, "You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The term "fellow citizens" indicates the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, are citizens of God's kingdom, which is a sphere wherein God exercises His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as anyone is a believer, he is a citizen of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This citizenship involves rights and responsibilities, two things that always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We enjoy the rights of the kingdom, and we bear the responsibilities of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2:19 Paul covers two aspects of the church: the kingdom, indicated by the term "fellow citizens," and the family of God, indicated by the phrase "the household of God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His household to enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's kingdom is a matter of rights and responsibilities; all believers who were born into the house of God have the civil rights of and their responsibility in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in 2:19 two profound matters are covered: the kingdom of God with its rights and responsibilities and the house of God with its enjoyment of the Father's life and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 2:19 speaks of the saints, the household of God, and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints are individuals, but the household of God is corporate and results in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were no household, there could be no kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we are saints, individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, corporately, we are the house of God resulting in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is significant that in verse 19 Paul refers to the kingdom of God before the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's thought here concerns our former status as strangers and sojourners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Strangers and sojourners are related to a kingdom, not to a household.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are aliens in this country are not aliens in relation to a family but in relation to the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because strangers and sojourners are aliens to kingdoms, not to families, Paul mentions the kingdom first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this verse Paul's main concept is that of citizenship in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom, however, is composed of families.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, Paul also mentions the household of God, that is, the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 2:19 affords us the basis for saying that the church today is God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The citizens mentioned here are related to a kingdom, a nation, not to a family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A family is composed of members, not of citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, we are members of God's household; on the other hand, we are citizens of God's nation, of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the church today is God's kingdom, we are in the kingdom in reality only when we live and walk in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we behave according to the old man or live in the flesh or the self, we, in a practical way, are out of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that when we are in the flesh, we are in the old realm of the fallen human nature, which has been fully usurped by Satan to form his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, a genuine Christian, if he lives in the flesh instead of in the spirit, may live in a practical way not in the kingdom of God but in the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only when we live, walk, behave, and have our being altogether in our spirit, not in our natural man, are we in the kingdom of God and, in reality, are the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The kingdom of God, like the house of God, is a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church as the house of God is a corporate person because this house is the family of God, the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom is likewise a corporate person because it is also a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether we are living in the church as the house of God or as the kingdom of God depends on whether we are living as members or as citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To live as members of the house of God is a matter of enjoyment, but to live in the kingdom of God is a matter of bearing responsibility and of being regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are members of our Father's household, and we are citizens of our God's kingdom.</S>
