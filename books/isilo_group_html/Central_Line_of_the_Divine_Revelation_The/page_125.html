To Cause God's Redeemed People<br>to Live an Unleavened Life</H2><P>The element in our nature is altogether sinful. But Christ has come into us to be another element within us, a sinless element. This other element causes God's redeemed people to live an unleavened life (Exo. 13:7; 1 Cor. 5:7a). First Corinthians 5:7 says, "Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump." A new lump is a lump without leaven. This means that we become a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17) without sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. To Make the Course of Life<br>of God's Redeemed People a Feasting One</H2><P>The unleavened bread eaten by God's redeemed makes the course of life of God's redeemed people a feasting one (Exo. 13:6; 1 Cor. 5:8). Because we are God's redeemed, our life should always be a happy, feasting life. Throughout the course of our life, we should always be pleasant. We should be pleasant all our days, weeks, months, and years. However, we often are not like this because we eat leavened bread. Leaven signifies the sinful element. Whenever we eat leavened bread, we become unhappy people. We become unpleasant whenever sin has come in. When we are unleavened, we are happy and everything is pleasant with us. This is the function of the unleavened bread within us.</P><P>We have one Christ with two aspects, the redeeming aspect and the unleavened aspect. In the redeeming aspect, He becomes our food to satisfy us and to strengthen us to run the course God has set before us. In the unleavened aspect, He is the unleavened bread to supply us with the unleavened element so that we can live an unleavened life. In this way we can live a life without sin in following the Lord through the entire course of our life. Living such a life, we become happy. Every day, every week, every month, and every year is a feast, and we are feasting all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Enjoyment<br>of the Heavenly and Spiritual Supply</H2><P>As the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they needed more than just the Passover with the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. So God opened the heavens to give them manna. The Hebrew word for manna means, "What is it?" Even today no one knows what manna was. Yet we do know that manna came from the Lord. Every day for forty years the children of Israel saw one of the greatest miracles in the universe. Each morning, wherever they journeyed, manna was outside their tents. Yet the children of Israel were stubborn and still could not believe. Actually, we are the same as they. The Lord still does such a miracle every day. Whenever we wake up, we should say, "O Lord!" To say "O Lord" in the morning and to have morning revival is to gather manna.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_124.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_126.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 125</div><br></body></html>
