Revelation 12:8-9</H2><P>"And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven. And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him." </P><P>The designation "dragon" implies cruelty; the old serpent, deceit; the Devil, temptation; and Satan, opposition. The devil is cast down from heaven, and he draws one third of the angels down with him. He also opens the abyss (9:1). At this point, how dark the world is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. A LOUD VOICE<br>(REVELATION 12:10-12)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 12:10</H2><P>"And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night." </P><P>In the past God used the blood to redeem, but now He uses His power to redeem. The power of the kingdom of God is perfect before the throne of God; however, before Satan is cast down, God's will cannot be carried out in the air. After the one thousand two hundred sixty days, the kingdom of God will come to the earth, and God's will shall be carried out on the earth also. (In Matthew 12:28, when the demons are cast out, the kingdom of God comes.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 12:11</H2><P>"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death." </P><P>There are three things which overcome accusations: (1) The blood of the Lord. (The accusations may not always be false; hence, we need the blood.) We rest in the precious blood of the Lamb (Rom. 8:34). (2) The word of our testimony. We should not only believe with the heart, but should also speak out with the mouth. Once we speak, Satan can do nothing. (3) Loving not the soul-life even unto death. The greatest trial is death. If we are not afraid of death, even unto death, Satan can do nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 12:12</H2><P>"Therefore be glad, O heavens and those who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time."</P><P>In Revelation 13:1 a beast (Antichrist) rises up out of the sea. In 13:11 another beast (the false prophet) comes up out of the earth. In 9:1 a star (the dragon) is cast down from heaven. These three will come to the earth; therefore, "Woe to the earth and the sea."</P><P>The foreknowledge of Satan here, "knowing that he has only a short time," is comparable to the foreknowledge of historians; it comes through inference.</P><P>During the tribulation, there is the wrath of God, and there is also the wrath of Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DRAGON PERSECUTING THE WOMAN<br>(REVELATION 12:13-17)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 12:13</H2><P>"And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child."</P><P>The prophets in the Old Testament have much to say about this. During the great tribulation, Jerusalem will be besieged by the Gentiles (Zech. 14:1-2). The persecution of the woman by the dragon is the fulfillment of this. It is also the execution of Revelation 12:12.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 12:14</H2><P>"And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent." </P><P>Since the woman is a sign, the wings must be a sign also. They signify the extraordinary power given to them by God to enable them to run fast. This is similar to the way God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, as an eagle bears its young on its wings (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12). The fleeing here matches that described in Matthew 24:16-20. At that time, the Jews will be protected by God in a special way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
