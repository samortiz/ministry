   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PERFECTED SAINTS DIRECTLY BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we have seen that in the building up of the Body of Christ the first One who builds is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does Christ build the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He does it in His ascended position by giving to the church gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord does not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it is the gifts given to the church that perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The perfected saints in turn participate in the work of the ministry to directly build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here is the distinction between the church in the Lord's recovery and the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The denominations are built up as a congregation by a few pastors and preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the church in the Lord's recovery is built up as the Body of Christ by every perfected saint.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Holding to Truth in Love</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 4:15 shows us that to build up the Body of Christ we first need to hold to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the universe everything is vain and empty; there is no truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Ephesians, in the universe there are only three things that are true and will last to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first is God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very practical and real.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to hold to this in love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This love is not our own love; rather, it is the love of God in Christ becoming our love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this love we love God, Christ, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to hold to God's economy in this love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second thing is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is most real.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All other doctrines, speakings, and different teachings are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must hold to Christ and forsake everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third thing is the church as Christ's Body, the organism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is also true and will last for eternity because it is the Body of Christ, the true One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To build up the Body of Christ we must hold to these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the other things we must reject.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Growing into Christ the Head in All Things</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to build up the Body of Christ, we also need to grow up into Christ the Head in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we are saved, in many things we are still outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to grow into Christ in one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, when the sisters are going to make a dress, they often make their own decisions in choosing the style, the color, and the fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They do not allow the Lord to be Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, the brothers may not allow the Lord to be Lord in deciding whether they should leave their hair long or short.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In too many things we have not allowed Christ to be Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, in those things we are not in the Lord but rather outside the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to grow into the Lord in one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires that we acknowledge the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a sister is going to make a dress, she should pray to the Lord, "Lord, I am not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You decide what style, color, and fabric the dress should be."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, she will grow into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, we have to let Christ increase and grow in all of our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Christ grows within us, we will grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, the growth in life is not our growth, but the growth of the Lord Jesus in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This requires that we give Him the ground and acknowledge His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to hand over our rights to Him and allow Him to have the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, He will occupy us and will grow in us, and we will grow in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this, we will grow into Christ the Head in all things.</S>
