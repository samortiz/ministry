<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hearing and Receiving Our Father's Words</H2><P>The writer says in 4:3 that he was a son to his father, tender and the only beloved in the sight of his mother. In verses 10 through 13 he says, "Hear, my son, and receive my words,/And the years of your life will be many./I have taught you in the way of wisdom;/I have led you in the paths of uprightness./When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;/And when you run, you will not stumble./Take hold of instruction; do not let go;/Guard her, for she is your life." Verses 20 through 22 say, "Be attentive to my words;/Incline your ear to my sayings./Do not let them depart from your sight;/Keep them in the midst of your heart./For they are life to those who find them,/And healing to all their flesh."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Listening to Our Father</H2><P>Proverbs 8:32, 34-35 say, "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me;/For blessed are they who keep my ways....Blessed is the man who listens to me,/Watching daily at my doors,/Waiting at my doorposts./For whoever finds me finds life,/And will obtain favor from Jehovah."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. A Wise Son Making a Father Glad</H2><P>A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother (10:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Mocking Eye Being Plucked Out by Ravens</H2><P>The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it (30:17, 11). This is a serious warning regarding the honoring of our parents.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. HOLDING MARRIAGE IN HONOR</H2><P>The fourth nugget is to hold marriage in honor. In order to live a proper human life, we must hold marriage in honor.</P><P>I love America, but the marriage life in America bothers me very much. In American society the contact between males and females is too loose, without restriction. In this sense, the United States today is like Sodom. I am concerned about this because it offends God to the uttermost.</P><P>Marriage produces not only children but also parents. So that man can exist on earth to continue God's economy, honoring parents and holding marriage in honor are necessary. I hope that all the saints in the Lord's recovery will bear a strong testimony of honoring their parents and of holding marriage in honor.</P><P>Females should always be restricted by a sense of honorable shame. Today in America young women have physical contact with young men without shame. This kind of loose contact can easily lead to fornication. The co-workers who serve the Lord and often contact people must be careful. Many useful servants of the Lord have been spoiled because of their careless contact with the opposite sex. Revering God, honoring our parents, and holding marriage in honor are a real protection to us.</P>
