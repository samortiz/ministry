God Sending Forth from Zion<br>the Scepter of Christ's Power<br>to Rule over All the Nations</H2><P>"Jehovah will send forth/The scepter of Your strength from Zion:/Rule in the midst of Your enemies" (v. 2). Zion here is not the Zion on earth but the Zion in the heavens, as mentioned in Hebrews 12 and Revelation 14. Hebrews 12:22 says that we have "come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." Revelation 14:1-5 shows us that the living overcomers will be raptured to Zion in the heavens. From this heavenly Zion God will send out the scepter of Christ's power to rule over all the nations. The word "enemies" in Psalm 110:2 refers to the nations. Today the nations are His enemies. For example, in their way of dealing with Israel, the Arab nations are the enemies of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Christ's People Offering Themselves Willingly<br>in the Days of His Forces (Army)<br>in the Splendor of Their Consecration</H2><P>"Your people will offer themselves willingly/In the days of Your forces/In the splendor of their consecration" (v. 3a). Literally, the Hebrew words translated "offer themselves willingly" mean "be freewill offerings." Instead of the word "forces," some translations render the Hebrew word as "army" or "war." These different renderings all indicate that some kind of fighting is raging on. Today is still a time of fighting because Christ still does not have a footstool. Hence, this ministry is engaged in a constant struggle. We stand against and annul every kind of improper ground concerning the church, whether Catholic or Protestant, and this causes opposition and fighting.</P><P>In verse 3 we are told that in the day of His forces, or army, Christ's people will offer themselves willingly "in the splendor of their consecration." Do you realize that in the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a kind of splendor? Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration. Giving up everything on earth, thousands have offered themselves freely to Christ, and with this offering there was the splendor of consecration. John Nelson Darby was such a person. Darby lived to be eighty-four years of age and, because of his love for Christ, he never married. One day, in his old age, he was staying alone in a hotel and he said, "Lord Jesus, I still love You." No doubt, Darby was a freewill offering to the Lord in the splendor of consecration.</P><P>Instead of the word "splendor" some versions use the word "adornment." The splendor of consecration is an adornment. We need to be adorned by offering ourselves willingly to the Lord. If we do this, we will be beautified with a divine, heavenly splendor.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_285.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_287.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 286</div><br></body></html>
