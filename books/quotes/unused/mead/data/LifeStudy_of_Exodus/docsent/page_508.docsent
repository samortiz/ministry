   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AND THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that before the Lord s glorification the compound Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of God was present in Genesis 1, and the Holy Spirit was involved with the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, as Andrew Murray makes clear in the fifth chapter of The Spirit of Christ, the term the Holy Spirit is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit is first mentioned at the beginning of the New Testament when Christ was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For Christ to be conceived of the Holy Spirit means that His humanity, as part of God s creation, is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The conceiving Spirit in Greek is called the Spirit, the Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But although the Holy Spirit was present at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit was not yet until Christ was resurrected, glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was then that the compounding of the Spirit was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the writings of John, the term the Holy Spirit is seldom used.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, especially in the book of Revelation, John often speaks of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This statement is repeated throughout chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then Revelation 14:13 says, Yes, says the Spirit... and Revelation 22:17 says, And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his first Epistle, John emphasizes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First John 2:20 says, And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 John 2:27 he says, The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, when John was writing these verses, he had in mind the picture of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you know what the anointing is?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The anointing is the moving, the painting, of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have this anointing, this painting, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the anointing we have received teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We worship the Lord that, over the years, He has made us clear concerning the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past, many Christians experienced only the Passover, the manna, and, at most, the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their Christian experience did not come to the point of partaking of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why have so many Christians failed to experience the compound ointment?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason is that this Spirit is for the building up of a spiritual house and for the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Peter 2 we have the spiritual house and also the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, in the book of Exodus, we have the tabernacle and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapters twenty-five through twenty-seven the tabernacle is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This corresponds to the spiritual house in 1 Peter 2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine we have the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, at Mount Sinai two things were made ready the tabernacle and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, we have the description of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that the ointment is for God s dwelling place and for the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not care for God s building and His priesthood, we cannot experience the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because of the lack of the building up of the spiritual house, Christians throughout the centuries have not been able to see the matter of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, there has been a lack of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ointment was not merely for the anointing of individual priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to Exodus, Aaron and his sons were to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that the anointing was for the priesthood, for a body of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Testament two different Greek words are translated priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One of these words means the priestly office; the other means a body or group of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Exodus we have not only the office of a priest; we also have the corporate body of priests, the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would have the anointing of the compound Spirit, we must have God s dwelling place and a corporate priesthood.</S>
