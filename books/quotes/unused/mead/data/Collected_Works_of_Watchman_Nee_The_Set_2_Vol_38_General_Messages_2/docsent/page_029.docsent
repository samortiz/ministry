   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MOSES NOT BEING ABLE TO ENTER CANAAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Numbers 20, Moses smote the rock at Meribah, and God forbade him from entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Moses later pleaded, "Let me please cross over" Deut 3:25 , God would not answer his pleading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God said that he could not enter Canaan, it meant that he could not enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know it was wrong for Moses to lose his temper and smite the rock with his rod.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we do not realize the gravity of the mistake he committed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We think that Moses was a meek person and that he unfortunately lost his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have seen many gentle persons lose their temper, yet God did not deal with them severely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why was God so severe toward Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us see what God said.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said to Moses and Aaron, "You did not...sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" Num 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean to not sanctify the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that we have implicated the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To sanctify God is to set Him apart, to express His distinctive character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to sanctify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if Moses lost his temper ten times, others would only say that Moses had a quick temper, and the consequence would not be great.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when Moses lost his temper this time, it affected God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God said that by losing his temper this way, Moses had involved God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not sanctify God; he did not put God in His rightful place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem with Moses' temper was that he lost his temper on the one hand, and water came out of the smitten rock on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's work was evident.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This made it difficult to distinguish who was involved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses involved God, because the Israelites might have thought in their hearts, "Now we know that God is this kind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is a God who loses His temper and reviles."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was implicated through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Moses lost his temper and men only saw his bad temper, the consequence would have been small, and God would not have needed to seriously deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God paid attention to this incident because Moses performed a miracle on the one hand water came out and God's power was manifested and lost his temper on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Israelites could not distinguish the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They might have said that God caused the water to flow out for their drink and that God also lost His temper and reviled them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses dragged God into this confusing picture and did not make a clear distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This offended the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The consequence was serious; God could not let him off easily; He had to disqualify Moses from entering the land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>UZZAH BEING KILLED</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In considering the matter of offending the testimony, we cannot help but recall the hand of Uzzah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God to take hold of it, and he was smitten by God and died by the ark 2 Sam 6:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did this to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have said in the past that Uzzah tried to take hold of the ark with hands of flesh, but this is still not clear enough; it does not convey the seriousness of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must see that the ark is the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before David became king, the ark was captured.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time there was no Uzzah to protect the ark, yet the ark was able to protect itself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ark was among the heathens, and it was moved from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was no Uzzah or even a single Israelite to protect the ark, yet the ark did not fall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It had never fallen, and man could do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When David moved it back, it was among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Did it need someone to take hold of it?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see the sin of Uzzah.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the ark was among enemies, it protected itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When it was among God's people, did it need someone to protect it?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God wanted the Levites to lift the ark, yet they put it on a cart drawn by oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the ark fell, that would be God's concern.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the use of man's hand to aid His will damaged His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why God would not let this matter go.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to learn the lesson of allowing God to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who do not know God's will try to help God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we spend some time before the Lord to consider the end of many men in the past, we can identify a principle: no one is allowed to offend God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever anything offends God's attributes, His authority, His way, His plan, or His testimony, His disciplining hand will quickly come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God cannot allow His testimony to be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will demonstrate that He is a God of holiness, a God of power, and a God of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we must stand before Him in fear and trembling and not be careless or foolish at all.</S>
