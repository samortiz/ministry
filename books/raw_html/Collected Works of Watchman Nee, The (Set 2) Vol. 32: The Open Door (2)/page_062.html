<h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>I received the tenth issue of The Open Door last night, and I realize that the Lord has heard the prayers of His children everywhere and preserved them in peace. Enclosed please find X dollars and distribute it according to the following way [omitted]. May the Lord bless this little sum in the same way that He blessed the five loaves and two fishes. The brothers and sisters in Chefoo are at peace under the gracious protection of the Lord. Meetings go on as usual. Brother Witness Lee is still working for the Lord's gospel in Peking and Tientsin and has not returned. The brothers who are in business or in other enterprises in Chefoo have experienced the gracious protection of the Lord. Although things are not as good as they were, they are tolerable. Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient for us. Hallelujah! As long as we have the Lord, we are satisfied! May the love of the Lord always be in our heart until His return, amen. Peace and joy be with you in the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters before the Lord's table.</p><p>Brother Chao Jing-hwai</p><h2 class="head2">Tsuan-Shan, Bei-Si, Fukien Province</h2><p>After reading Issue No. 9 of The Open Door and realizing that so many members, who possess the same life as we, were having so much trouble, the brothers here feel quite grieved. We received the following sum from the offering box, designated for the brothers and sisters who are suffering. Please distribute it to the needy brothers and sisters according to the leading of the Lord's Spirit. This little sum is but an expression of our sympathy.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tung-yuen on behalf of all the saints in<br />Tsuan-Shan, Bei-Si, Fukien</p><h2 class="head2">Sien-You, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars collected from the offering box during the past two Lord's Days. Please distribute it to the needy saints in the war zone. Two months ago three brothers and nine sisters were baptized among us. We truly thank and praise the Lord for this. Last month Sisters Wang Yu-ju and Chen Tien-luh came from Pu-Tien to preach the gospel and to do some personal evangelization work. By His mercy His blessing was with us. Many women were saved. Then Sisters Bau Hsu-min and Lee Mu-cha came to do some perfecting work. Sisters Wang and Chan are back in Pu-Tien, but Sisters Bau and Lee are still here. May such work that is for the Lord bring much blessing to His children. The brothers and sisters in Sien-You are very young and weak. We ask that the brothers and sisters who have received grace in other places pray much for us. We need much enlightening and edification.</p><p>Brothers Cheng Kwang-yau and Cheng Kwang-yu,<br />representing the church in Sien-You, September 6</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door and X dollars for the relief of brothers and sisters in difficulty. Please distribute the amounts on our behalf. The brothers and sisters are all safe here. Many women have been saved. The political situation is also quite calm. Peace and joy to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Cheng Kwang-yau,<br />representing the church in Sien-You, October 3</p>
