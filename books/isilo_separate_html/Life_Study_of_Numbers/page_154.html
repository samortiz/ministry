A Burnt Offering for the Feast of Weeks</H2><P>Numbers 28:26-31 is concerned with the burnt offering for the feast of weeks. This burnt offering was offered in the day of the first fruits, that is, the fiftieth day of the feast of weeks (v. 26), when a new meal offering was offered to Jehovah (Lev. 23:10-11, 15-16). A holy convocation was held on the same day with no laborious work. The offering for the feast of weeks was the same as that offered at the beginning of the month.</P><P>God needs daily food, weekly food, monthly food, and yearly food. In addition to enjoying ordinary food, God wants to enjoy food at the yearly feasts. We have pointed out that these feasts correspond to our spiritual experience. The Passover typifies Christ, who is our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), and Pentecost typifies the processed Triune God, who has become the consummated, life-giving, dispensing Spirit. Such a Spirit is the fullness of the Triune God and also the consummation of our enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>All the offerings in Numbers 28, which are God's food, point to Christ. This indicates that Christ is not only our food but also God's food. God and we enjoy the same food&#151;Christ. The center of Numbers 28 is Christ. Christ is the intrinsic substance of this chapter.</P><P>Christ is also the peace that enables us to have fellowship with God. The best fellowship involves eating. If we would enjoy the best fellowship with God, we need to serve Him with Christ as His food. Then as we are having fellowship with God, we and God will have the mutual enjoyment of Christ by eating and drinking Him.</P><P>Although Christ is God's food, He is not God's food in a direct way. Rather, Christ is God's food served to God by us.</P><P>Eventually, however, God's food also becomes our food. If we carefully read the book of Leviticus, we will see that the burnt offering is to be wholly and absolutely burned for God's satisfaction. No portion of the burnt offering is to be eaten by the ones who offer it. However, the burnt offering is accompanied by a meal offering, a large portion of which is for the offerers. This indicates that when we serve God, offering Christ to Him as His food, God takes care of us. God seems to say, "You serve Me with My food, and now I would like to share a portion of this food with you." In this way we enjoy Christ with God. As we are feasting, God also is feasting. He is feasting with us, and we are feasting with Him. In mutuality, God and we feast together on the all-inclusive Christ.</P><P>The burnt offering typifies Christ as the One who, as a man, is absolutely for God and who satisfies Him. The meal offering typifies Christ in His perfect, fine, balanced humanity. The drink offering typifies Christ's pouring Himself out for God. When Christ was dying on the cross, He was pouring Himself out as a drink offering to God. The sin offering typifies Christ as our sin offering redeeming us back to God and solving the problem of our sin, sins, and failures. With Christ as all these offerings, we may now enjoy Christ with God. First, we enjoy Christ as the One given to us by God. Having experienced Christ, we present Him to God as His food, and then God shares with us a portion of the Christ we have offered to Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_153.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_155.html">Next</a> </body></html>
