Is our spirit for the law or for Christ? We may say that we are for Christ, but we are also for the law. Our being for Christ is mostly in theory, but our being for the law is very practical. We act mostly according to the law, according to yes and no, right and wrong, and not according to Christ. We even educate and teach our children according to right and wrong. A parent may say to his child, "That is not right; you shouldn't do it." But have we ever said, "That is not Christ; you shouldn't do it"? Who ever tells someone not to do something because that is not Christ? This should help us to realize that we are for Christ in theory, but actually we practice the law. Do we practice Christ or the law? To practice Christ is to get out of the realm of yes and no, right and wrong, good and evil. This means that we get out of the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We may say that our spirit is for Christ, but in practice we live according to the law, according to what is right and wrong, good and evil.</P><P>The book of Psalms shows us the contrast between the law and Christ. The first psalm is concerning keeping the law, and the second psalm tells us to kiss Christ. Which is higher? I am not asking which one is right or wrong, but which one is higher. Surely, kissing the Son is higher than keeping the law.</P><P>I think that David's devotion to the law in Psalm 1 was higher than our devotion to Christ. This is because he said that he meditated in the law day and night. Do we meditate on Christ day and night? If we meditate on Christ for a short time, we think this is wonderful, but David meditated in the law day and night.</P><P>I am sharing this to show us that we secretly, unconsciously, and subconsciously hold our natural concept in coming to the Bible. This is why we do not receive the revelation from the Bible into us. Instead, we insert our concept into the Bible. We should not exalt the keeping of the law, because the book of Psalms itself does not go along with this. If we are exalting the keeping of the law in Psalm 1, we are then confronted with Psalm 2. Psalm 2 is God's speaking, God's declaration, concerning Christ as the center of His economy. He declares, "I have installed My King/Upon Zion, My holy mountain" (v. 6). This is not ordinary speaking, but a declaration and a proclamation.</P><P>God proclaimed to all His people that He had installed His King upon Mount Zion, not Mount Sinai. These two mountains&#151;Mount Zion and Mount Sinai&#151;are very significant. Hebrews 12 says that we have not come to Mount Sinai but to Mount Zion (vv. 18-22). Mount Sinai was the place where the law was given, and Mount Zion is the place where Christ is today in the heavens in His ascension.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
