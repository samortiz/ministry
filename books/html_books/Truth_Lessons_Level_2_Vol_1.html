<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament. In this lesson we will begin with the first covenant that God made with man (Gen. 2:8-9, 15-17), that is, the covenant that God made with the created man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was Jehovah God. The name Jehovah stresses God&rsquo;s relationship with man. Therefore, speaking concerning God&rsquo;s relationship with man, in Genesis 2 the Bible begins to use the name Jehovah. This name means &ldquo;He who was, who is, and who will be,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He who existed, who exists, and who will exist.&rdquo; This means that He always is and never changes, He always exists and never passes away, and He is self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). He is the &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; the One who always is; He is always everything to man. Whatever man needs, He is. He is well able to meet all of man&rsquo;s needs. Such a One who always is, who is without beginning and without end, and who always exists and never passes away, came to make a covenant with the created man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was God. The Hebrew word for God is Elohim, which means the mighty One who is faithful. This shows that God is a mighty One, even a mighty One who is faithful to keep His word. His faithfulness is the guarantee of the covenant that He made with man; His might enables Him to fulfill His covenant with man. It is such a mighty and faithful One who came to make a covenant with man. Furthermore, the word God here in Genesis 2 is plural, indicating that although He is the only God, He has the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Such a Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, came to make a covenant with the man whom He created, that He might dispense Himself into the created man to be his life and life supply for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;<br />
THE CREATED MAN</h2>
<p>The one with whom the covenant was made, the created man, was created by God in His image and after His likeness to express God and represent God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being without God&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>When man was created, although he had the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26), he did not have God&rsquo;s life in him. God did not put His uncreated life into man; therefore, what man had was but the created life. Hence, the created man still needed to receive the uncreated divine life from God that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose might be accomplished in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being without Sin</h2>
<p>Although man did not have God&rsquo;s life, neither did he have sin&mdash;he was upright (Eccl. 7:29). When man first came out of God&rsquo;s creating hand, he was not crooked, evil, or defiled, but upright, good, and clean. At that time he was without sin, without corruption, and without defect; hence, God considered man very good (Gen. 1:31).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having a Spirit</h2>
<p>Although man did not have the divine life, he did have a spirit within him (Job 32:8). The spirit of man was specifically formed by God as the deepest part in the entire being of the created man; it is the receiver for man to receive God and an organ for man to contact God and all the spiritual things, in order that man may substantiate the things of God and the spiritual things. Zechariah 12:1 says that Jehovah &ldquo;stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&rdquo; This indicates that the spirit of man ranks with the heavens and the earth. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit within him to contact God and to contain God that God may enter into him to be his life and life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Having a Free Will</h2>
<p>Although God did not put His life into man, He created man with a free will that man might exercise his own will to choose Him and to obtain His life. Therefore, He placed man in front of the tree of life, and He also set the tree of the knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life, thus affording man the opportunity to make a choice. Man could either choose God, who was signified by the tree of life, or he could choose Satan, who was signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God allowed man to exercise free will to choose for himself that which he thought was good. God desired that man would voluntarily and willingly choose Him and take Him as his life and content.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Assigned to Dress and Guard<br />
the Garden of God</h2>
<p>After man was created, God did not require him to do anything; He assigned him only to dress and to guard His garden on earth (Gen. 2:15). To dress here means to cultivate or to till the ground. Man was charged to dress the garden of God, that is, to cultivate the garden of God so that it might not be ruined. Man was also charged to guard the ground, to protect the garden from God&rsquo;s enemy, that is, to deal with Satan by God&rsquo;s authority that the garden might not be damaged.</p>
<p>It was with such a man who was without sin, who had a spirit and a free will, and who was assigned to dress and guard His garden, that God made the first covenant with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. God Desiring Man to Receive the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to work Himself into man, whom He created, to be man&rsquo;s life and content that He may have a corporate expression. Hence, after man was created, God put him in front of the tree of life and commanded him, saying that he could freely eat of every tree of the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:16-17). This indicates that God desired and longed for man to receive His life, signified by the tree of life, that His eternal intention might be accomplished.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Tree of Life Signifying God<br />
as the Source of Life</h2>
<p>The tree of life is a symbol, signifying God as the source of life. This matter is clearly revealed in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John tells us that in Him (Christ) was life (1:4), that He came that man might have life (10:10), that He is life (11:25), and that He is the unique true vine in the universe (15:1). This clearly indicates that Christ is the tree of life. Furthermore, Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). Hence, the tree of life in Genesis 2 signifies God as the source of life. Its content is life, and its nature and result also are life. Everything pertaining to it is life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Man Needing to Receive by Eating</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s way for man to take the tree of life is by eating. Hence, God placed man in front of the tree of life and strongly commanded man to pay attention to his eating because eating is a matter of life and death (Gen. 2:16-17). Eating issues in a union and a mingling. It is not merely an outward objective contact but an inward subjective receiving. If man eats properly, he receives God into him subjectively to be joined and mingled with him, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God Wanting Man to Reject the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>Besides the tree of life, there was also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:9b). God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he would eat of it he would surely die (Gen. 2:17). This indicates that God wanted man to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and to receive the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />
Signifying Satan as the Source of Sin and Death</h2>
<p>There are two sources in the universe: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life signifies God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and death. Just as God&rsquo;s life is the content of the tree of life, so also Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature are the contents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. After Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, sin entered into the world through him (Rom. 5:12). Actually, sin is the embodiment of Satan, the evil one. Furthermore, death came through sin, and Satan was the one who had the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Hence, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and death; it includes good, evil, and knowledge. If man were to contact it, he would touch the source of sin and death, and this would surely issue in sin and death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Man Being Able Also to Receive by Eating</h2>
<p>Just as man could receive the tree of life by eating, so also he could receive the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by eating. Hence, in this covenant, God especially warned man to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest the evil, poisonous element of Satan enter into man and be joined and mingled with man, thus damaging the upright and pure man whom God created for His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT</h2>
<p>Although God longed that man would take the tree of life by eating, man acted contrary to God&rsquo;s covenant and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, receiving Satan&rsquo;s evil essence into his body. This is the greatest tragedy in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Man Eating the Tree of the Knowledge<br />
of Good and Evil</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Because of the Temptation of the Serpent&mdash;Satan</h2>
<p>Because of the serpent&rsquo;s temptation, man violated God&rsquo;s covenant and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent, the tempter, was the incarnation of Satan. Satan hid himself in the crafty serpent to tempt and deceive man, causing man, on the one hand, to doubt God&rsquo;s word (Gen. 3:1, 4) and, on the other hand, to doubt God&rsquo;s heart (Gen. 3:5). He caused man to think that because God was afraid that man would be like Him, knowing good and evil, He lied to man and prohibited man from eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result, man was deceived by the serpent and cheated by Satan. Thus man misunderstood God&rsquo;s love, doubted God&rsquo;s heart, ignored God&rsquo;s word, and thereby ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Receiving Satan</h2>
<p>After man was tempted by the serpent and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he received Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature into his body; that is, he received Satan. Hence, man became a child of the Devil (John 8:44; 1 John 3:8). Being subjected under Satan&rsquo;s authority and obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2), man became a son of disobedience. He was blinded by Satan in his mind and could not see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4). Moreover, he lay under Satan&rsquo;s hand (1 John 5:19b), being oppressed and controlled by Satan, being slaughtered as Satan pleased, and having no freedom. This was the pitiful and tragic condition of man after he acted contrary to God&rsquo;s covenant to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby receive Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Having Sin and Death</h2>
<p>After man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and received Satan, he had sin and death. As Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men....&rdquo; Sin entered into man and dwelt in man&rsquo;s body (Rom. 7:17), causing man&rsquo;s body to become damaged and transmuted into the flesh (Gen. 3:7; Rom. 6:6; 7:18). Thus sin reigned (Rom. 5:21) in the fallen man, lorded it over him (Rom. 6:14), tempted him, and killed him (Rom. 7:11). Moreover, sin dwelt in man, causing man to do things against his own will (Rom. 7:17, 20). Sin is living (Rom. 7:9) and is very active. Hence, it must be the incarnation of the evil one, Satan, living, walking, and reigning in the fallen man. At the same time, death came through sin (Rom. 5:12), and the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23a). Therefore, the wages that man earned for his sin was death. First his spirit was deadened, and then his body also died. Thus, when man violated God&rsquo;s covenant and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he had sin and death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man Being Driven out of the Garden of Eden<br />
and Kept Away from the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Having been seduced by the serpent, man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, received Satan, and had sin and death. Hence, man was driven out of the Garden of Eden and was kept away from the tree of life. Since there was a charge of sin against man before God and there was also the nature of sin in man himself, if man had eaten of the fruit of the tree of life, he would have lived forever with his sinful nature. God could never allow such a thing to happen. The tree of life, signifying God, must not be touched by the sinful man. Thus, before the redemption of Christ was accomplished, God had to close the way to the tree of life. Therefore, the result of man&rsquo;s fall was that he was driven out of the Garden of Eden and was kept away from the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Kept Away by the Cherubim&mdash;God&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>After man was driven out of the Garden of Eden, God caused the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every way to guard the way of the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5). The way to the tree of life being closed by the cherubim means that it was closed by God&rsquo;s glory. Since man had sinned and come short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23), God closed the way to the tree of life by His glory, not allowing any sinful person, who was short of His glory, to contact Him.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Kept Away by the Flame&mdash;God&rsquo;s Holiness</h2>
<p>Fire in the Bible always refers to the holiness of God. Because God is a consuming fire (Deut. 4:24; 9:3; Heb. 12:29), anything common, unclean, or sinful is consumed by Him (Lev. 10). After man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and received the things that are apart from God, he became unholy, worldly, and common. Hence, God must guard the way to the tree of life by His holiness, not allowing sinful man to come near to Him lest he be consumed by the fire of His holiness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Kept Away by the Sword&mdash;God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2>
<p>The third item that guarded the way of the tree of life was the sword. The sword signifies God&rsquo;s righteous killing. The sword in Genesis 3 indicates that to be killed is the punishment meted out to the sinner by God&rsquo;s righteousness (Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5). Since God is righteous, He cannot consider a sinful one as one who is without sin. Since man was sinful, God had to inflict a penalty, and His penalty was to kill man. Therefore, God&rsquo;s guarding the tree of life with the sword means that God&rsquo;s righteousness would not allow the fallen sinner to contact the tree of life; otherwise, man would be smitten by the sword of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>Thus, because of man&rsquo;s fall, God drove man out of the Garden of Eden and placed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life. That is, He closed the way to the tree of life by His glory, holiness, and righteousness, keeping man away from the tree of life and not allowing the fallen sinner to contact Him and obtain Him as life. It was not until the accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, that the way to the tree of life was opened once again.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament. The first covenant which God made with man was a covenant that God made with the created man. The One who made this covenant was Jehovah God, the One who always is and the mighty One who is faithful. The one with whom the covenant was made was the created man who was without God&rsquo;s life and without sin, but who had a spirit and a free will and who was assigned to dress and guard the garden of God. God made a covenant with him that by eating he should receive the tree of life, which signifies God as the source of life, so that God might enter into him to be joined and mingled with him, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man. Furthermore, God wanted man to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan as the source of sin and death, lest Satan&rsquo;s evil, poisonous element should enter into man, thus damaging the upright and pure man whom God created for His eternal purpose. Eventually, man acted contrary to God&rsquo;s covenant and, having been deceived by the serpent (the Devil), ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus receiving Satan and having sin and death. Hence, man was driven out of the Garden of Eden and was kept away from the tree of life, that is, kept away by the cherubim, which signify God&rsquo;s glory, by the flame, which signifies God&rsquo;s holiness, and by the sword, which signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness. It was not until the accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, that the way to the tree of life was opened once again.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, after man&rsquo;s creation, God made the first covenant with man; after man&rsquo;s fall He made the second covenant with man (Gen. 3:8-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Coming to the Place of Fallen Man</h2>
<p>After Adam and Eve disobeyed God&rsquo;s word and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, immediately they knew that they had violated God&rsquo;s prohibition and that the result of their transgression would be death. Therefore, they hid themselves from the presence of God, awaiting the sentence of death. However, instead of forsaking them, God came to the garden, to the place of the fallen people (Gen. 3:8); and instead of sentencing them to death, He preached the gospel to them. Therefore, Jehovah God came to the place of fallen man to make a covenant with man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Seeking and Calling Fallen Man</h2>
<p>God not only came to the place of fallen man, but He came to seek and to call fallen man. He spoke to them in the way of seeking and calling, saying, &ldquo;Where art thou?&rdquo; (Gen. 3:9). Hence, Jehovah, the One who made the covenant, was such a God who came to the place of fallen man to seek and to call fallen man. Man&rsquo;s fall did not cause God to give up His purpose in man. Since His will is established, it will never change. Many years later, God Himself became a man, the Lord Jesus, and came to the place of the fallen people to seek and to save us, the fallen and lost ones (Luke 19:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;<br />
FALLEN MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Transgressing God&rsquo;s Prohibition</h2>
<p>While man was in the Garden of Eden, God admonished him, saying, &ldquo;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). God&rsquo;s intention was that man should exercise his free will to choose the tree of life and reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, man transgressed God&rsquo;s prohibition and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, man had an offense before God (Rom. 5:18a), and he also had Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature in him. Thus he became a fallen person.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Sin and Death</h2>
<p>When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan&rsquo;s evil essence entered into man. Hence, within man there was an essence that was not created by God. This essence is the nature of Satan, which is also the sin that dwells in man, as mentioned in the Scriptures (Rom. 7:17), becoming the essence and constituent of fallen man. Therefore, the fallen man had sin and was constituted a sinner (Rom. 5:12, 19).</p>
<p>The fallen man not only had sin and was constituted a sinner, but he also had death and became a dead person (1 Cor. 15:22). First, the fallen man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God; eventually even man&rsquo;s body died. Therefore, through the offense of one man, Adam, sin entered into the world, and sin brought in death, so death ruled over all men (Rom. 5:12, 17), causing all men to die. Although man fell into such a tragic and hopeless condition, God came to visit him and to make a covenant with him.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>After man&rsquo;s fall, there was a great change in man: man had the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:22a). Both the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil came from the same tree, the same source, which is Satan as the source of sin and death, causing man not to depend on God but to be independent of God. Because the contents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are all things apart from God, its nature is death, its principle is independence, and, surely, its ultimate result is man&rsquo;s separation from God and the bringing in of death. Therefore, having the knowledge of good and evil, fallen man departed from God and walked on the way of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Knowing His Nakedness</h2>
<p>Before the fall man, being innocent, was not ashamed of his nakedness (Gen. 2:25). It was not until man committed sin and became fallen that he became aware of his nakedness (Gen. 3:7); that is, he knew his sinfulness and shamefulness. The moment sin entered, the first result was that man saw his nakedness and immediately felt shameful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Making Skirts of Leaves to Cover the Shame</h2>
<p>After the fall man felt the shame of his nakedness and tried to make skirts of leaves to cover the shame. The fig leaf skirts represent man&rsquo;s own work in covering himself as a sinful one, that is, man&rsquo;s own attempt to hide, to cover by his own work, the shame of his sinfulness. However, since the skirts made of fig leaves would have withered, broken, and soon dropped off, they could not cover his nakedness in the eyes of God. Therefore, it was not possible for fallen man to cover the shame of his nakedness by his own work or his own behavior.</p>
<p>It was with such a man who transgressed God&rsquo;s prohibition, who had sin and death, who had the knowledge of good and evil, and who knew his nakedness and made skirts of leaves to cover the shame, that God made the second covenant with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Serpent Being Cursed</h2>
<p>The first item of this covenant was that the serpent was cursed. God said to the serpent, &ldquo;Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life&rdquo; (Gen. 3:14). This curse included two matters. The first matter was that the serpent was to creep on its belly, which was to limit its sphere of activity and move, allowing it to creep only on the earth. The second matter was that the serpent was limited to eat only dust, and dust became the serpent&rsquo;s food. Therefore, in this covenant, on the one hand, God limited the realm of Satan&rsquo;s move and devouring, and on the other hand, He warned the man whom He had made from dust that if he would continue to live in an earthly manner, he would fall into the sphere of Satan&rsquo;s work and would be devoured by him. However, if man would take God&rsquo;s way of redemption and live in fellowship with God, he would be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s authority and not be devoured by Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Seed of the Woman to Come</h2>
<p>While God was cursing the serpent, He also spoke a wonderful promise: &ldquo;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed&rdquo; (Gen. 3:15a). Here God promised that the seed of the woman was to come. This seed of the woman is the Lord Jesus. He was born of the virgin Mary, and He was the only One among the human race who was born of a woman only (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23; Gal. 4:4). Thus, He is truly the seed of the woman, the very seed promised by God to man in Genesis 3:15, to be the Savior to fallen man and, on behalf of man, to destroy Satan, who seduced and harmed man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Seed of the Woman<br />
to Destroy the Serpent&mdash;the Devil</h2>
<p>In this covenant God also promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15b), that is, cause its death. The Lord Jesus, the seed of the woman, came in order to destroy the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8). Therefore, when He was carrying out His ministry on earth, He frequently cast out demons, who were under the authority of Satan, from the possessed people (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) that they might be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Luke 13:16). When He was on the cross, through death He bruised the head of the ancient serpent, destroying the Devil who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14) and ruining him completely. Thus, He fulfilled the covenant which God made with fallen man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Woman to Suffer in Childbearing<br />
and to Be Ruled by the Husband</h2>
<p>In this covenant God also required the woman to suffer in childbearing and to be ruled by the husband. God said to the woman, &ldquo;I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee&rdquo; (Gen. 3:16, ASV). The entire process of childbearing, including pregnancy, delivery, and child-rearing, is a suffering to a woman. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement for the good of the woman, that by being restricted she might be protected and may thus be prevented from falling further. Furthermore, God arranged especially that the desire of the woman&rsquo;s heart would be to her husband and that the woman would be ruled by her husband. Such an arrangement by God was for the good of the woman that she might be restricted and protected.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Man to Labor and Sweat<br />
until He Should Return to the Ground</h2>
<p>In this covenant God also required the man to labor and sweat until he should return to the ground. To the man God said, &ldquo;Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee...in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground&rdquo; (Gen. 3:17-19, ASV). Here the ground denotes the job or profession on which man depends for his existence. In the whole earth there is not one job or profession that is without hardship. In every occupation it is easy for &ldquo;thorns&rdquo; and &ldquo;thistles&rdquo; to grow from the &ldquo;ground.&rdquo; Thus, man must toil and sweat during his entire life in order to exist. In His arrangements for both the woman and the man God ordained that fallen man should suffer. God uses suffering to restrict man that fallen man may have security and protection; He also uses suffering to constrain man that man may turn to Him and receive deliverance through the seed of the woman. Furthermore, God also ordained that man should not live forever, but that he should die, returning to the ground (Gen. 3:19). Therefore, death is also a restriction that God has placed over fallen man that man may not do evil endlessly and thereby affect the existence of the human race.</p>
<p>After man&rsquo;s fall, God immediately came to make a covenant with man, giving man the promise of redemption and using suffering to restrict and protect man that the existence of the human race might be preserved until the coming of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Adam Calling His Wife&rsquo;s Name Eve</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Believing in God&rsquo;s Covenant</h2>
<p>After they had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve knew that they would surely die. Hence, they were trembling in fear, awaiting death. However, instead of sentencing them to death, God gave them a wonderful promise, that the seed of the woman was to come. After Adam heard this word, he immediately called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve (Gen. 3:20), which means &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;life&rdquo; in Hebrew. He believed that he and Eve were going to live and not die. This indicates that he believed what was promised in God&rsquo;s covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having the Hope of Life by Faith</h2>
<p>By faith Adam received what was promised in God&rsquo;s covenant. Thus he had the hope of life. Originally he thought that he would surely die and that there was no possibility to have any hope of life. However, when he heard that the woman would have a seed, he knew that he was going to live and not die. Therefore, by faith he had the hope of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God Making Coats of Skins for Adam and Eve</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Skins of the Sacrifice Signifying Christ<br />
as the Righteousness of the Believers</h2>
<p>Since Adam believed in what was promised in God&rsquo;s covenant, God made coats of the skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them. The skins of the sacrifice signify Christ, who died for sinners, as the righteousness of those who believe. Christ is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). This Lamb was foreordained before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:18-20) and was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). Hence, there in the Garden of Eden we can see a picture of the shedding of Christ&rsquo;s blood. On the cross Christ was killed by the righteous God, shedding His precious blood to satisfy the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness upon man (Rom. 5:9). Hence, God can cover the believing ones with Him as their righteousness. Therefore, Adam experienced God&rsquo;s anticipated redemption in the Garden of Eden. The skins of sacrifice that were put on him signified Christ as the righteousness of the believing ones.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Fallen Sinners Being Justified by God</h2>
<p>When God clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of the sacrifice, He clothed them with Christ as their righteousness to cover them completely. This means that they were justified by God, that is, they were covered by God&rsquo;s righteousness. Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness covered them that they, the fallen sinners, might be justified and accepted by God and have fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Abel Taking God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Believing in the Word Preached by His Father</h2>
<p>After they had children, Adam and Eve must have told them how they had fallen and how God had killed the sacrifice, using the skins to make robes to cover their nakedness that they could be in the presence of God and have fellowship with Him. Abel believed in his parents&rsquo; preaching. Evidence of this is found in Hebrews 11:4 which says, &ldquo;By faith Abel offered to God a...sacrifice....&rdquo; Such faith must have issued from the word preached by his parents, for faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ (Rom. 10:17). Hence, by believing in the word preached by his father, Abel received the way of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Offering the Sacrifice with the Shedding<br />
of Blood and Being Accepted by God</h2>
<p>Abel was a feeder of sheep, working and living for God. Moreover, by faith he presented to God a sacrifice with the shedding of blood as an offering and was accepted by God. He presented the firstlings of his flock and their fat, and God had regard for him and his offering (Gen. 4:2, 4). He did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God&rsquo;s way of redemption. He knew that he had been born of fallen parents and that he was evil, sinful, and defiled in the eyes of God. He needed an offering with the shedding of blood in order to satisfy the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Hence, he offered the firstlings of his flock and their fat. When he offered the fat, the sacrifice was killed and the blood was shed. The shedding of blood was for his redemption, and the burning of fat was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Thus, by offering to God the sacrifice with the shedding of blood, he was accepted by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Cain Rejecting God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Presenting Produce without the Shedding<br />
of Blood and Being Rejected by God</h2>
<p>Cain was presumptuous in that he forsook God&rsquo;s way of redemption and presented produce without the shedding of blood as an offering to God. Hence, he was rejected by God (Gen. 4:3, 5). Like Abel, he was born of fallen parents and he was sinful, evil, and defiled. Adam and Eve must have told Cain how they fell and how God covered them with the skins of the sacrifice. However, Cain forsook God&rsquo;s way of redemption and refused God&rsquo;s method. According to his own idea and opinion, he offered produce without the shedding of blood. Thus, his offering was an insult to God and an abomination. Therefore, God rejected it.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Killing Abel and Being Cast Out<br />
of the Presence of God</h2>
<p>When Cain saw that God was pleased with Abel but not with him, he became jealous and very angry and his countenance fell. Then he even rose up against Abel his brother and killed him (Gen. 4:5, 8). In the beginning Cain worshipped God; then he became jealous, angry, and hateful, and eventually he committed murder. He even lied to God and was arrogant (Gen. 4:9). As a result, he was cast out of the presence of God (Gen. 4:14, 16) and produced a culture that corrupted his descendants and that was judged by God. This was a culture without God. It included building a city for self-existence, inventing cattle-raising for making a living, inventing music for self-amusement, and inventing weapons for self-defense (Gen. 4:17, 20-22). Eventually, in the generation of Noah this culture had developed to such an extent that the entire world was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. Hence, they were judged by God with the flood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, after man&rsquo;s creation, God made the first covenant with man; after man&rsquo;s fall He came to the place of fallen man to seek and to call fallen man. It was with such a man who transgressed God&rsquo;s prohibition, who had sin and death, who had the knowledge of good and evil, and who knew his nakedness and made skirts of leaves to cover the shame, that God made the second covenant with man. In this covenant God cursed the serpent, restricting it so that it would creep only on the earth and that it would eat dust during its entire life. He also promised that the seed of the woman, Christ, would come to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, that is, to cause Satan&rsquo;s death. Finally, He required the woman to suffer in childbearing and to be ruled by the husband, and He required the man to labor and sweat until he should return to the ground so that fallen man, being restricted by suffering, would have security and protection and would turn to God to receive deliverance through the seed of the woman. Eventually, Adam believed in what was promised in God&rsquo;s covenant and called his wife Eve, meaning &ldquo;living&rdquo; or &ldquo;life.&rdquo; By faith he also had the hope of life. Then God made coats of skins for them that fallen sinners, having been justified by God through Christ, might be accepted by God and have fellowship with Him. By faith Abel received God&rsquo;s way of redemption, offering the sacrifice with the shedding of blood and being accepted by God. However, Cain refused God&rsquo;s way of redemption, offering produce without the shedding of blood. Rejected by God, he killed Abel his brother and was cast out of the presence of God, producing a culture that corrupted his descendants and that was judged by God.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After God judged the corrupt generation by the flood and saved Noah out of that generation, He made the third covenant with man (Gen. 9:1-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;GOD</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was God. Here &ldquo;God&rdquo; in Hebrew is Elohim, which is composed of two words, the first word meaning &ldquo;the powerful One,&rdquo; and the second word meaning &ldquo;binding Himself with an oath.&rdquo; Oath-making shows God&rsquo;s faithfulness; power indicates God&rsquo;s might. This God who made the covenant is the mighty One who is faithful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Faithful One</h2>
<p>God is faithful, and by His faithfulness He made a covenant with Noah. His faithfulness is established in heaven; it cannot be touched or altered by anything on earth. Therefore, God can never be faithless, nor suffer His faithfulness to fail, nor break His covenant which He made with man, nor alter the word that He spoke to man (Psa. 89:33-34). If man becomes faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself (2 Tim. 2:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Mighty One</h2>
<p>God is also mighty, and by His might He made a covenant with Noah. His might guarantees that every word in His covenant will and can be fulfilled. He has the power to fulfill the covenant which He made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM<br />
THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;NOAH</h2>
<p>The one with whom this covenant was made was Noah, who was a righteous man, a perfect man who walked with God in that corrupt generation, and a herald of righteousness. He built the ark to save himself and his entire family, and he was saved through water, being delivered from that corrupt generation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Righteous Man</h2>
<p>Noah was a righteous man. This means that he was right with God, with others, and with himself. Because he believed in God, his believing was immediately reckoned to him by God as righteousness; that is, he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith (Heb. 11:7). Moreover, because he found grace in the eyes of God, this grace strengthened him and helped him to live a righteous life. Therefore, he not only received objective righteousness but also lived out subjective righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Perfect Man Who Walked with God</h2>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s generation had become a corrupt generation. A number of the fallen angels in Satan&rsquo;s principality came down to the earth, took human bodies, and formed illegal marriages with the daughters of men, producing a mingling of the evil spirits and human beings. No longer was the human race merely the human race; it became a mixture of humanity and fallen spirits. Thus the entire generation became a corrupt generation. God saw the earth, that all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth (Gen. 6:12).</p>
<p>However, in that corrupt generation, Noah was a perfect man who walked with God (Gen. 6:9). His walking with God means that he did not override God, that he was not presumptuous, that he did not do things according to his own concept and desire, and that he did things according to God and with God. Hence, he became a perfect man. Without God, man is not perfect and is still lacking. The factor of perfection is not with man; it is God Himself. It was with such a perfect man who walked with Him that God made a covenant.</p><h2 class="head2">C. A Herald of Righteousness</h2>
<p>Noah was also a herald of righteousness (2 Pet. 2:5). Nothing was righteous in his generation, and the earth was filled with violence and corruption. When God told Noah that He was going to destroy all men with the earth, Noah rose up to preach God&rsquo;s righteousness in opposition to the corruption of his generation, telling the people to get right with God, with others, and with themselves or else God&rsquo;s righteous judgment would come upon them. Because he preached righteousness and lived a righteous life to protest against the unrighteous, ungodly, and evil generation, he was spared from God&rsquo;s governmental judgment according to God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. One Who Built the Ark to Save Himself</h2>
<p>While Noah was preaching righteousness, he was also building the ark. He built the ark by faith (Heb. 11:7) and also according to God&rsquo;s revelation (Gen. 6:14-22). He did not construct it according to tradition or his own concept, but, believing in God and practicing God&rsquo;s revelation, he constructed it absolutely according to God&rsquo;s revelation. During that period of time, he must have experienced a great deal of opposition, criticism, mockery, and condemnation. No one besides his family appreciated the work of building the ark. That work was unique and strange, and in human eyes it was impractical. However, when God&rsquo;s judgment came, the ark saved him out of that judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. One Who Was Saved through Water</h2>
<p>Not only was Noah saved from God&rsquo;s judgment through the ark, but he was also saved from that corrupt generation through water (1 Pet. 3:20) into a new age, just as the children of Israel were saved by the water of the Red Sea (Exo. 14:22, 29; 1 Cor. 10:1-2) and the New Testament believers are saved by the water of baptism (1 Pet. 3:21). The flood that God used to execute His judgment upon that evil age saved Noah from that age. Hence, Noah enjoyed a double salvation. On the one hand, by faith he entered into the ark and was saved from God&rsquo;s judging flood through the ark; on the other hand, he passed through the flood in the ark and was saved, through the water of the flood, out of the condemned world into a renewed world.</p>
<p>Thus, it was with Noah, a righteous man, a perfect man who walked with God, one who preached righteousness, one who built the ark to save himself, and one who was saved through water, that God made the third covenant with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BASIS FOR MAKING THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Covenant before the Judgment<br />
of the Flood</h2>
<p>Before the human race was judged by the flood, God made a covenant with Noah (Gen. 6:18&mdash;7:5) that his family of eight should enter into the ark and that he should bring some of every living thing into the ark to keep them alive and thereby keep seed alive upon the earth. It was because of this covenant that, after God&rsquo;s judgment of destruction, man and all living things were kept alive and God&rsquo;s purpose for man could be maintained. This covenant may be considered the basis upon which God made a further covenant with Noah after the world was destroyed by the flood. After the flood, based on the covenant prior to the flood, God made the present covenant with Noah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man Taking God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2>
<p>After he came out of the ark, Noah first built an altar to Jehovah and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar (Gen. 8:20). He did more than Abel in that he not only offered sacrifices but also built an altar. Building an altar and offering sacrifices signify the offering of Christ through the cross. This indicates that Noah took God&rsquo;s way of redemption by presenting the offerings, which signify Christ, to satisfy the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness and to be accepted by God. This was the effective basis upon which God made a covenant with Noah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Sweet Savor<br />
Issuing from the Burnt Offerings</h2>
<p>After Noah built an altar and offered the burnt offerings, Jehovah God smelled the sweet savor and said in His heart, &ldquo;I will not again curse the ground any more for man&rsquo;s sake...neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done&rdquo; (Gen. 8:21). This is because the burnt offering signifies Christ as God&rsquo;s pleasure, and those who believe in Him, through their union with Him, are also accepted by God in Him (Lev. 1:1-17; Heb. 10:5-7). Hence, the sweet savor issuing from the burnt offerings brought satisfaction to God. Before the flood, the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, so that it repented Jehovah that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart (Gen. 6:5-6). However, here was a man who offered burnt offerings according to God&rsquo;s pleasure and was accepted by God, making God happy and satisfied. Hence, God came to make a covenant with man to preserve the earth and the order of all things related to the earth that man might be kept alive and that He might use man to fulfill the economy of His intention.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Man to Be Fruitful, Multiply,<br />
and Replenish the Earth</h2>
<p>In the covenant which He made with Noah and his sons, God first told them to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth. When God created man, He blessed man, telling him to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth that the whole earth might be filled with beautiful faces expressing God. However, man fell repeatedly, and eventually he came under God&rsquo;s judgment and was destroyed by the flood. Now that God had saved Noah&rsquo;s family of eight through water and had brought them into a new age, He made another covenant with man and He blessed man in order to continue the purpose of His creation of man, telling man to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth that man might be brought back to His original intention and that His will might be accomplished in the man who was saved through water.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man to Have Dominion<br />
over All Living Creatures</h2>
<p>In this covenant God also charged man to have dominion over every living creature of the heavens, of the earth, and of the sea (Gen. 9:2). This was the authority that God gave to man when He first created him, that man might represent Him to exercise His authority over the earth. However, man lost this position because of his fall. Now God made a covenant again with the man who had been saved through water; He restored man&rsquo;s authority and committed all living things into man&rsquo;s hand. Hence, man was brought back to his original position, having the authority to represent God and to rule over all things for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Man Being Allowed to Take Animals for Food<br />
but Not to Eat Blood</h2>
<p>Before the flood God ordained that man should eat only herbs and fruits of the trees (Gen. 1:29), that is, that he should eat vegetables and not meat. However, after the flood, God ordained that animals, as well as vegetables, may also be man&rsquo;s food (Gen. 9:3). God&rsquo;s intention was that the man who was saved through water should know that he was fallen and that he needed redemption with the shedding of blood to maintain his life. In the Bible, meat, as food for the maintenance of life, comes from the slaying of an animal, and it signifies Christ being slain that we may have life and be kept alive. Therefore, meat signifies redemption with the shedding of blood; vegetables signify works without blood. Before the fall, man could maintain his life by merely eating vegetables, signifying that in his innocent state man could live in the presence of God by his works. However, after the fall, man became sinful, so he needed the redemption with the shedding of blood that he might live in the presence of God. Therefore, as a symbol of this matter, God told man to eat meat.</p>
<p>Although He ordained man to eat meat, God did not allow man to eat blood, for it is the blood, by reason of the life, that makes atonement for man&rsquo;s life (Lev. 17:10-11). However, when the Lord Jesus came, He said that His blood was drinkable, for His blood truly can redeem us from sins that we may receive His life (John 6:53-56; Matt. 26:27-28). Therefore, in type, blood makes atonement for man and should not be eaten by man. However, in reality, no blood, except the blood of the Lord Jesus, can take away man&rsquo;s sins (Heb. 9:12; 10:4). Therefore, no blood should be eaten except the blood of the Lord Jesus. For this reason God forbids man to eat blood. This is to show forth the matter of redemption with the shedding of blood. On the one hand, it indicates that the blood is to make atonement for man; on the other hand, it indicates that no blood, except the blood of the Lord Jesus, can truly take away man&rsquo;s sins. Therefore, man must receive the blood of the Lord Jesus and depend on it in order that he may have life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. God Giving Man the Authority over Others</h2>
<p>Genesis 9:6 says, &ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.&rdquo; This verse indicates that God&rsquo;s giving man the authority over other men was the beginning of human government. Originally, apart from the husband being the head over his wife, God had not given man authority over others. Rather, He had given man authority only over the creatures, whereas men were all directly under God. When man fell out of God&rsquo;s direct government, he came under the rule of his own conscience, that is, under self-government, to maintain his human life. Because of man&rsquo;s continual fall, the government of the conscience became a failure. Eventually, the whole earth was filled with violence so that God destroyed the human race by the flood, preserving only Noah&rsquo;s family of eight. After the flood, man was to live a new life on the earth. Thus God set up His deputy authority, placing man under the authority of others to be governed by man in order to maintain the existence and order of the human race. Hence, Noah became the head of a new race. God gave him authority not only over creatures other than man, but also over the lawless man.</p><h2 class="head2">E. God No More to Destroy the Earth by a Flood</h2>
<p>Although Noah&rsquo;s household of eight persons came out of the ark, they must still have been fearful, not knowing whether God would again destroy the earth and man and all living creatures upon it by the waters of a flood, whether God would again allow them to encounter such a terrible catastrophe. Although they were saved, they were still afraid in their hearts. Hence, God came to make a covenant with them. He spoke to Noah and his sons, saying, &ldquo;I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you...neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 9:8-11). In this covenant God said repeatedly that there would not be a flood anymore in order to take away Noah and his family&rsquo;s fear, that they might hold on to the word of the covenant and have peace because of the covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. God Using the Rainbow as a Sign<br />
of His Faithfulness in Keeping the Covenant</h2>
<p>God set the rainbow in the cloud as a token of the covenant which He made with man (Gen. 9:12-17). The rainbow signifies God&rsquo;s faithfulness. God&rsquo;s faithfulness remains forever, for He cannot deny Himself (2 Tim. 2:13). Moreover, God Himself is faithfulness (1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:9). Once He has spoken, He keeps His word. He must be faithful to His word, and His covenant is His word, even His word spoken with an oath. Hence, God used the rainbow as a sign of His faithfulness in keeping the covenant. Whenever a cloud covers the earth, the rainbow is seen in the cloud. God&rsquo;s faithfulness is the guarantee that God will keep His covenant and that a flood will no more come to destroy man. At the time spoken of in Revelation when God will judge the earth with its inhabitants, there will still be a rainbow around the throne (Rev. 4:3), indicating that when He will execute His judgment upon the earth, He will still remember the covenant He made with Noah and will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep some to be the nations on the earth to fulfill His purpose for His glory (Rev. 21:24, 26).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Earth Being Preserved</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s making a covenant with the man who was saved through water resulted in the earth being preserved and the blessing being brought to the earth. Genesis 8:22 mentions eight items of the blessing, including seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night. The seedtime is the time of sowing the seed; the harvest is the reaping. The seedtime is the beginning, and the harvest is the consummation, the maturity. In the process there is the need of cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night in order that the crop may grow and man&rsquo;s life be maintained. The perpetual cycle of seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night is God&rsquo;s guarantee that the order of the universe will continue to be maintained by the different cycles in regularity without end. This covenant guarantees the preservation of the earth and the growth of all kinds of living things. Thus, man may multiply endlessly and replenish the earth to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man Abusing the Fourth Item of the Covenant</h2>
<p>Although God was faithful to keep His covenant and bestowed His love on man according to His covenant, man abused the fourth item of the covenant, misused the God-given authority to form nations, exalted himself to oppose God, fell into idolatry, and was scattered abroad by God upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Misusing the God-given Authority<br />
to Form Nations</h2>
<p>Although God gave man the authority to rule over others, He did not intend for man to form nations; His intention was that there might be peace among men. However, man misused this authority to form nations on the earth. The forming of nations was the work of Satan. Satan caused man to misuse the God-given authority to form nations on the earth. The most well-known was that of Nimrod. As a mighty one on the earth (Gen. 10:8), Nimrod was the first to be a king, or the first to form a kingdom. The first kingdom in human history was probably the kingdom of Babel formed by Nimrod (Gen. 10:10). He began to misuse the God-given authority to make himself the king, to rule over others, and to form a kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Exalting Himself to Oppose God</h2>
<p>Human government was of God&rsquo;s authorization. However, Satan caused man to misuse the God-given authority to form nations and instigated man to rebel against God with the nations. Man rose up to exalt himself in opposition to God, even falling into an open rebellion against God, that is, the whole human race rebelling collectively against God&rsquo;s right and authority. Before the incident at Babel, there were only individuals opposing God on the earth; men had not reached the extent of organized rebellion. It was at Babel that men began to organize themselves and to join themselves together to rebel against God. They made bricks with the earth by human labor (Gen. 11:3); they built a city to have a man-made, godless life; and, even more, they intended to build a tower that would reach into heaven in order to make themselves a name and to reject, to deny, God&rsquo;s name. Man had exalted himself to oppose God to such an extent.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Falling into Idolatry</h2>
<p>Man not only exalted himself to oppose God but also fell into idolatry. According to evidence found by archeologists and historians, when the city and the tower of Babel were constructed, every brick bore the name of an idol, indicating that the whole human race was worshipping idols. When Terah, the father of Abraham, dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees (Gen. 11:31), he also served idols (Josh. 24:2). In that age, no one paid attention to God, and no one cared for His interest. The whole human race was completely captured by Satan and fell into idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being Scattered Abroad by God<br />
upon the Face of All the Earth</h2>
<p>This fall of man forced God Himself to come out to execute the judgment. In dealing with the prior group of people, the Adamic race, God judged them by the flood; in dealing with this group of people, the descendants of Noah, God Himself came to the earth to judge them directly. God confounded their language that they might not understand one another&rsquo;s speech and thus would be unable to form an alliance; moreover, He scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth (Gen. 10:5, 8-11, 20, 31-32; 11:4, 8-9). At this point, man had fallen to the uttermost so that even God could not do anything to recover the fallen race. Eventually, God was forced to give up the descendants of Noah, the created race of Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After God judged the corrupt generation by the flood and saved Noah&rsquo;s family of eight out of that generation, He made a covenant with Noah, which was the third covenant He made with man. This covenant was made based upon the covenant which God made with Noah before the judgment of the flood. It was also based upon the sweet smell which issued from the burnt offerings presented on the altar built by man in taking God&rsquo;s way of redemption. The contents of the covenant include the following items: man would be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth, have dominion over all living creatures, and be allowed to eat animals for food but not to eat blood; and God would give man the authority over others to maintain the existence and order of the human race, promise to destroy the earth by a flood no more, and use the rainbow as a sign of His faithfulness in keeping the covenant. The result was that the earth was preserved, that all living things were able to grow, and that man was able to multiply endlessly and fill the face of the earth. However, man abused the God-given authority to form nations, exalted himself to oppose God, fell into idolatry, and was scattered abroad by God upon the face of the earth. Eventually, God was forced to give up the descendants of Noah, the created race of Adam.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>When the descendants of Noah violated the covenant that God had made with Noah, forming nations to oppose God and eventually falling into idolatry at Babel, God came to call Abraham as the head of a new race and to make a covenant with him, the fourth covenant that God made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah</h2>
<p>We have said that in making the first covenant Jehovah is the One who was, who is, and who will be. He always is and never changes, and He always exists and never passes away; He is the self-existing and ever-existing One (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). He is the &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; who is well able to meet all the needs of the called one and to be the attraction, encouragement, strength, guidance, support, supply, protection, and care to him in his journey. It was this One who always is who came to make a covenant with the called one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The God of Glory</h2>
<p>Jehovah, the One who made this covenant, is the God of glory. Acts 7:2 says, &ldquo;The God of glory appeared to...Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran.&rdquo; The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel (Exo. 16:10; 24:16-17; Lev. 9:23; Num. 14:10; 16:19; 20:6; Deut. 5:24) and filled the tabernacle and temple (Exo. 40:35; 1 Kings 8:11). God&rsquo;s glory was a great attraction to Abraham. It separated him from the world unto God (Exo. 29:43), and was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4). It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham to make a covenant with him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT<br />
WAS MADE&mdash;ABRAHAM (ABRAM)</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Background</h2>
<p>Abraham was formerly called Abram. When God appeared to him to make a covenant with him, he was in a situation with the darkest background. At that time the human race had fallen to the uttermost. Man abused the God-given authority to form nations, built a city for himself to have a man-made, godless life, built a tower for self-exaltation to oppose God, and fell into a situation of idolatry. Even Abram&rsquo;s father was there serving idols (Josh. 24:2). No one was concerned for God&rsquo;s interest, and no one cared for God&rsquo;s purpose. When Abram was called by God, he was in such a situation with a dark background.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Called to Go Out of Ur</h2>
<p>While Abram was living in Ur, the God of glory suddenly appeared to him, telling him to go out of his land and from his relatives (Acts 7:2-3). Because he lacked boldness, he did not answer God&rsquo;s call immediately. Although God raised up an environment in which, by His sovereign hand, He took away Haran, Abram&rsquo;s brother (Gen. 11:28), Abram still delayed and would not take action. Finally, it was Terah, Abram&rsquo;s father, who brought the whole family out of Ur of Chaldea to go to the land of Canaan (Gen. 11:31). It was in this way that Abram got out of Ur.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Stopping on the Way at Haran</h2>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s sovereign hand caused Terah, Abram&rsquo;s father, to lead the whole family out of Ur toward the land of Canaan, they stopped on the way at Haran (Gen. 11:31-32). Because Abram hesitated again to answer God&rsquo;s call and remained there, God had no choice but to take away his father also (Acts 7:4). Then God appeared to Abram again, calling him to get out not only of his land and from his kindred but also from his father&rsquo;s house (Gen. 12:1-2), and He also made a covenant with him. Thus Abram came into the land of Canaan according to Jehovah&rsquo;s command (Gen. 12:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Time</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. God Telling Him to Get Out of His Country,<br />
from His Kindred, and from His Father&rsquo;s House,<br />
unto a Land That He Would Show Him</h2>
<p>While Abram was staying at Haran, Jehovah told him to get out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father&rsquo;s house unto the land that He would show him. Abram originally lived in Ur of Chaldea. &ldquo;Chaldea&rdquo; means demonic. Chaldea was a demonic place, a place that was fallen, rebellious, and full of idols. Terah, Abram&rsquo;s father, and his relatives dwelt there serving idols (Josh. 24:2). When God called Abram, on the negative side, He told him to go out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father&rsquo;s house, to stay far away from the people, place, activities, and things related to the service of idols. On the positive side, He told him to go to the place that He would show him, implying a promise, the promise of the good land. God intended for Abram to serve Him in the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. God to Make Him a Great Nation</h2>
<p>In this covenant God also promised Abram that He would make him a great nation (Gen. 12:2). At Babel, man had abused the God-given authority to form nations (Gen. 10), but here God promised to make Abram a great nation. He did not have to struggle and endeavor to form a nation. What a strong contrast this was to the background at that time! The great nation promised by God is the kingdom of God, constituted of Abram and his descendants and composed of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and the new earth in eternity. All the nations formed by man on the earth will pass away, but this great nation will last unto eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. God to Bless Him and to Make His Name Great</h2>
<p>God also promised to bless Abram and to make his name great. This also was a strong contrast to the background at that time, where the people, like those at the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:4), were trying to make a name for themselves, to make their names great. In contrast to them, Abram did not have to do anything for himself; God would bless him and make his name great. In human history, other than the name of the Lord Jesus, no name on earth is greater than that of Abraham. He is the father of &ldquo;a great nation.&rdquo; He is the father of the nation of Israel and the father of the church, and he will be the father of the millennial kingdom and of all the redeemed ones in eternity. What a great name this is!</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. All Families of the Earth to Be Blessed in Him</h2>
<p>In this covenant God promised not only that He would make Abram a great nation and make his name great, but also that He would make him a blessing to others, that is, that all families of the earth would be blessed in him (Gen. 12:2-3). The blessing promised by God to Abram is the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation and of His redemption, including all that God wants to give man&mdash;God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come. Galatians 3:14 shows us that this blessing eventually is the promise of the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God, the very God Himself. Therefore, God&rsquo;s promise to Abram was that He would give Himself to him as the blessing. This blessing, which is a great blessing, would come first to Abram and then, through him, would turn to others that all the families of the earth might receive the same blessing.</p><h2 class="head3">5. God to Bless Those Who Would Bless Him<br />
and to Curse Those Who Would Curse Him</h2>
<p>God also promised that He would bless those who bless Abram and would curse those who curse him (Gen. 12:3). History tells us that during the past twenty-five centuries, from the time that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the city of Jerusalem until now, every country, people, race, or individual that has cursed the Jewish people, the descendants of Abram, has received a curse. However, whoever blesses the Jewish people receives a blessing. This is the fulfillment of the covenant that God made with Abram in Genesis 12:3.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Second Time</h2>
<p>Because God appeared to him and made a covenant with him, Abram had the strength to answer God&rsquo;s call. He crossed the river and entered into the land of Canaan, arriving at the place of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh, the right place where God intended for him to be. Hence, God reappeared to him and made a covenant with him the second time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. God to Give the Land of Canaan to His Seed</h2>
<p>God appeared to Abram and promised to give the land of Canaan to his seed (Gen. 12:7). This is the first time that God promised to give the land to him. In Genesis 12:1 God only told Abram to go forth to the land that He would show him. God did not tell him where the land was, nor did He say that He would give the land to him. But, here, God told him clearly that the land was Canaan, and He promised to give the land of Canaan to his seed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Third Time</h2>
<p>After Jehovah God made a covenant with Abram the second time, Abram built an altar and pitched a tent to live a life of the altar and the tent (Gen. 12:7-8). This shows that he lived by faith, offering everything to God and completely trusting in God, and that he had a deeper fellowship with God by calling on the name of Jehovah. This was a high point of his spiritual experience. However, instead of remaining there by the mercy of God, he went downward toward the south, even down to Egypt, because of the famine (Gen. 12:9-10). There he sinned by lying, but he experienced God&rsquo;s keeping grace and learned the lesson that God took care of him in everything and that everything was in God&rsquo;s hand (Gen. 12:11-20). Then he went back to the place where he had built the altar and pitched the tent in the beginning, and there he recovered his calling on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 13:3-4). Lot, having acquired many riches there, strove with Abram and left him. However, because he trusted in God&rsquo;s care, Abram did not strive for himself. Thus, he prevailed in this trial. Therefore, God appeared to him again and made a covenant with him the third time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. God to Give the Land of Canaan<br />
to Him and to His Seed</h2>
<p>After Lot had separated from Abram, Jehovah God appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever&rdquo; (Gen. 13:14-15). Here God promised again that He would give the land of Canaan to Abram and to his seed, thus confirming the promise of the good land in Genesis 12:7.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. God to Make His Seed<br />
as Many as the Dust of the Earth</h2>
<p>In the covenant this time, God also promised Abram that his seed would be as many as the dust of the earth. Genesis 13:16 says, &ldquo;And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.&rdquo; The dust of the earth signifies the earthly children of Abram, the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the constituents of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Fourth Time</h2>
<p>After Jehovah God made a covenant with Abram the third time, Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre. Thus he was brought into another high point of the experience of God to live in fellowship with God. When Lot was captured, Abram fought by trusting in God and prevailed (Gen. 14:14-16), testifying to the fact that God is the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, receiving the supply of bread and wine from Melchisedec (Gen. 14:18-19), and overcoming the temptation of earthly substance (Gen. 14:21-23). After this incident, God appeared to him again to make a covenant with him the fourth time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. God to Cause Him<br />
to Have a Son Born of Himself</h2>
<p>In the covenant God promised this time that Abram would have a son born of himself (Gen. 15:4). God called Abram with the intention of gaining a kingdom to exercise His authority on earth and to express His glory. In order to have a kingdom, a seed is needed. Only when there is a seed can there be the kingdom; without the seed, there is no possibility to produce the kingdom. Hence, in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose, a seed was needed, and the seed had to be of the promise of God and had to be born of Abram. Therefore, God promised that Abram would have a son born of himself to be his seed.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God to Make His Seed<br />
as Many as the Stars in Heaven</h2>
<p>God promised Abram not only that he would bear a son of himself but that his seed would be as many as the stars in heaven (Gen. 15:5). Stars signify the heavenly children of Abram, the believers in the New Testament. Not only have they been separated from the corrupted world, but they also are heavenly, their citizenship is in the heavens (Phil. 3:20), and they constitute the church in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. God to Give the Land of Canaan<br />
to Him and to His Seed</h2>
<p>God promised again to give the land of Canaan to Abram and to his seed (Gen. 15:7, 18-21). In order to fulfill His purpose, God needed not only the seed but also the land. The land is the place where God&rsquo;s people may have rest and where they can defeat God&rsquo;s enemies, establish God&rsquo;s kingdom, and build God&rsquo;s habitation that God may be expressed and represented on this rebellious earth. Therefore, God confirmed His promise once again that He would give the land of Canaan to Abram and to his seed.</p>
<p>When God promised Abram that he would have a seed, Abram immediately believed, and God counted his faith as righteousness and justified him (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). However, when God promised to give him the land, Abram was lacking in faith. Because Abram found it difficult to believe in God regarding the promise of the land, God was forced to confirm His promise by making a covenant with him in an extraordinary way. In the process of making the covenant, God appeared as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch, passing through the pieces of the sacrifices. Moreover, a horror of great darkness fell upon Abram, in the midst of which came the prophecy that his seed would suffer affliction for four hundred years as a sign of the fulfillment of this covenant (Gen. 15:12-17). History proves that Abram&rsquo;s seed did suffer affliction for a period of four hundred years, beginning with Ishmael&rsquo;s persecution of Isaac (Gen. 21:9; Gal. 4:29) and continuing until Israel&rsquo;s exodus from Egypt (Exo. 3:7-8; Acts 7:6). While Abram was in Canaan, it was a strange land to him, and it remained a strange land to his descendants until the day they entered into it as the good land. It was then that God&rsquo;s promise of the land to Abram was fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Fifth Time</h2>
<p>God had made a covenant with Abram the fourth time, yet Abram accepted the proposal of Sarai, his wife, and by the strength of his flesh begot Ishmael through Hagar, causing God to hide Himself from him for thirteen years. When Abram was ninety-nine years old, God appeared to him again to reveal His name as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One (Gen. 17:1), to be the rich source of the supply of grace to keep His covenant for the fulfillment of His purpose, and He also made a covenant with him the fifth time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. God Changing His Name<br />
from Abram to Abraham, Making Him<br />
the Father of Many Nations</h2>
<p>In making a covenant with Abram, God changed Abram&rsquo;s name to Abraham that he might be the father of many nations (Gen. 17:5). &ldquo;Abram&rdquo; means &ldquo;exalted father&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abraham&rdquo; means &ldquo;father of a great multitude,&rdquo; that is, a multiplied father. For the fulfillment of His purpose God needs someone who is a father of a great multitude, a multiplied father, not merely an exalted father or an exalted individual, but a multiplied person. Hence, God changed Abram&rsquo;s name to Abraham to make him the father of many nations that his seed might multiply and become a great nation for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Nations to Be Made of Him<br />
and Kings to Come Out of Him</h2>
<p>In changing Abram&rsquo;s name to Abraham that he might be the father of many nations, God&rsquo;s intention was to gain a kingdom through him. The nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity, all constitute the kingdom of God which God intended to have through Abraham. Therefore, nations were to be made of him. Furthermore, kings were to come out of him (Gen. 17:6). In the Old Testament there were David, Solomon, and others as kings of Israel; in the New Testament there is the Lord Jesus as the King in the church; in the coming age there will be the overcomers as co-kings of Christ; and in eternity there will be all the redeemed ones, as constituents of the New Jerusalem, reigning as kings unto eternity. They all are descendants of Abraham; hence, kings were to come out of him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. God to Confirm His Covenant<br />
with Him and with His Seed<br />
and to Be a God to Him and to His Seed</h2>
<p>Not only did God make a covenant with Abraham, but He also appeared to Isaac and Jacob, descendants of Abraham, to confirm His covenant (Gen. 17:19; 26:2-4, 24; 28:13-14) as the eternal covenant (Gen. 17:7). Although there was a negative effect on this covenant because of the law that came four hundred thirty years later (Gal. 3:17), it was reconfirmed unto eternity through the enactment of the new covenant by the Lord Jesus&rsquo; shedding of His blood on the cross (Gal. 3:17, 22b). In this covenant God promised that He would be the God of Abraham and of his seed. Therefore, God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Gen. 26:24; 28:13; Exo. 3:6, 15), the God of all the families of Israel (Jer. 31:1), the God of all the believers in the New Testament (John 20:17), the God of the saved Israelites at the coming back of Christ (Heb. 8:10), and the God of all the redeemed, who are the constituents of the New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 21:7).</p><h2 class="head3">4. God to Give to Him and to His Seed<br />
the Land of Canaan for an Eternal Possession</h2>
<p>God promised once again to give the whole land of Canaan to Abraham and to his seed as their eternal possession (Gen. 17:8). This land was the good land (Exo. 3:8; Deut. 8:7-10), a type of the all-inclusive Christ. Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), in the New Testament age the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land (see note 14<sup>2</sup> in Gal. 3) for us to inherit God as our inheritance unto eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. God Requiring Him and His Seed<br />
to Be Circumcised</h2>
<p>In this covenant God required Abraham and his seed to be circumcised (Gen. 17:10-11). This was an evidence of God&rsquo;s making a covenant with Abraham in order to confirm His covenant. While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not faithful because he had used his natural strength with Hagar to produce Ishmael, rather than begetting a son through Sarah according to the grace of God&rsquo;s promise (Gen. 16). Therefore, God required him to be circumcised, that his flesh, his old man, and his natural strength might be put off. Thus, the all-sufficient God might come to visit him and to enter into him to be his all, that by God&rsquo;s grace he might give birth to Isaac through Sarah for the fulfillment of the covenant which God made with him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. God Changing His Wife&rsquo;s Name<br />
from Sarai to Sarah, Who Would Bear a Son<br />
for Him and Would Be a Mother of Nations</h2>
<p>God also changed the name of Sarai, Abraham&rsquo;s wife, to Sarah, who would bear a son for Abraham and who would be a mother of nations, of whom kings would come (Gen. 17:15-16). &ldquo;Sarai&rdquo; means &ldquo;my princess&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sarah&rdquo; means &ldquo;princess.&rdquo; To change Sarai to Sarah means to change &ldquo;my princess&rdquo; to &ldquo;princess.&rdquo; By &ldquo;my&rdquo; being removed, she was changed from being narrow to being broad, thus becoming a mother of many nations. Furthermore, God blessed Sarah so that Abraham would have a son of her. At that time Abraham&rsquo;s body had become old, even as good as dead, and Sarah had lost her function. Now that they had become nothing, God promised that Sarah would bear Isaac. This means that the birth of Isaac was not the result of Abraham and Sarah&rsquo;s energy; it was absolutely the result of God&rsquo;s gracious visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sixth Time</h2>
<p>After God made a covenant with Abraham the fifth time, Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Following this, he was ushered into a glorious stage of his experience&mdash;living in fellowship with God. In this stage God did not appear to Abraham as the God of glory or as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, nor did He come to him as El-Shaddai; He came to visit him in the form of a mortal man to be his friend (James 2:23; Isa. 41:8; 2 Chron. 20:7) and to have sweet fellowship with him. In such a sweet fellowship with God, Abraham received revelation from Him regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom. On the one hand, God confirmed the promise regarding the birth of Isaac, that Sarah would give birth to Isaac at the time of life, at the appointed time (Gen. 17:21; 18:10-14); on the other hand, He caused Abraham to learn of His concern about Lot and to intercede for Lot according to the divine revelation. After this, Abraham journeyed again toward the south, repeating his old failure (Gen. 20:2; 12:11-13) and exposing his hidden weakness (Gen. 20:11-13). Yet in a shameful intercession (Gen. 20:17-18) he experienced God&rsquo;s twofold answer. Not only did God heal Abimelech&rsquo;s wife and maidservants so that they bore children, but He also visited Sarah according to His earlier promise and caused her to give birth to Isaac at the appointed time (Gen. 21:1-2). After Isaac grew up, God tested Abraham, telling him to offer to Him Isaac, whom He had given him in grace (Gen. 22:1-2). Abraham obeyed immediately because he believed that God was able to raise him from among the dead, from whence he also received him back in a figure (Heb. 11:19; Rom. 4:17). This was the highest point of his living in fellowship with God and of his obedience to God by faith, thus bringing satisfaction to God. Hence, God came to make a covenant with him the sixth time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. God to Greatly Bless Him</h2>
<p>God promised Abraham that He would bless him greatly (Gen. 22:17). In speaking of the covenant made the first time we said that this blessing eventually is the promise of the Spirit and that the Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God, the very God Himself. Therefore, God&rsquo;s intention was to give Himself to Abraham as the great blessing.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God to Multiply His Descendants<br />
as the Stars of the Heavens and<br />
as the Sand Which Is upon the Seashore,<br />
and They to Possess the Gate of Their Enemies</h2>
<p>God promised Abraham that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and that they would possess the gate of their enemies (Gen. 22:17). Stars signify the heavenly children of Abraham, the believers in the New Testament; sand signifies the earthly children of Abraham, the children of Israel in the Old Testament. These two peoples eventually will be built together, constituting the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity. They will reign as kings to rule over the nations forever.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. God to Cause<br />
All Nations of the Earth<br />
to Be Blessed in His Seed</h2>
<p>God also promised that all nations of the earth would be blessed in Abraham&rsquo;s seed (Gen. 22:18). God did not say that all nations would be blessed in Abraham&rsquo;s seeds, as concerning many, but in his seed, as concerning one, who is Christ (Gal. 3:16). In God&rsquo;s eyes Abraham has only one seed, that is, Christ, in whom all nations will be blessed. In Christ man is justified (Rom. 5:18-19), in Christ man is sanctified (1 Cor. 1:2), and in Christ man receives the promise of the Spirit (Gal. 3:14). Every spiritual blessing given by God (Eph. 1:3) is received by man in Christ, the unique seed of Abraham. Therefore, the promise that all nations of the earth would be blessed in the seed of Abraham has been fulfilled in Christ through His redemption by the cross and through His coming as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Though Keeping the Covenant,<br />
Abraham Leaving the Land of Promise Twice</h2>
<p>Abraham kept the covenant that God made with him. He got out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father&rsquo;s house; his name and his wife&rsquo;s name were changed; and he was circumcised and all the men of his house were circumcised with him. However, he left the land of God&rsquo;s promise twice. Once he went down to Egypt because of a famine; there he sinned by lying in order to save his own life. However, he experienced God&rsquo;s keeping grace and learned the lesson that God took care of him in everything and that everything was in God&rsquo;s hand (Gen. 12:10-20). Another time, acting on his own, he left the place of fellowship with God at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron and went down to Gerar, which was between Kadesh and Shur (Gen. 20:1). There he repeated the old failure, exposing his hidden weakness. Again, preserved by God&rsquo;s sovereign care, he was able to deal with the circumstances, that the testimony of God&rsquo;s grace might be maintained. Moreover, he begot Isaac through Sarah when he experienced God&rsquo;s twofold answer to his shameful intercession.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The House of Jacob, His Descendants,<br />
Leaving the Land of Promise<br />
and Going Down to Egypt</h2>
<p>Because there was a severe famine over all the face of the earth, except in the land of Egypt (Gen. 41:54, 56-57), and because his son Joseph was a ruler over Egypt and he was eager to see him (Gen. 45:28), Jacob, a descendant of Abraham, brought his whole household to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to God. God said to him, &ldquo;I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes&rdquo; (Gen. 46:4). Thereafter Jacob and his sons left the land that God had promised to them and went down to Egypt (Exo. 1:1-5). Then when a new king arose who did not know Joseph, they fell under the tyranny and bondage of Egypt (Exo. 5:9, 14, 17-18). This was a fulfillment of God&rsquo;s prophecy in the covenant which He made with Abraham the fourth time, that his descendants would suffer for four hundred years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the descendants of Noah violated the covenant which God had made with Noah, forming nations to oppose God and eventually falling into idolatry, Jehovah, the God of glory, came to call Abraham (Abram) as the head of a new race and to make a covenant with him, the fourth covenant that God made with man. God made a covenant with Abraham at six different times, the contents of which mainly included the following items: first, God would make him a great nation, and nations would be made of him and kings would come out of him; second, God would bless him and make his name great; third, God would give the land of Canaan to him and to his seed for an eternal possession; fourth, God would cause Sarah, his wife, to bear a son, would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and would make him the father of many nations and Sarah, a mother of nations; and fifth, God would give him the promise of grace that all the nations of the earth might be blessed in him and in his seed. The result was that although he kept the covenant, he left the land of promise twice. Furthermore, the house of Jacob, his descendants, all left the land of promise and went down to Egypt, falling under the tyranny and bondage of Egypt.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After God through Moses delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt&rsquo;s oppression and slavery, He brought them to the foot of Mount Sinai, where He made a covenant with them, the fifth covenant that He made with man (Exo. 20&mdash;23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The One Who Set Up the Passover<br />
to Redeem the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was the God who redeemed the children of Israel. When the children of Israel were under the tyranny and slavery of the Egyptians, God heard His people&rsquo;s cry and came down to deliver them. Because Pharaoh would not allow the children of Israel to go out of Egypt, God through Moses sent ten plagues to punish the Egyptians. After the first nine plagues, the Egyptians, who were still hardened in their hearts, would not allow the children of Israel to go out from them. Therefore, God sent the tenth plague, through which He smote all the firstborn, in order to demonstrate His power and accomplish His saving way. He instructed the children of Israel that each household should prepare a lamb without blemish, kill it in the evening on the fourteenth day of the first month, and take its blood and put it on the upper doorposts and on the side posts, for the angel of Jehovah would go through the land at midnight and enter the houses which were not sprinkled with blood to smite the firstborn. Therefore, at midnight Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, but He passed over the children of Israel, since the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the upper doorposts and side posts of their houses (Exo. 12:1-14). Hence, Jehovah, the God of Israel, rescued them out of His judgment through the Passover.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The One Who Delivered the Children of Israel<br />
out of Egypt by His Mighty Hand</h2>
<p>Jehovah God not only delivered the children of Israel from His judgment through the Passover, but He also rescued them by His mighty hand from the Egyptians&rsquo; oppression that they might be delivered out of the tyranny of Pharaoh. First, God used His mighty hand to smite the firstborn of Egypt and thus subdue Pharaoh and the Egyptians so that Pharaoh drove the children of Israel out of Egypt (Exo. 12:31-33). Afterwards, when Pharaoh regretted and led an army to pursue after them, God used the pillar of cloud to separate the pursuing army and the children of Israel. Then God divided the water of the Red Sea with His mighty hand and led the children of Israel through the Red Sea. Finally, God used His mighty hand again to bury Pharaoh and his army under the water of the Red Sea (Exo. 14:5-9, 15-30). Therefore, it was with His mighty hand that Jehovah God rescued the children of Israel from Egypt, bearing them as on eagles&rsquo; wings and bringing them to Himself (Exo. 19:4).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The One Who Led<br />
the Children of Israel<br />
through the Wilderness with<br />
the Heavenly and Spiritual Provision</h2>
<p>Jehovah God led the children of Israel through the wilderness with the heavenly and spiritual provision. When the children of Israel came to the wilderness, God fed them with the manna sent from heaven (Exo. 16:14-35), supplied them with the living water from the cleft rock (Exo. 17:5-6), and bore them as on eagles&rsquo; wings (Exo. 19:4) that they might journey through the wilderness. The manna sent from heaven is a type of Christ as the heavenly food to God&rsquo;s people (John 6:51) that they might become heavenly people. The living water from the cleft rock is a type of Christ becoming the Spirit (1 Cor. 10:4) to quench the thirst of God&rsquo;s people for their satisfaction. The eagles&rsquo; wings signify the grace of God by which they went out of Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness. Therefore, it was by the supply of grace, by the provision of the heavenly food and the spiritual living water, that Jehovah God brought the children of Israel through the wilderness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The One Who Would Lead and Dwell<br />
among the Children of Israel<br />
according to the Way of His Redemption<br />
and the Grace of His Promise</h2>
<p>After the fall of Adam, God revealed the way of His redemption to man, showing him that he could not be justified by God by his own works and that only by offering the sacrifices with the shedding of blood could he be acceptable to God (Gen. 4:3-4). God revealed this way of redemption again to the children of Israel in the matter of their keeping the Passover. God also promised Abraham that his seed, that is, Christ, would be a blessing to the nations of the earth (Gen. 22:18). This is the grace of God&rsquo;s promise. God told the children of Israel to build an altar for the offering of sacrifices and to build the tabernacle (Exo. 20:24; 25:8) that this grace might be fulfilled in type. Hence, through the tabernacle and the offerings, both of which typify Christ, they were blessed to enjoy God as their eternal portion. Through the tabernacle God could speak to them, lead them, and dwell among them (Exo. 29:42, 45; Lev. 1:1; Num. 1:1). Therefore, it was according to the way of His redemption and the promise of His grace that Jehovah God led and dwelt among the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONES WITH WHOM THE COVENANT<br />
WAS MADE&mdash;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Those Who Had Kept the Passover</h2>
<p>When the children of Israel came to the foot of Mount Sinai, they had already kept the Passover, slain the lamb, put the blood of the lamb on their doorposts, and eaten the meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs. This is an indication that the children of Israel, having been redeemed by God, were no longer under God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Those Who Had Been Delivered Out of Egypt</h2>
<p>The children of Israel had also been delivered out of Egypt by the power of God. They had crossed the Red Sea and had been rescued from the tyranny and slavery of Pharaoh. Moreover, Pharaoh and his pursuing army had been drowned and buried in the Red Sea by the mighty hand of God. Thus, the children of Israel had been delivered out of Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Those Who Had Passed through the Wilderness</h2>
<p>The children of Israel had been brought through the wilderness by God&rsquo;s grace. They had received the supply of God&rsquo;s grace, as signified by the tree that changed the bitter water into sweet (Exo. 15:23-25), by the twelve springs of water at Elim (Exo. 15:27), by the manna that came down from heaven (Exo. 16:14-15, 31-32, 35), by the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6), and by the pillars of cloud and of fire (Exo. 13:21). Thus they had passed through the wilderness and arrived at Mount Sinai.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Those Who Did Not Know Themselves</h2>
<p>The children of Israel had kept the Passover and had been redeemed by God, they had been rescued out of Egypt by God&rsquo;s power, and they had been brought through the wilderness by God&rsquo;s grace. However, because of their blindness, they knew neither the grace of God nor themselves, thinking that they were able to keep God&rsquo;s commands by themselves. Therefore, at Mount Sinai God made a covenant with those who did not know themselves, the fifth covenant that He made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH<br />
THE COVENANT WAS MADE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel Having Enjoyed<br />
God&rsquo;s Redemption but Not Knowing God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>All the way to Mount Sinai the children of Israel truly enjoyed God&rsquo;s redemption, His powerful deliverance, and the leading of His grace. Therefore, God called to Moses from the mountain, saying, &ldquo;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4-6). When they heard these words of grace, they should have asked God to continue to deal with them in grace and to take care of them in everything. However, they neither knew the grace of God nor respected or trusted in the grace of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Children of Israel Not Knowing<br />
Their Corruption, Weakness, and Inability<br />
to Keep God&rsquo;s Commands</h2>
<p>The children of Israel did not know the grace of God. Not only so, they did not know that they were fallen, that they were idolatrous (Ezek. 20:7-8), that they had an evil heart of unbelief (Exo. 14:10-12), and that they often murmured (Exo. 16:2-3). Because they did not know their corruption, weakness, and inability to keep Jehovah&rsquo;s commands, they answered Him, saying, &ldquo;All that the Lord hath spoken we will do&rdquo; (Exo. 19:8). Hence, God immediately changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change in the atmosphere. He told Moses that He would come in a thick cloud. He also charged the people to sanctify themselves, to wash their clothes, and to observe the boundary, not to go up into the mount, nor touch the border of it, for whoever would touch the mount would surely be put to death. On the third day in the morning, there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled (Exo. 19:7-16). This was the result of the children of Israel&rsquo;s not knowing themselves; this was also the background against which God made a covenant with them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<p>The basic content of this covenant is the law. God gave the law to the children of Israel as a covenant that He made with them and through which He also revealed Himself to them. In the enactment of laws there is an important principle: the kind of law a person makes expresses the kind of person that he is; a law is always a revelation of what kind of person has enacted that law. This principle applies even more appropriately to God Himself. Therefore, through the law, the children of Israel were able to know what kind of God He is. Hence, the law testifies for God and is called the testimony of God in the Old Testament (Num. 17:4; Exo. 32:15; 25:16, 22; 38:21; Psa. 19:7; 119:88).</p>
<p>The contents of the law are divided into three big items: commandments, statutes, and ordinances (Deut. 30:16; 1 Kings 2:3; cf. Exo. 15:25-26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Commandments</h2>
<p>The commandments, as God&rsquo;s basic commands, are the general principles of the law. There are ten commandments (Exo. 20:2-17). The first commandment is that Jehovah God is the only God and that man should have no other gods besides Him. This reveals that God is singularly one, without mixture. The second commandment is that man should not make for himself graven images nor worship or serve them. The reason for this is that Jehovah God is a jealous God, visiting the iniquity on the third and fourth generations of those who hate Him, but showing lovingkindness to a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments. This tells us that God is jealous, righteous, and, even more, merciful and loving. The third commandment is that man should not take the name of Jehovah God in vain. This shows that God is holy and that we should sanctify His name (Matt. 6:9). The fourth commandment is that man should remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, for the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah God. The Sabbath is a sign of God&rsquo;s holiness, of His separation, indicating that God is holy, separate. The fifth commandment is that man should honor his father and mother, that his days may be long in the land which Jehovah God has given him. This shows that God as the source of love desires to bestow blessings on man. The sixth commandment says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;; the seventh, &ldquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery&rdquo;; and the eighth, &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal.&rdquo; These three commandments reveal that God is merciful and loving and that He is also righteous, not permitting man to inflict injury on another person&rsquo;s physical body, wife, or possessions. The ninth commandment says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.&rdquo; This reveals that God is truthful and full of light; with Him there is no falsehood nor darkness. The tenth commandment says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&rsquo;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&rsquo;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor&rsquo;s.&rdquo; This indicates that God is pure; man covets because he is not pure.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments are divided into two groups of five. In the first group the sacred title &ldquo;Jehovah thy God&rdquo; is used with respect to each commandment. But with the second group, the name of Jehovah is not mentioned even once. Hence, the use of God&rsquo;s name is a determining factor in reckoning the arrangement of the Ten Commandments. The fifth commandment, concerning the honoring of parents, is ranked with the first four commandments, related to God Himself. This is because when we honor our parents, we honor our source, which ultimately is God Himself. In Luke 3 the human generations are traced all the way back to Adam, and then to God. Therefore, God is the source, the origin, of the human race. In brief, the significance of the first five commandments is that we should love Jehovah God the Lord with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind; the significance of the latter five is that we should love our neighbor as ourselves (Matt. 22:36-40).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Statutes</h2>
<p>The statutes, or laws, regulations, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments. Their stress is on man&rsquo;s worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations related to man&rsquo;s relationship with God. To illustrate, Exodus 20:22-26 sets forth the prohibition against making idols and the regulations regarding the building of an altar for the worship of God; Leviticus 1 through 7 explain in detail the way to present offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ordinances</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinances&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;verdicts,&rdquo; or &ldquo;judgments.&rdquo; Ordinances are statutes with verdicts, or judgments, and by extension, (judgmental) rules, ordinances (Exo. 21:1). These also set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments. The emphasis is on the verdicts that concern the relationships between man and others and between man and God, as recorded in Exodus 21:1&mdash;23:19.</p>
<p>Verses 12-14 and 18-32 of chapter twenty-one set forth the sixth commandment, which says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;; they explain the particular commandment in detail, supplement it, and give the verdict concerning it. Verses 15 and 17 of the same chapter set forth the fifth commandment, which says, &ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother,&rdquo; and give the verdict concerning it. Verses 1-6 of chapter twenty-two give a detailed explanation and the verdict concerning the eighth commandment on not stealing; verses 7-15, concerning the tenth commandment on not coveting; verses 16-17 and 19, concerning the seventh commandment on not committing adultery; 22:18 and 20 and 23:13, concerning the first and second commandments on not having other gods and not serving the images; and 23:1-3 and 6-8, concerning the ninth commandment on not bearing false witness. Verse 12 of chapter twenty-three sets forth the fourth commandment on keeping the Sabbath and gives the verdict concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PURPOSE IN MAKING THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Law Causing the Offense to Abound<br />
That Man May Know Sin</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was to deal with the children of Israel according to grace. However, they did not know themselves and they did not trust in God&rsquo;s grace. Hence, God began to deal with them according to the law, that through the law the offense might abound (Rom. 5:20a), that is, that their offense might be made manifest, so that they might know that they were not able to keep God&rsquo;s commands and thus might know their own corruption, weakness, and inability. Without the law, man does not know what sin is, but when the law is present, man knows not only what sin is but also what sins he has committed (Rom. 7:7), for by law man has the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20) and of his own corruption. Thus the law causes every mouth to be stopped that all the world may become subject to the judgment of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Law Guarding and Shutting Up<br />
God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2>
<p>God made the covenant with the children of Israel for the purpose of guarding and shutting up God&rsquo;s chosen people, as the sheepfold guards the flock (John 10:1). On a ranch, most of the time the sheep remain in the pasture, not in the fold. The fold is merely a temporary place, but the pasture is a permanent place for them to stay. It is only at night or during winter, when the green pasture is not available, that the sheep are guarded and protected in the fold. In the same manner, before Christ came, God&rsquo;s chosen people were temporarily guarded and shut up under the law (Gal. 3:23) that they might be kept until Christ came.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Law Being the Child-conductor<br />
of God&rsquo;s Chosen People unto Christ</h2>
<p>The law also became the child-conductor of the children of Israel unto Christ (Gal. 3:24). In ancient times, a child-conductor was one who cared for a child under age and conducted him to the schoolmaster. In like manner, the law, as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, was to watch over God&rsquo;s chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and conduct them to Christ when He did come, that they might believe into Him and be saved by Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, God gave the law in order to cause the offense of the children of Israel to abound that they might know sin, to guard and shut them up, and to bring them to Christ. To illustrate, suppose an Israelite sinned. According to the law, he must be condemned and even be put to death, since the law exposed his sin and condemned him. However, by offering the trespass offering on the altar through the priests he could be forgiven. This shows that the law first exposes man and then brings man to Christ. When man is exposed and condemned by the law, he knows that he must bring to the altar the offerings, which typify Christ, that his sins may be forgiven. Therefore, the purpose of God in giving man the law is to expose and condemn man that he may be brought to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. By the Offering of Burnt Offerings<br />
and Peace Offerings</h2>
<p>Exodus 24:4-5 says, &ldquo;And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill....And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord.&rdquo; God did not give the law that His people might keep it. Therefore, He did not ask them to swear that they would keep the law; rather, He told Moses to build an altar and to offer sacrifices. The altar and the sacrifices indicate that they could not keep God&rsquo;s law; they needed to be redeemed, and they also needed to be terminated and replaced by the sacrifices.</p>
<p>The burnt offering signifies that Christ lived a life on earth that was absolutely for God, offering Himself without blemish and spot to God to fully satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. The peace offering signifies that Christ shed His blood and died for man to become the peace between man and God, that God may have harmony and fellowship with man and that God and man may enjoy peace together. Originally, the law contained in this covenant was for man to keep God&rsquo;s commandments that God might be satisfied and that man might have harmony with God to enjoy peace with Him. However, because man was unable to keep God&rsquo;s commandments, he needed Christ to be the burnt offering and the peace offering. For this reason, when this covenant was made, Moses built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, which typify Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. By the Sprinkling of the Blood of Sacrifices<br />
on the Book of the Covenant and on the People</h2>
<p>Exodus 24:6 says, &ldquo;And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.&rdquo; This blood came from the sacrifices offered on the altar. Moses also sprinkled the blood on both the book of the covenant itself and on all the people and said, &ldquo;This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you&rdquo; (Heb. 9:19-20; Exo. 24:8). To sprinkle the blood was to use the redeeming blood to cover the book of the covenant and those who received the book, satisfying the requirement of the book toward those who received it, so that those who received the book and violated it would not be condemned. The sprinkling of the blood also caused those who received the book to be redeemed and freed from the requirement and condemnation of the book. This indicates that at the time the covenant was made, because God knew that the children of Israel, who received the covenant, would break the words of the covenant, He prepared Christ&rsquo;s redemption for them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Covenant Being Broken<br />
before Its Consummation</h2>
<p>Before the covenant was consummated, the children of Israel, who were to receive the covenant, made a golden calf and worshipped it (Exo. 32:1-6), violating the first three commandments of the covenant. Thus, the tablets of the covenant were broken before they were delivered (Exo. 32:19). This shows that before the covenant was consummated it was broken; this also indicates man&rsquo;s inability to keep the covenant. Therefore, before He delivered the tablets of the covenant, God first revealed to the people who would receive the covenant how they should draw near to God through the tabernacle and the offerings (Exo. 25&mdash;31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Children of Israel Disobeying<br />
the Covenant throughout Their Generations</h2>
<p>After the consummation of the covenant, the children of Israel, who received the covenant, disobeyed all the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the covenant throughout their generations. Thus, they were cursed and punished by God. Therefore, God spoke through the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt&rdquo; (Jer. 31:31-32). The covenant being impossible because of the weakness of man (Rom. 8:3), God promised to make a new covenant with the children of Israel. Thereafter, the covenant of law which He previously made with them became the old covenant. &ldquo;Now that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing&rdquo; (Heb. 8:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Just Men Who Were Perfected by God<br />
among the Children of Israel<br />
Being Kept by the Covenant</h2>
<p>Among the children of Israel who received the covenant, some became the just men who were made perfect by God in the Old Testament (Heb. 12:23). These just men, such as David, Samuel, and the prophets in the Old Testament, were kept and shut up by the covenant and brought to the way of God&rsquo;s redemption, being accepted and blessed by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When God through Moses delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, and brought them to the foot of Mount Sinai, He made a covenant with them, the fifth covenant that He made with man. They had kept the Passover and had been redeemed by God, they had been rescued out of Egypt by God&rsquo;s power, and they had been brought through the wilderness by God&rsquo;s grace. However, not knowing themselves, they thought they were able to keep God&rsquo;s commands by themselves. Therefore, through Moses, God decreed the law, which was enacted according to what He is, in order to expose their offense that they might know sin, and to guard and shut them up that they might be brought to Christ. The contents of the law are divided into the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances. The commandments, as God&rsquo;s basic commands, are the general principles of the law. There are ten commandments. The statutes set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments; their stress is on man&rsquo;s worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations pertaining to man&rsquo;s relationship with God. The ordinances, which are statutes with verdicts, or judgments, also set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments; the emphasis is on the verdicts that concern the relationships between man and others and between man and God. This covenant was consummated by the offering of burnt offerings and peace offerings and by the sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices on the book of the covenant and on the people. Because God knew that they would break the words of the covenant, He prepared the sacrifices, which typify Christ, that they might be redeemed and have harmony with God to enjoy peace with Him. The result of making the covenant was that before the consummation of the covenant they worshipped the golden calf and thus broke the covenant. Moreover, after the consummation of the covenant, they disobeyed all the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the covenant throughout their generations. However, there were some just men who were perfected by God and who were kept and shut up by the covenant and were thus brought to the way of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Through Moses God brought the children of Israel to the east of Jordan, to the land of Moab (Deut. 1:5), and before they went on to take the good land of Canaan, He made a covenant with them through Moses, the sixth covenant that God made with man (Deut. 29&mdash;30).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The One Who Brought the Children of Israel<br />
from Egypt to Mount Sinai</h2>
<p>The One who made the covenant is Jehovah God, who brought the children of Israel from Egypt to Mount Sinai. Through the Passover He rescued them from His judgment; He brought them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea, delivering them out of the Egyptian tyranny and out of Egypt, the land of bondage; and He led them to experience the tree that changed the bitter water into sweet (Exo. 15:23-25), the twelve springs at Elim (Exo. 15:27), the manna sent from heaven (Exo. 16:14-15, 31-32, 35), and the living water flowing out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6). These items signify Christ as man&rsquo;s life supply in different aspects, by which God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:1-2). There Jehovah God made the covenant of the law with them, revealing Himself to them that they might know what kind of God He was and with what kind of God they fellowshipped. He also instructed them to build the tabernacle as His dwelling place that His glory might be concretely expressed on a large scale.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The One Who Led the Children of Israel<br />
Forty Years through the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Jehovah God also led the children of Israel through the great and terrible wilderness for forty years (Deut. 8:15) to humble them, to test them, and to know what was in their heart (Deut. 8:2). He humbled them and let them be hungry, and fed them with manna which their fathers did not know, that He might make them know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Jehovah (Deut. 8:3). He disciplined them as a man disciplines his son (Deut. 8:5). Moreover, He cared for them so that for forty years in the wilderness their clothes did not wear out upon them, and their sandals did not wear out on their feet, in order that they might know that Jehovah was their God (Deut. 29:5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The One Who Was about to Bring<br />
the Children of Israel through the Jordan<br />
to Take the Good Land of Canaan</h2>
<p>After forty years of wandering, the old generation of the children of Israel fell and died in the wilderness. At that time God brought the new generation of the children of Israel to the east of the Jordan in the land of Moab and was about to bring them through the Jordan to take the good land of Canaan, the land that God swore to their fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants for a possession. Deuteronomy 9:1-3 says, &ldquo;Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven....The Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face.&rdquo; It was just before they crossed the Jordan that Jehovah God made this covenant with them.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ONES WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;<br />
A NEW GENERATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Descendants of the Old Generation,<br />
Who Tempted God and Were Punished by God<br />
and Strewn Along in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Although the old generation saw the glory of God and the signs which He did in Egypt and in the wilderness, they murmured again and again (Num. 11:1, 4-6), tempted God and did not listen to His voice (Num. 14:22), and even despised Him in that they did not believe in His promise of the land of Canaan to them (Num. 13:25-33; 14:1-10). Hence, God swore by His existence that their carcasses would fall in the wilderness and that all the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, except Caleb and Joshua, would not come into the good land of Canaan which He swore to their fathers (Num. 14:28-30). Eventually, the old generation of the children of Israel suffered God&rsquo;s punishment and were strewn along in the wilderness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Those Whom the Old Generation<br />
Considered a Prey and<br />
Too Weak to Enter Canaan</h2>
<p>The new generation of the children of Israel were considered by the old generation to be a prey and to be too weak to enter Canaan (Num. 14:31; Deut. 1:39). When the men sent by Moses to spy out the land of Canaan came back, they gave an evil report to the children of Israel so that the people lifted up their voice and cried, and they wept all night. All the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses, saying, &ldquo;Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey?&rdquo; (Num. 14:2-3). Therefore, Jehovah swore in His wrath that they would not enter the land of Canaan, but their little ones, whom they considered to be a prey and to be too weak to enter Canaan, He would bring in and with them He would make a covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Those Who Wandered in the Wilderness<br />
and Bore the Whoredoms<br />
of the Old Generation Forty Years</h2>
<p>Because the children of Israel had sinned, their children had to wander forty years in the wilderness and bear their whoredoms, such as worshipping idols (Exo. 32:1-6) and having an evil heart of unbelief (Num. 14:1-3), until their carcasses were consumed in the wilderness (Num. 14:33). According to the number of the days in which they spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, the new generation of the children of Israel had to bear their iniquities, even forty years (Num. 14:33-34). Forty years signifies a period of trial and testing (Deut. 8:2). After this period would be over, blessings would come. Therefore, God would grant them again His visitation, blessing them and making the covenant with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Those Whom God Would Bring<br />
into the Good Land of Canaan</h2>
<p>When God forsook the old generation of the children of Israel, He promised to bring their children into the good land of Canaan. After the new generation were tried and tested for forty years in the wilderness, and before God made the covenant with them, He told them plainly through Moses that He would bring them through the Jordan to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than themselves, cities great and fenced up to heaven (Deut. 9:1, 3). Therefore, the ones with whom God made the covenant were those whom God would bring into the good land of Canaan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. They Were to Keep the Covenant That God<br />
Made at Mount Sinai and to Love Jehovah God<br />
with All Their Heart and with All Their Soul</h2>
<p>In the covenant which God made with those who were going to inherit the good land, first they were told to keep all the commandments, statutes, and judgments in the covenant that God made with their fathers at Mount Sinai, and to turn to Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, to love Him, and to cleave to Him (Deut. 30:9-10, 16, 20). In that covenant God gave the law to His people and sought after His lovers. God&rsquo;s intention in giving the law to His chosen people was that they become those who love Him. Ezekiel 16:8 says, &ldquo;Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.&rdquo; According to the context of the chapter, this verse refers to the exodus and the time thereafter. Out of a deep love for the people, God entered into a covenant with them. This covenant was enacted at Mount Sinai through the giving of the law (Exo. 20:1-2).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 31:32 says, &ldquo;...the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them.&rdquo; In this verse God speaks of Himself as a Husband taking them by the hand. This indicates that when God gave the law, He used it as an engagement paper to betroth Israel unto Himself. Therefore, God&rsquo;s law was given in a courting way. By giving His people the law in such a way, God made known to them what kind of God He is and revealed to them His desire in seeking a people to love Him. Hence, God told them that He would show mercy unto thousands of them who would love Him and keep His commandments (Exo. 20:6). This love is not the love between parents and children nor the love between friends; it is the intimate love between husband and wife. This kind of love is necessary for keeping the law of God. God&rsquo;s intention was for the children of Israel to keep His law by loving Him and His word and by becoming one with Him. When God entered into a covenant again with the new generation of the children of Israel, He did not forget this betrothal. He charged them that after they would enter into the good land, they were to keep all the commandments, statutes, and judgments in the covenant which He made with their fathers at Mount Sinai, and to turn to Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, to love Him and to cleave to Him (Deut. 30:9-10, 16, 20).</p><h2 class="head2">B. If They Would Keep the Words of the Covenant<br />
and Do Them, They Would Live and Be Blessed</h2>
<p>If they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, they would live and be blessed, prosper in all things, multiply, and prolong their days (Deut. 29:9; 30:16, 20). Jehovah God is the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments, but repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them (Deut. 7:9-10). Therefore, if they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, God would love them and bless them that they might be blessed in the good land which they would enter to possess. They would be blessed in the city and blessed in the field. The fruit of their body would be blessed, and the fruit of their ground, and the fruit of their beasts, the increase of their cattle, and the young of their flock. They would be blessed when they came in and blessed when they went out. They would be blessed everywhere and in everything (Deut. 28:3-6). Moreover, they would be able to prevail against all their enemies and settle down in the good land of Canaan which God promised to give to their fathers (Deut. 28:7-8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. If They Would Disobey the Word<br />
 of the Covenant, They Would Be Cursed<br />
and Scattered among All the Nations</h2>
<p>If the children of Israel would turn away in their heart from Jehovah their God to disobey the words of His covenant and if they would be enticed to worship and serve other gods, Jehovah would not forgive them; His anger and His jealousy would smoke against them, and all the curse that was written in the book of the law would lie upon them that they might suffer calamities (Deut. 29:18, 20-21). They would be cursed when they went out and cursed when they came in. They would be cursed in the city and cursed in the field. The fruit of their body would be cursed, and the fruit of their ground, the increase of their cattle, and the young of their flock. They would be cursed everywhere and in everything (Deut. 28:16-19). Jehovah would root them out of their land, cast them into another land, and scatter them among the nations (Deut. 29:28; 30:1, 3). How strict God is toward those who forsake Him and His covenant! He is truly fearsome (2 Cor. 5:11), for He is a jealous God (Exo. 20:5) and a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D, If They Would Repent and Obey the Words<br />
of the Covenant, God Would Restore Them</h2>
<p>If the children of Israel would take God&rsquo;s word of blessing to heart in the land of captivity, and if they would return to Jehovah their God and obey His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah God would return and have compassion upon them, restoring them and gathering them from all the peoples where He had scattered them. Even if they were in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there God would gather them and bring them back. He would bring them into the good land which their fathers possessed, and He would do them good and multiply them above their fathers (Deut. 30:1-5). This is because Jehovah is a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth; He keeps lovingkindness for thousands and forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin (Exo. 34:6-7a). He says, &ldquo;For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer&rdquo; (Isa. 54:7-8). For His anger is but for a moment, and His favor is for a lifetime; weeping may last for the night, but joy comes in the morning (Psa. 30:5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. God Would Circumcise Their Heart to Love<br />
Jehovah God with All Their Heart<br />
and with All Their Soul and to Obey His Voice</h2>
<p>After He would gather them and bring them back from the land of captivity, God would circumcise the heart of the returned ones and the heart of their descendants to love Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul and to obey His voice. Moreover, He would make them plenteous in all the work of their hand, in the fruit of their body, and in the fruit of their cattle, and in the fruit of their ground, for good; for God would again rejoice over them for good, as He rejoiced over their fathers (Deut. 30:6-10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. They Turned Away from God and Disobeyed<br />
His Covenant through All Their Generations</h2>
<p>The new generation of the children of Israel, like their fathers, turned away from God through all their generations. They disobeyed all the commandments, statutes, and judgments contained in the two covenants which God made with them at Mount Sinai and in the land of Moab. Although Jehovah God warned them through the prophets to turn from their evil ways, they would not hear, but hardened their neck and would not believe in Jehovah their God. Moreover, they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He made with their fathers, and His warnings with which He warned them; they followed vanity and became vain, and went after the nations that were around them; and they did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, provoking Him to anger (2 Kings 17:13-17).</p><h2 class="head2">B. They Were Cursed, Suffered Calamities,<br />
and Were Carried Away to the Nations</h2>
<p>Therefore, Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted them. They were cursed and suffered calamities, and God delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight (2 Kings 17:20). They have been carried away to the nations and scattered among the peoples, suffering man&rsquo;s mistreatment and persecution, for nearly two thousand six hundred years, just as God spoke through Jeremiah, &ldquo;I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them&rdquo; (Jer. 24:9, ASV).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Until This Day They Still Have Not Turned<br />
Their Heart to God, Who Has Been<br />
Eagerly Expecting Their Return</h2>
<p>Since 1948 the nation of Israel has been restored, and many Israelites have gone back to their homeland to rebuild their homes and establish their kingdom. Furthermore, God has blessed that land again, sending the former rain and the latter rain, making the soil fertile again, and keeping them that they may prevail against the enemies who are around them. Nevertheless, until this day they still have not turned to God, who has been eagerly expecting their return. Although all day long God has been stretching out His hands to them (Rom. 10:21), they still would not receive the incarnated Lord Jesus as their Savior, and they still stumble at the Stone of stumbling (Rom. 9:32-33).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Their Whole House Will Not Repent<br />
and Be Saved until the Coming Again<br />
of the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>Not until the coming again of the Lord Jesus will their whole house repent unto God and be saved (Zech. 12:10-14; Rom. 11:26). At that time the nations will gather at Jerusalem for a battle, and right at the critical moment Christ will come, and His feet will stand upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. Then the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west into two halves, the north and the south, forming a large valley, into which the persecuted Israelites will flee (Zech. 14:1-5). At that time they will look up and see their Savior, the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, the One whom they have pierced. Then they will repent unto God, and the whole house of Israel will be saved. God will open a fountain of grace for them for sin and for uncleanness (Zech. 13:1, 6; John 19:34b; Matt. 26:28), and He will send forth His angels to gather them together from the four winds and bring them back to the good land which God gave their fathers (Matt. 24:31), thus fully restoring the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6). They will be the priests in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, teaching the nations, who will be the citizens, to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Through Moses God brought the children of Israel to the east of Jordan, to the land of Moab, and before they went on to take the good land of Canaan, He made a covenant with them through Moses, the sixth covenant that God made with man. In this covenant, Jehovah God charged the new generation of the children of Israel that after they would enter into the good land, they were to keep all the commandments, statutes, and judgments in the covenant which He made with their fathers at Mount Sinai, and to turn to Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, to love Him and to cleave to Him. If they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, they would live and be blessed and prosper in all things. If they would turn away in their heart from Jehovah God to disobey the words of His covenant, they would be cursed, suffer calamities, and be rooted out of their land and cast into another land and scattered among the nations. If they would take God&rsquo;s word of blessing to heart in the land of captivity, and if they would return to Jehovah their God and obey His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah God would have compassion upon them and would restore them and bring them into the good land which their fathers possessed. God would circumcise the heart of the returned ones and the heart of their descendants to love Jehovah their God with all their heart and with all their soul, and He would again rejoice over them for good, as He rejoiced over their fathers. The result of this covenant was that the new generation of the children of Israel, like their fathers, turned away from God through all their generations and disobeyed God&rsquo;s covenant. They were cursed and suffered calamities; they have been carried away to the nations, suffering man&rsquo;s mistreatment and persecution for nearly two thousand six hundred years. Until this day they still have not turned to God, who has been eagerly expecting their return. Not until the coming again of the Lord Jesus will their whole house repent and be saved. At that time the Lord will send forth His angels to gather them together from the four winds and bring them back to the good land which God gave their fathers.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into the good land of Canaan, and from the time that David became king and there was peace in the entire nation, David desired to build a holy temple for God. At that time God made a covenant with him through Nathan the prophet, the seventh covenant that God made with man (2 Sam. 7:8-16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;<br />
JEHOVAH OF HOSTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Commander of All the Host</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant is Jehovah of hosts (2 Sam. 7:8). This title indicates that Jehovah God is the mighty One, the Lord of all the heavenly host, the Commander of all the host (1 Kings 22:19; Job 1:6). He is the King of glory (Psa. 24:10), the One who is strong and mighty in battle (Psa. 24:8). He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two, and He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth (Psa. 46:9); He will be exalted among the nations, and He will be exalted in the earth (Psa. 46:10). He has the authority to rule over all nations, and His hand holds the authority to remove kings and to set up kings (Dan. 2:21). It is such a Jehovah God, the Commander of all the host, who made this covenant with David.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Divine Title Used<br />
Beginning with the Fall of the Priesthood</h2>
<p>The Bible first uses the title &ldquo;Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; in 1 Samuel 1:3. At that time the two sons of Eli were priests of Jehovah. But they did not know Jehovah, and they despised His offering. Eli knew the iniquity of his sons, who brought a curse upon themselves, yet he did not restrain them (1 Sam. 3:13), for he honored them above God (1 Sam. 2:29). Hence, in Eli the priesthood fell to the uttermost. At this time God revealed His name as Jehovah of hosts, indicating that when His administration was in such a destitute state, He would come out to rule over the entire situation to usher in the reign of His kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT<br />
WAS MADE&mdash;DAVID</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Man after God&rsquo;s Own Heart</h2>
<p>David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart (1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22), who served his own generation by the counsel of God (Acts 13:36). He did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of his life, except in the case in which he fell and sinned because of the wife of Uriah the Hittite (1 Kings 15:5). He submitted himself to the God-ordained authority (1 Sam. 24; 26:6-25), fought for the interest of God, and established the kingdom of God. In the days of his life he did his best in his affliction to prepare the materials for the holy temple of Jehovah (1 Chron. 22:14-16; 29:1-5), even to the extent of neglecting his sleep and meals (2 Sam. 7:1-2; Psa. 132:1-5). Therefore, God testified that he was a man after His own heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The One Who Prevailed against the Enemies<br />
to Become the King</h2>
<p>David was a man of war (1 Chron. 28:3) and a victorious king. He prevailed against Goliath (1 Sam. 17:48-51) and the enemies round about (2 Sam. 8:1-14; ch. 10). Jehovah gave him victory wherever he went and delivered the enemies into his hand to be subdued by him (2 Sam. 8:14; 1 Chron. 22:18). Therefore, David, the one with whom this covenant was made, was not only a man after God&rsquo;s own heart but also one who prevailed against the enemies to become the king.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<p>The covenant which God made with David was included in the covenant which God made with Abraham. The former is a strengthening of the latter, especially in the aspect of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God Would Be with Him,<br />
Would Cut Off All His Enemies from before Him,<br />
and Would Make Him a Great Name</h2>
<p>In this covenant God promised that He would be with David, that He would cut off all his enemies from before him, and that He would make him a great name (2 Sam. 7:9). Because of God&rsquo;s presence, David defeated the Philistines, the Moabites, the Syrians, the Edomites (2 Sam. 8:1-14), and the Ammonites (2 Sam. 10). Jehovah caused the enemies round about to become servants to David and to bring him tribute (2 Sam. 8:2, 6, 14). Thus, God cut off all his enemies and made him a great name (2 Sam. 8:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God Would Cause His Territory to Rest<br />
from All His Enemies</h2>
<p>God also promised David that He would cause his territory to rest from all his enemies (2 Sam. 7:10-11). In the age of the judges the children of Israel forsook God and bowed themselves down to other gods. Therefore, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and He delivered them into the hands of spoilers, who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies (Judg. 2:12-14). Now since David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart, God not only was with him and cut off all his enemies but also caused his territory to rest from all his enemies. Thus, the children of Israel were planted and would not be moved again, nor would they be afflicted anymore.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God Would Make Him a House</h2>
<p>God would make David a house (2 Sam. 7:11b); that is, He would cause him to have a seed for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s will. David had the desire to build a temple for God (2 Sam. 7:1-2); that is, he desired to build a house for God. His thought was pleasing to God. However, he had made great wars and had shed blood abundantly. For this reason, he was not a man of rest and was not suitable for building a house for God (1 Chron. 22:8; 28:3). Nevertheless, God promised him in this covenant that He would make a house for him and would cause him to bring forth a son, whose name would be Solomon and who would be a man of rest to build a house for God (1 Chron. 22:9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. God Would Set Up His Seed after Him<br />
and Would Establish<br />
the Kingdom and Throne of His Seed</h2>
<p>God promised David that He would set up his seed after him and that He would establish the kingdom and throne of his seed (2 Sam. 7:12, 13b). This promise refers not merely to Solomon succeeding to the throne of David his father; even more it refers to Christ reigning as King. Christ is the seed of David (Rom. 1:3), the Son of David (Matt. 1:1), and the greater Solomon (Matt. 12:42). God would cause Him to succeed to the throne of David His father (Luke 1:32-33) and to reign as King to execute justice and righteousness on the earth (Jer. 23:5); moreover, He would establish His kingdom and throne forever and ever (Heb. 1:8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. His Seed<br />
Would Build a House<br />
for God&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>God promised David that his seed would build a house for God&rsquo;s name. This refers not only to Solomon but also to Christ. Solomon typifies Christ as the Son of David succeeding to the throne of David and inheriting his kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12-13; Luke 1:32-33). As a type of Christ, Solomon mainly did two things: he built the house of God in the kingdom (1 Kings 6:2) and he spoke the words of wisdom (1 Kings 10:23-24; Matt. 12:42). As a fulfillment of this type, Christ spoke the words of wisdom in the Gospels, and He is now building the practical house of God, which is the church, in the kingdom of God. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said that He would build His church. The building of the church began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 41-42) and continues up to the present. Today the Lord is still doing the work of building the church. It is not until the appearance of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity that Christ will have completed the work of building the house of God. This is the divine mingling of God with the redeemed, transformed, and glorified ones; it is also a mutual dwelling place for both the redeeming God and His redeemed as the corporate expression of Himself in eternity. Thus, the covenant in which God promised that the seed of David would build a house will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. God Would Be a Father to His Seed,<br />
and His Seed Would Be a Son to God</h2>
<p>Furthermore, God promised David that He would be a Father to his seed and that his seed would be a son to Him. This refers to Christ, as typified by Solomon. Concerning the divinity of Christ, Hebrews 1:5 says, &ldquo;I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son.&rdquo; This word is evidently a quote from 2 Samuel 7:14. Hence, in this covenant, Christ, whom God promised would come to reign as King and build the church, is not only the seed of David but also the Son of God; He has not only humanity but also divinity. This is the first time the Old Testament speaks of Christ as the Son of God, having the deity of God and being equal with God. As the Son of God with the deity of God, He came to be the Christ of God to fulfill the covenant which God made with David.</p><h2 class="head2">G. If His Seed Would Commit Iniquity,<br />
God Would Chasten His Seed,<br />
but His Lovingkindness<br />
Would Not Depart from His Seed</h2>
<p>God promised David that if his seed would commit iniquity, He would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed (2 Sam. 7:14b-15). This word was fulfilled in Solomon and in his descendants. Solomon succeeded to the throne of David and built the holy temple for God. However, in his old age, lusting after his foreign wives, he forsook God and followed his foreign wives to worship idols, thus committing a grievous sin. Hence, God raised up adversaries to him, Hadad the Edomite and Rezon the king of Syria; Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Solomon&rsquo;s servant, also lifted up his hand against him (1 Kings 11:14, 23, 26). Moreover, God was angry with him, and He tore the kingdom from him and gave it to his servant. However, for David&rsquo;s sake, He did not do it in his days; He tore the kingdom out of the hand of his son, but He gave one tribe to his son for the sake of David and of Jerusalem which He had chosen (1 Kings 11:11-13). Although God chastened Solomon with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men, His lovingkindness did not depart from him as it did from Saul, whom He rejected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. His House and His Kingdom<br />
Would Be Made Sure before God,<br />
and His Throne Would Be Established Forever</h2>
<p>God promised David that his house, his kingdom, and his throne would be established forever before God (2 Sam. 7:16). This refers to Christ inheriting the kingdom and throne of David His father. In the house of David, only the kingdom of Christ and His throne will last forever (Dan. 7:14). The word of God conveyed by the archangel Gabriel also confirmed that the covenant of David was fulfilled in Christ. This word says, &ldquo;The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end&rdquo; (Luke 1:32-33). Therefore, God&rsquo;s promise to David that his house and his kingdom would be made sure and that his throne would be established forever was fulfilled in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Solomon His Son<br />
Succeeding Him to the Throne<br />
and Building the Holy Temple for God</h2>
<p>According to the covenant which He made with David, God caused David&rsquo;s son Solomon to succeed David to the throne (1 Kings 1:39) to build the holy temple for God (1 Kings 6:1). Before his death, David gave to Solomon his son the pattern for the building of the holy temple (1 Chron. 28:11-19). After Solomon succeeded to the throne of David, he built the holy temple according to the pattern that his father had seen. This temple became the proper and firm dwelling place of God&rsquo;s desire. At this point, God not only obtained a kingdom to express His authority, but He also gained a house to express His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Solomon Lusting after Foreign Wives<br />
and Following Them to Worship Idols</h2>
<p>Solomon succeeded to the throne of David and built the holy temple for God. However, when he was old, he lusted after foreign wives and thus turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice and had commanded him that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep Jehovah&rsquo;s commandment and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah (1 Kings 11:6, 9-10). Besides taking the daughter of Pharaoh for his wife, he loved many foreign women. The foreign wives turned away his heart after other gods, and he rebuilt the high places for the foreign images (1 Kings 11:6-8). It is hard to imagine that such a one as Solomon, to whom God had given the surpassing wisdom, and who was such a king who had built the holy temple after God&rsquo;s heart, could lust after foreign wives, allow them to lead him away from God to follow them in worshipping idols, and thus provoke God to anger (1 Kings 11:9) to the extent that God would tear the kingdom away from his son (1 Kings 11:12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom of David<br />
Becoming the Tabernacle That Has Fallen<br />
and His Throne Thus Being Suspended</h2>
<p>Because of his son Solomon&rsquo;s wickedness, David&rsquo;s kingdom lost ten tribes (1 Kings 11:29-36) and the nation of Israel was thus divided into two. When both parts were carried away to the nations, the kingdom of David became the tabernacle that has fallen (Amos 9:11), and his throne was thus suspended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In His Coming Back, Christ, the Seed of David,<br />
to Rebuild the Tabernacle of David<br />
That Has Fallen and to Succeed<br />
to the Throne of David to Reign Forever</h2>
<p>When Christ, the seed of David, comes again, He will rebuild the tabernacle of David&mdash;the kingdom of David&mdash;that has fallen; that is, He will restore the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6). He will inherit the throne of David according to the promise of God to David to reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall not be an end (Luke 1:32-33).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into the good land of Canaan, and from the time that David became the king and there was peace in the entire nation, David desired to build the holy temple for God. At that time God made a covenant with him through Nathan the prophet, the seventh covenant that God made with man. The One who made this covenant is Jehovah of hosts, the Commander of all the host. This divine title was used beginning with the fall of the priesthood. The one with whom the covenant was made was David, a man after God&rsquo;s heart and the one who prevailed against the enemies to become the king. This covenant was a strengthening of the covenant which God made with Abraham, especially in the aspect of the kingdom. In this covenant God promised that He would be with David, that He would cut off all his enemies from before him, that He would make him a great name, and that He would cause his territory to rest from all his enemies. Furthermore, God promised that He would make him a house, that He would set up his seed after him, and that He would establish the kingdom and throne of his seed. His seed would build a house for God&rsquo;s name, and God would be a Father to his seed, Christ, and his seed would be a son to God. If his seed (referring to Solomon and his descendants) would commit iniquity, God would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed. His house and his kingdom would be made sure before God, and his throne would be established forever. The result was that his son Solomon succeeded him to the throne and built the holy temple for God. However, when he was old, Solomon lusted after his foreign wives and followed them to worship idols, so that God was angry with him and tore the kingdom out of the hand of his son, thus dividing the kingdom of Israel into two.

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The preceding seven covenants were covenants that God made with man in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, through the death of the Lord Jesus, which accomplished redemption for all men, God made a covenant with all sinners, the eighth, and the last, covenant that God made with man (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20; Heb. 8:8-13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO<br />
MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;<br />
THE LORD JESUS AND GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>The One who made the new covenant is the Lord Jesus (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20). Jesus is a wonderful name which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. This name includes three factors: Jehovah, the Savior, and salvation, indicating that this wonderful Person is Jehovah coming to be the Savior to man and to become salvation to man. He is the very God coming into man to be incarnated. Therefore, He is a God-man; He is both the complete God and the perfect Man. He died and shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption for the sins of all men, thus enacting the new covenant. Hence, the One who made the new covenant is the Lord Jesus, who shed His blood to accomplish redemption for the sins of all men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God</h2>
<p>The One who made the new covenant is also God (Heb. 8:8; Jer. 31:31), who had promised Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him (Gen. 22:18). He did not say, &ldquo;And to the seeds,&rdquo; as concerning many, but as concerning one, &ldquo;And to your seed,&rdquo; who is Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ died on the cross, shedding His precious blood, to accomplish redemption for all men. In this way, according to His promise to Abraham, God can deal with man according to grace in Christ and bestow the blessing upon all people, thus making a covenant with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONES WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;<br />
ALL SINNERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Descendants of Fallen Adam,<br />
Sinners Who Must Die</h2>
<p>The ones with whom the covenant was made are all the sinners (Rom. 3:23-24), who are the descendants of fallen Adam, sinners who must die. When Adam fell, sin entered into mankind through him (Rom. 5:12) to become the constituent of man (Rom. 5:19), and it is passed on from generation to generation in man. Therefore, the descendants of fallen Adam are born sinners with the sinful nature inherited by birth. Actually, sin is the evil nature of Satan, the evil one, dwelling, acting, and reigning in fallen man. Furthermore, since the fruit of sin is death (James 1:15; Rom. 5:12), fallen men have become sinners who must die (Heb. 9:27a); no one can escape death. Nevertheless, God made a covenant with such ones who are descendants of fallen Adam, sinners by birth, who inherited sin in their nature, and sinners who must die.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Those Who Sin and Do Evil according to Satan,<br />
Transgressors Who Deserve Death</h2>
<p>Fallen sinners are not only born sinners and inherit sin in their nature, but they also sin and do evil according to Satan, committing sins themselves, and become transgressors who deserve death. Because fallen men have a life in them that is mingled with the life of Satan, the Devil, and a nature that is mixed with Satan&rsquo;s nature, they have become the children of the Devil (1 John 3:8, 10; John 8:44), walking according to the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2) and sinning and doing evil according to him. It is with such ones who sin and do evil according to Satan, transgressors who deserve death, that God made a covenant.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Those Who Should Perish<br />
under God&rsquo;s Condemnation</h2>
<p>Since fallen sinners have the sin which they inherited by birth and the sins which they committed themselves, they have fallen under God&rsquo;s judgment and condemnation and have become persons who should die and perish. Originally man was created in the image of God to express Him and to represent Him. However, man sinned and fell so that he was unable to express God; on the contrary, he expresses sin and Satan. Hence, man comes short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23) and offends God&rsquo;s righteous law (Rom. 3:20). Therefore, man is under God&rsquo;s condemnation and wrath (Rom. 5:18; John 3:36), deserving death and perdition.</p>
<p>It is with such a man, who is a descendant of fallen Adam, who sins and does evil after Satan, and who is under God&rsquo;s condemnation to die and perish, that God made the new covenant, the last covenant that He made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE NATURE OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. A New Covenant</h2>
<p>This covenant is the new covenant (Luke 22:20; Heb. 8:8-13). The word new in Greek is <em>kainos,</em> denoting new in nature, in quality, and in form. Before the enactment of the new covenant, God made an old covenant, the covenant of the law. Because the old covenant was faulty, weak, and unprofitable, it was annulled (Heb. 7:18; 8:7). Hence, through the Lord Jesus, God made another covenant, the new covenant, with all sinners. This covenant is eternal (Heb. 13:20), and it is eternally effective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Better Covenant</h2>
<p>This covenant is also a better covenant (Heb. 7:22; 8:6). This better covenant was not only enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life (Heb. 8:10-12), but also was consummated with Christ&rsquo;s better sacrifices (Heb. 9:23), which have accomplished for us an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12), and with the better blood of Christ, which purifies our conscience (Heb. 9:14). Not only so, the High Priest of this better covenant, the eternal Son of the living God, ministers also with a more excellent ministry (Heb. 8:6) and in the greater and more perfect tabernacle (Heb. 9:11). Moreover, unlike the old covenant, which was lifeless, the new covenant is constituted with the indestructible life. Hence, everything in the new covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant. Therefore, the new covenant is a better covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<p>The new covenant has been enacted upon better promises. These promises are given in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and are quoted in Hebrews 8:8-12 and in 10:16-17. The contents of the new covenant include the following four items:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God Will Forgive the Sins of All Those<br />
Who Believe in Christ and Will Not Remember<br />
Their Iniquities Anymore</h2>
<p>The first item of the new covenant is that God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in Christ and will not remember their iniquities anymore. Hebrews 8:12 says, &ldquo;I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore.&rdquo; To be propitious is to make propitiation for our sins. Christ made propitiation for our sins (Heb. 2:17) to appease God&rsquo;s righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Based upon this propitiation, God forgives the sins of all those who believe in Christ, and He does not remember their iniquities anymore. This also indicates that God&rsquo;s forgiving is His forgetting of the sins of the forgiven ones. Once He forgives men of their sins, He forgets their sins and does not remember them anymore. This is the first item of the contents of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God Will Impart His Laws<br />
into the Minds of Those Who Believe in Christ,<br />
and on Their Hearts He Will Inscribe Them</h2>
<p>The second item of the contents of the new covenant is that God will impart His laws into the minds of those who believe in Christ, and on their hearts He will inscribe them. Hebrews 8:10 says, &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them.&rdquo; In Jeremiah 31:33 the word law is singular, but in Hebrews 8:10 it is plural. This proves that one law will spread into a number of laws within man. This is the law of life in Romans 8. Every life has a law. The higher the life, the higher is its law. The divine life is the highest; therefore, it has the highest law. When we believe in Christ, God immediately imparts His eternal life into us, and by so doing He puts this highest law into our spirit, from whence it spreads into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will, and becomes several laws. This is the meaning of God&rsquo;s imparting His laws into the minds of those who believe in Christ and inscribing them on their hearts, which is the second item of the contents of the new covenant.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God Will Be God to Them<br />
and They Will Be a People to Him</h2>
<p>The third item of the contents of the new covenant is that God will be God to them and they will be a people to Him (Heb. 8:10b). This word immediately follows the preceding text, indicating that it is according to the law of life that God is God to us and that we are a people to Him. This means that because the divine life enters into us to quicken our spirit, we can use our spirit to worship God, enjoy God, and fellowship with God (John 4:24). In this way, God can be our God, and we can be His people. Under the old covenant, God was God to the people according to the law of letters, and they were His people also according to the law of letters. But today under the new covenant, God is God to us not according to the law of letters but according to the inward law of life, and we are His people not according to any regulations written on tablets of stone but according to the laws inscribed in our hearts. Therefore, it is according to the law of life that God is God to us and we are a people to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. They All Will Know God and Will Not Need<br />
Anyone to Teach Them</h2>
<p>The fourth item of the contents of the new covenant is that they all will know God and will not need anyone to teach them. In Hebrews 8:11 God says, &ldquo;And they shall by no means teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know Me from the little one to the great among them.&rdquo; In this verse the word know occurs twice. In the first instance, the Greek word is <em>ginosko,</em> referring to the outward, objective knowledge; in the second it is <em>oida,</em> referring to the inward, subjective consciousness. Since God has put the law of life into us, spontaneously we have the function by which we know God. Moreover, this knowledge does not come from outward teaching of knowledge; it comes from the inward consciousness of life. Therefore, anyone who partakes of the life of God and who has the law of life in him can know God subjectively from within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Contents of the Entire New Testament</h2>
<p>The contents of the new covenant are also the contents of the entire New Testament. The entire New Testament is a covenant that God made with all sinners. In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant, but after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension it has become a testament, in which He bequeathed to those who believe in Him all the contents recorded in the covenant. Man acquires an inheritance by a testament. The written words of the covenant in the Bible were left to us by the Lord Christ as a testament by which we may inherit the blessings of His salvation. When a person intends to bequeath his possessions, he lists his possessions in a will and bequeaths them to the inheritor. Likewise, the Lord has given His salvation to us by including it in His testament&mdash;the Bible. A man receives a bequest according to the clear stipulation expressed in a will. Likewise, we inherit the Lord&rsquo;s salvation according to the plain statements contained in the Bible, His testament.</p>
<p>The bequests bequeathed to us by the Lord in this testament are inexhaustible; they include such items as the Triune God Himself, redemption, forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, sonship, life, power, and peace. The contents of the entire New Testament are included in the testament which the Lord bequeathed to us. They are inexhaustible and are for us to enjoy unto eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE MEDIATOR AND SURETY OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Mediator</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ is the Mediator, the Go-between, of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24), being responsible both to God and to man. Having died for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, He enabled those who have been called to receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. Through the death of Christ, which accomplished redemption, all the promises of God have become accomplished facts in the new covenant, and all these facts have become bequests in the new testament. As the Mediator, Christ today in His heavenly ministry is the Executor of the new covenant, executing the new testament and carrying out in us every item of the bequests of the new covenant, such as the effectiveness of His all-inclusive death, the power of His resurrection, and His divine life with the law of life, that we may have them as our supply and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Surety</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Surety, the Guarantor, of the new covenant (Heb. 7:22), guaranteeing that the new covenant will become effective and that all the blessings of the new covenant will become practical experiences to the believers. That Christ has become the Surety of the new covenant is based upon the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest, who is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them (Heb. 7:21-22, 25). The root of the Greek word translated surety means a limb, a member of the body. The meaning here is that a member of the body pledges itself to the body. For example, the hand may pledge itself to the arm to do everything for the arm. As the Surety of the new covenant, Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all the New Testament believers. He has bound Himself to do everything that is necessary to guarantee the effectiveness of the new covenant, that is, that the new covenant will be fulfilled. Moreover, since Christ is unlimited, His pledge is also unlimited. Therefore, He is the guarantee that the new covenant can never fail and that all the blessings in the new covenant will be fulfilled in the believers to become their practical experience.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. With Better Sacrifices</h2>
<p>The old covenant was consummated through the sacrifice of bulls and goats as burnt offerings and peace offerings (Exo. 24:4-5); the new covenant was consummated through the offering of Jesus Christ Himself as the sacrifice (Heb. 9:14, 23; 10:12). As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than all the sacrifices of the old covenant. Bulls and goats as sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins (Heb. 10:11), but He as the sacrifices is the reality of the shadows, and He has put away sin once for all, thus finding an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:26, 12), fully satisfying God&rsquo;s desire, and enabling the believers in Him to have peace and fellowship with God that both God and man may be satisfied (Rom. 5:1; Col. 1:20-22; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). The new covenant was consummated in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. With the Blood of Jesus, the Son of God</h2>
<p>Since the new covenant was consummated through Jesus Christ as the better sacrifices, it was, of course, enacted with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God (1 John 1:7). It is not like the old covenant, which was consummated with the blood of bulls and goats which cannot take away sins (Heb. 10:4). The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28). It has accomplished eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19) and has purchased the church of God (Acts 20:28). It washes us from our sins (Rev. 1:5; 1 John 1:7), purifies our conscience (Heb. 9:14), and sanctifies us (Heb. 13:12). By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) and overcome Satan, the accuser (Rev. 12:10-11). Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls (Heb. 9:12-14). The new covenant was consummated with this precious blood (Luke 22:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Being Forgiven of Their Sins</h2>
<p>Thousands and thousands of sinners have received forgiveness of sins by believing in Christ. They are no longer sinners or offenders. They have been delivered from the eternal penalty of sin, and they have been freed from the bondage and power of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Receiving the Law of Life</h2>
<p>The believers not only have been forgiven of their sins by believing in Christ, but they have also received the eternal life with its law of life. By this law of life God can be God to them and they can be a people to Him. Furthermore, the natural function of the law of life enables them to know God subjectively from within and to enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Believers Being Joined to the Triune God<br />
in the Triune God</h2>
<p>The believers have an organic union with the Triune God in Christ. By being joined to Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, the believers enjoy all the riches of His divinity and humanity and participate in all that He has accomplished and attained through His all-inclusive death, His powerful resurrection, and His transcendent ascension. Thus, they become the church as the Body of Christ that God may be expressed in Christ. They will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the complete expression of God to fully express God to the uttermost in the new heaven and new earth in the new universe unto eternity. This is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s making covenants with man throughout the generations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, through the death of the Lord Jesus, which accomplished redemption for all men, God made a covenant with all sinners, the eighth covenant that He made with man. This covenant is the new covenant; it is also a better covenant. Hence, everything in this covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant. The contents of the new covenant include the following items: God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in Christ and will not remember their iniquities anymore; God will impart His laws into their minds, and on their hearts He will inscribe them; God will be God to them, and they will be a people to Him; and they all will know God and will not need anyone to teach them. The contents of the new covenant are also the contents of the entire New Testament; they include such items as the Triune God Himself, redemption, forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, and sonship. These bequests which the Lord bequeathed to the believers are inexhaustible and are for them to enjoy unto eternity. The Mediator of the new covenant is Jesus Christ, who executes the new testament, carrying out every item of the bequests of the new covenant in the believers. He is also the Surety of the new covenant, guaranteeing that the new covenant will become effective and that all the blessings of the new covenant will become practical experiences to the believers. The new covenant was consummated with Christ Himself as the better sacrifices and with His better and precious blood, causing the believers to have forgiveness of sins, the law of life, and a union with the Triune God in the Triune God. This is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s making covenants with man throughout the generations.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After God created all things and mankind according to His eternal plan, His economy, God began His work on the man of His creation in order to accomplish the purpose of His eternal economy. This work can be divided into four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs (the pre-law dispensation), the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom (the dispensation of righteousness).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TWO CATEGORIES OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>God has two categories of work in the universe: the work of creation, which is the work of the old creation, and the work of building, which is the work of the new creation. The sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth of His original creation (Gen. 1:1); the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth, which are the original God-created heaven and earth that have become old and that will be renewed through the burning of God&rsquo;s judging fire (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Work of Creation</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of creation was to prepare all the materials for His work of building, that is, for the work of the new creation. He created all things wholly according to His purpose and plan (Rev. 4:11). The creation of all things was not accidental nor by chance, nor was it done in a casual way; it was something that came out of God&rsquo;s will, something planned by God. In God&rsquo;s plan, He decided to accomplish His work of building by means of all things; therefore, He created all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Work of Building</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s building work, that is, His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation, is to work Himself into the created man to be his life and content that He may have a corporate expression. After man&rsquo;s fall, God uses four different dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom&mdash;in the old creation, which has been corrupted by Satan and which has been judged by Him, to do the work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. He is carrying out this work by the Spirit and the life of the Triune God, who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, by His heavenly ministry after His ascension, and by the things that He will accomplish at His coming back, that He may gain a group of people to be built up into the New Jerusalem as His corporate expression in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE DISPENSATION OF THE PATRIARCHS</h2>
<p>The dispensation of the patriarchs was from Adam to Moses (Rom. 5:14). This was the dispensation before the law; hence, it is also called the pre-law dispensation. In this dispensation, God&rsquo;s work on man can be divided into the following:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. That the Created Man<br />
Might Receive God as Life</h2>
<p>God created man in His image and likeness (Gen. 1:26) that man might have His life to become His expression and to represent Him in His dominion. However, God did not accomplish everything at the time He created man. He left a part, even the most central part, of His creating work incomplete; that is, He did not put His life into man. Therefore, after He finished creating man, He put man in front of the tree of life in the midst of the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:8, 9). His intention was that man should exercise his free will to choose to receive the tree of life, thereby obtaining God&rsquo;s life. The tree of life symbolized God as the source of life. Therefore, for man to receive the life of the tree of life was for him to receive God Himself as life. God also warned man that in addition to the tree of life there was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which symbolized Satan as the source of sin and death. If man would touch it, the result would be death (Gen. 2:17).</p><h2 class="head2">B. That the Fallen Man Might Receive<br />
God&rsquo;s Redemption in Christ</h2>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s intention was that man should receive Him as life, Adam did not receive the tree of life; instead, he disobeyed God&rsquo;s prohibition and took in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:6), receiving into himself the satanic elements of sin and death. Thus, he was constituted a sinner, falling into sin and death (Rom. 5:12). This was the first step of man&rsquo;s fall. In order that the fallen man might receive His redemption in Christ, God came to the place of the fallen man to seek him and to call him. Moreover, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of the woman and as the redemptive sacrifice, shedding His blood to make redemption for sins and imparting His life to rescue the fallen man, that the fallen man might have the life of God and become God&rsquo;s expression for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Adam believed God&rsquo;s promise, and God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them to cover their nakedness (Gen. 3:21). The skin of the sacrifice typifies Christ, who died and shed His blood to make redemption for sinners, as the righteousness of those who believe, that fallen sinners might be justified and accepted by God and have fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. That the Man<br />
Who Received God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption<br />
Might Be Accepted by Him through the Sacrifices</h2>
<p>Adam and Eve received God&rsquo;s promise of redemption and experienced the anticipated redemption. Thereafter they must have preached God&rsquo;s way of redemption to their sons. As a result, Abel believed what his parents preached (Heb. 11:4) and received God&rsquo;s way of redemption (Gen. 4:4). Thus, he became a feeder of sheep (Gen. 4:2), working and living for God and living by God. He knew that he had been born of fallen parents and that he was sinful, evil, and defiled in the eyes of God. Therefore, he offered bleeding sacrifices to God as offerings, not according to his own way, but according to God&rsquo;s way of redemption, and thereby was accepted by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Second Step of Man&rsquo;s Fall&mdash;<br />
Rejecting God&rsquo;s Way of Redemption</h2>
<p>Abel believed the gospel preached by his parents, but his brother Cain rejected God&rsquo;s way of redemption, deviating from God&rsquo;s way of salvation, which resulted in the second step of man&rsquo;s fall. Although he knew that God used the skin of the sacrifice as man&rsquo;s clothing, he presumptuously rejected God&rsquo;s way of redemption. Although he knew that man needed redemption with the shedding of blood, he refused to adopt God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Rather, according to his own idea and method, he offered produce to God without the shedding of blood and was thus rejected by God (Gen. 4:3, 5a). Therefore, he was very angry and his countenance fell (Gen. 4:5), and he even killed his brother Abel (Gen. 4:8). As a result, he was cast out of the presence of Jehovah. Having lost the light of God&rsquo;s countenance, he and his descendants walked their own way and invented a godless culture that included building a city for self-existence, inventing cattle-raising for making a living, inventing music for self-amusement, and inventing weapons for self-defense (Gen. 4:17-22). Eventually, this culture caused his descendants to become so wholly corrupted that they were judged by God through the flood (Gen. 6:11-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. That the Man Who Received God&rsquo;s Redemption<br />
Might Call on the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>After the fall, man went far away from God and lost God as his supply of everything. Therefore, not only did man sense the emptiness of human life, but man also became frail and mortal. Enosh was the third generation of mankind. His name means frail, mortal man, indicating that man realized his own weakness, fragility, and mortality. Therefore, God desired that those whom He redeemed would call upon the name of Jehovah, receiving their supply from Him and enjoying His riches. Enosh thus called on the name of Jehovah, the One who eternally is (Gen. 4:26). Such calling continues throughout the entire Bible (Gen. 12:8; 26:25; Deut. 4:7; 1 Sam. 12:10; 2 Sam. 22:4) and is also enjoyed by the New Testament believers (Acts 9:14; 22:16; 1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. That the Man Who Was Redeemed<br />
and Who Enjoyed God<br />
Might Walk and Work with Him</h2>
<p>The reason that God wanted man to receive His redemption and call upon the name of Jehovah was that man might walk and work with Him, so as to accomplish His purpose in redeeming man, that is, to gain a new race to express Him. Therefore, God gained Enoch and showed him the way to escape the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall&mdash;death. Hence, Enoch rose up and walked with God for three hundred years and was then taken away by God (Gen. 5:24), not seeing death. He not only realized that man&rsquo;s emptiness and fragility needed the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s riches, but he also walked with God; that is, he was not presumptuous, and he did not do things according to his own concept and desire, but he took God as his center and everything, living and doing things according to God and with God. Therefore, God caused him to be raptured and to escape death, that is, to escape the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>God went on further to gain Noah. Not only did Noah walk with God in a corrupted age, but he also worked with God and built the ark (Gen. 6:13-14). Thus, he and his whole family were saved through the ark and were delivered from God&rsquo;s judging flood. Moreover, having passed through the flood in the ark, they were brought safely through by water and delivered out of the corrupted world into a new world in resurrection to begin in a new age with a new life.</p><h2 class="head2">G. That the Man Who Fell from God&rsquo;s Government<br />
Might Be Governed by His Own Conscience</h2>
<p>According to Genesis 2, after God created man, He put man in front of Himself to be under His direct government (Gen. 2:8, 15), to live before Him and to be responsible to Him. That was the divine government. At that time there was no separation, hindrance, or frustration between God and man. Man could fellowship with God directly in his spirit; moreover, his soul was under the direction of his spirit, and his body was under the control of his soul. Man lived directly under this divine government, living and walking according to the guidance of God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>However, man disobeyed God&rsquo;s prohibition and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, man was constituted a sinner (Rom. 5:19), having a record of sin against him outwardly (Rom. 5:18) and the nature of sin inwardly (Rom. 5:12). At this time, the holy, righteous God had no alternative but to leave man, and man could no longer live before God to be under His direct government. Therefore, from the time of Adam&rsquo;s expulsion from the Garden of Eden to the time of Noah&rsquo;s departure from the ark, God established the conscience within man to represent Himself in ruling over man. Thus, man was ruled by his own conscience and was responsible to his own conscience. That was self-government.</p>
<p>According to the truth of the entire Bible and also according to our experience, when God created man, He created a conscience in man. However, it was not until the time of the fall, when man partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that the function of the conscience was made manifest. Before the fall, man was in an innocent state, like a newborn babe. Therefore, at that time he was not ashamed of his nakedness. This proves that within man there was no concept of good and evil, right and wrong; this also indicates that there was neither the feeling nor the function of the conscience. After the fall, man immediately felt ashamed of his nakedness. This sense of shame was the beginning of the function of the conscience; that is, the function of the conscience was activated. Since then, man&rsquo;s conscience has borne the responsibility of rejecting evil and accepting good, enabling man to discern right and wrong, to know what God justifies and what He condemns. Therefore, God put man under the government of his conscience to maintain human existence, that man might receive the redemption of God in Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Third Step of Man&rsquo;s Fall&mdash;<br />
Disregarding the Government of the Conscience</h2>
<p>God had prepared redemption for man that He might be man&rsquo;s supply, thus enabling man to walk and work with Him; moreover, He had established the conscience within man to represent His rule over man. Nevertheless, man would not be governed by his conscience to receive God&rsquo;s salvation. Thus he fell repeatedly, and was eventually judged by God through the flood. Man did not remain very long under self-government. The first person to violate the rule of the conscience was Cain. He murdered his brother Abel, lied to God, and was arrogant toward God. Later, because of man&rsquo;s deeper fall, even the feeling of the conscience was cast aside. Man&rsquo;s conscience became numb, as if it were seared with a hot iron, so that even when he indulged in licentiousness and lusts he hardly had any feeling at all. Therefore, before the flood the earth was filled with violence, every imagination of the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart was only evil continually, and all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth (Gen. 6:5, 11-12). The whole human race had become flesh (Gen. 6:3), and man was wicked and corrupt to the uttermost, so that even the most tolerant God could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, the Spirit of God had to withdraw (Gen. 6:3), and man was fully cut off from God and rejected by God. Eventually God used the flood to bring in the judgment of destruction, rescuing only the eight members of the house of Noah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. That the Man Who Fell from the Government<br />
of the Conscience Might Be Governed by Man</h2>
<p>Fallen man disobeyed his own conscience and was not ruled by his conscience. Therefore, after the flood, God gave man authority over the lawless ones to maintain the existence and order of the human race in order to produce the new race, which was to be chosen and called by God, for the fulfillment of His eternal plan.</p>
<p>Before the flood, there was no human government. It was only after the flood that God established a deputy authority on earth. God commanded Noah, saying, &ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed&rdquo; (Gen. 9:6). This indicates that God put man under the authority of others. Because man was neither subject to God&rsquo;s government nor obedient to self-government, God had to give man authority to rule over others. As a result, soon there began to be nations, and there came into existence among the human race the control of government, the restraints of society, and the regulations of the family. For example, in a nation there are the president and other officials; in a factory, the supervisors; in a school, teachers and a principal; and in a family, parents and elder brothers. All these are deputy authorities set up by God to rule over man. Therefore, Romans 13:1 says, &ldquo;Let every person be subject to the authorities over them.&rdquo; This is human government. God wants the man who fell from the government of the conscience to be ruled by man and be responsible to man. God uses all the deputy authorities to maintain the human race so that the man whom He has chosen and whom He will call may come into being, that His purpose may be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Fourth Step of Man&rsquo;s Fall&mdash;Worshipping<br />
Idols and Conspiring to Rebel against God</h2>
<p>The man who fell repeatedly failed again under human government. He openly and outwardly rejected God, worshipping as idols people and things outside of God. As a result, God rejected the created Adamic race.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s fall from self-government to human government was not the final step of the fall. Man fell further, from human government to Satan&rsquo;s instigation. Human government was of God&rsquo;s authorization. But Satan utilized the authority that God gave man to form nations and to instigate a rebellion of the nations against God. The whole human race rebelled collectively against God&rsquo;s right and authority. They made bricks of earth by human labor (Gen. 11:3), and they built a city to carry on a man-made, godless life. Moreover, they intended to build a tower that would reach into heaven in order to make themselves a name and to reject, to deny, God&rsquo;s name. Eventually, they fell into idolatry. Every brick that they used to build the city and the tower of Babel bore the name of an idol. The entire human race followed Satan, rebelled against God, and worshipped idols. At this point, because man had fallen to the uttermost, God was eventually forced to give up the created race of Adam and to scatter it over the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. Calling a New Race and Giving It<br />
the Promise of Grace</h2>
<p>God rejected the Adamic race, which was fallen to the uttermost, and called Abraham out of it to be the father of a new race, giving him the promise of grace, that this new race would hope in the Christ who would come to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth (Gen. 22:18a; Gal. 3:14, 16).</p>
<p>Abraham originally lived in Ur of Chaldea, a place in which the people served demons (Josh. 24:2) and rebelled against God (Gen. 11:3-4). At that time the human race had fallen to the uttermost. Outwardly it seemed that the things Satan had done through fallen man had driven God out from the earth. But God is sovereign over all. He can never be defeated, and His purpose is unalterable. He will accomplish whatever He determines to accomplish. Satan&rsquo;s interruption only affords Him the opportunity to make known His multifarious wisdom. Therefore, it was at the time that man had fallen to the uttermost that God came to the fallen place and called Abraham out from among the fallen people according to His foreknowledge, selection, and predestination before the foundation of the world, that He might have a new beginning among the fallen men. God&rsquo;s calling of Abraham indicated that His work on man had turned from the created Adamic race to the called Abrahamic race (Gen. 12:2-3; Gal. 3:7-9, 14; Rom. 4:16-17). Abraham was the father of the new race.</p>
<p>Moreover, God gave Abraham the promise of grace: that He would cause him to bear a son (Gen. 15:4), that He would give the land of Canaan to him and to his seed (Gen. 15:7, 18-21), and that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 22:18a). God did not say, &ldquo;And to the seeds,&rdquo; as concerning many, but as concerning one, &ldquo;And to your seed,&rdquo; who is Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ is the unique seed inheriting the promises that all the nations of the earth might be blessed. The physical aspect of the blessing was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ; the spiritual aspect of the blessing is the Spirit (Gal. 3:14). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the promised land. Therefore, God gave Abraham the promise of grace in order that the new race would hope in the Christ who would come to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. Gaining the First Part<br />
of the New Race of the New Creation</h2>
<p>Through His work of the new creation from Adam to Moses in the age of the patriarchs, God obtained the chosen patriarchs as the first part of the new race in His new creation, signified by the crown of twelve stars worn on the head of the universal woman in Revelation 12, for the building of the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s expression in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After God created all things and mankind according to His eternal plan, His economy, He uses four distinct dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom&mdash;to do His work of the new creation on the man whom He created in order to accomplish the purpose of His eternal economy. The dispensation of the patriarchs was from the creation of Adam to the giving of the law by Moses. In this dispensation, God first put the created man under His direct government that man might receive Him as life; then He caused the fallen man, the function of whose conscience had been activated by the knowledge of good and evil, to receive His redemption in Christ. He also caused man to be governed by his own conscience and to be acceptable to Him through sacrifices according to the way of redemption that He ordained. Moreover, He caused man to enjoy His riches by calling on His name so that he might walk and work with Him. Then He subjected the repeatedly fallen man under the authority which He gave to man, causing him to be ruled by man that he might live and be preserved and that He might have the opportunity to visit man. Finally, He called the new race out of the Adamic race, which was fallen to the uttermost, and gave them the promise of grace, leading them to hope in the Christ who would come to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth. In this way, God obtained the chosen patriarchs to be the first part of the new race in His new creation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE REASON</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace. However, because fallen man did not know his own weakness and corruption and therefore did not realize his impotence and his need of God&rsquo;s grace, God temporarily changed the way of His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation. That is, He gave the fallen man the law, which was established according to what He is. Thus, in His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to the coming of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE INTENTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in setting up the dispensation of law according to His economy was to accomplish the following things through the law:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Keep the Chosen People in Custody</h2>
<p>From the time that God called Abraham to be the father of a new race in God&rsquo;s new creation to the completion of the grace that He promised to Abraham was a long period of approximately two thousand years. Four hundred thirty years after He gave Abraham the promise, the descendants of Abraham, the chosen people of God, became foolish and stubborn. Knowing neither themselves nor the grace of God, they were arrogant and stiff-necked. Therefore, on the one hand, God caused His chosen people to contact Him and to fellowship with Him through Christ, who was typified by the tabernacle and the offerings, that they might enjoy the riches in Christ as the grace that He promised to Abraham. On the other hand, He preserved them in the divine economy by giving them, through Moses, the holy and righteous law, which was established according to Himself, who is love and light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. That They Might Satisfy<br />
the Requirements of the Law<br />
through the Offerings, Which Typified Christ,<br />
and Thereby Be Guarded</h2>
<p>God did not decree the law that His chosen people might keep it by themselves; rather, His intention was that they would satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded. After He gave the law to the children of Israel, He began to deal with them according to the law through the offerings and the tabernacle. He did not intend for them to contact Him through the law; rather, He intended for them to contact Him according to the law through the offerings and the tabernacle. This is the fulfillment in type of the grace which God promised to Abraham. Suppose an Israelite committed a certain sin. According to the law, that one should be condemned, perhaps even put to death. However, the sinner could present a trespass offering, which was a type of Christ. The trespass offering was then offered on the altar by the priest. In this way the sinner could be forgiven. Therefore, he was not cut off by God; rather, because he had satisfied the righteous requirements of the law through union with the sacrifice, which typified Christ, he was blessed and was able to contact and fellowship with God, be at peace and be one with Him, and enjoy His riches. Thus, he was kept in the way of God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. That They Might Be Guarded as the Flock<br />
Is Guarded in the Sheepfold</h2>
<p>Through Moses God gave the law as the custodian of His chosen people, to guard them as the sheepfold guards the flock. Before Christ came, God&rsquo;s chosen people were watched over and guarded under law, as the sheep are watched over and kept in custody in the temporary sheepfold (since the pasture is the permanent place for them to stay), so that the thieves may not come to steal, kill, or destroy them (John 10:10). Persons such as Moses, Samuel, David, and the prophets and saints in the Old Testament were all kept by the law in this way.</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Provide the Chosen People<br />
with a Child-conductor</h2>
<p>The positive function of the God-given law was, on the one hand, to keep the chosen people of God in custody for fifteen hundred years, and, on the other hand, to provide them with a child-conductor.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Lead Them to Christ</h2>
<p>God caused the law to be the child-conductor of His chosen people in order to lead them to Christ (Gal. 3:24). In the original language, child-conductor means escort, guardian, custodian, one who cares for a child under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster. The law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and conduct them to Christ when He did come. For example, the prophet Simeon and the prophetess Anna, having been taught by the law, looked and waited for Christ and were thus led to Christ (Luke 2:25-26, 36-38); God&rsquo;s chosen people, and John the Baptist in particular, also looked and waited for Christ, proving that they all were under the instruction of the law (Luke 3:15; 7:19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Lead Them<br />
to Receive God&rsquo;s Forgiveness<br />
through the Offerings</h2>
<p>God caused the law to be the child-conductor of His chosen people. Therefore, on the one hand, they were taught by the law to look and wait for Christ. On the other hand, when the devout ones among them did their best to keep the law, they realized their impotence, shortage, and failures, because they committed sins through their deeds (Psa. 51:2-4) and had the sin that they inherited by birth in their nature (Psa. 51:5); hence, they presented the offerings, which typify Christ, to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness. By presenting the trespass offering (which signifies Christ bearing the sins of the people and receiving God&rsquo;s judgment on the cross on behalf of man, thus dealing with the sins in man&rsquo;s actions&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18), they received forgiveness for their sinful deeds (Lev. 5:1-19; Isa. 53:5-6, 10-11). Moreover, by presenting the sin offering (which signifies Christ being made sin on behalf of man and causing sin to be condemned through His death on the cross, thus dealing with the sin in man&rsquo;s nature&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3), they received God&rsquo;s forgiveness for their nature (Lev. 4:1-35). Therefore, as the child-conductor of God&rsquo;s chosen people, the law also led them to obtain God&rsquo;s forgiveness through the offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Lead Them to Enjoy<br />
the Riches of God through the Tabernacle<br />
and the Temple</h2>
<p>The law also led the devout ones in the Old Testament to come before God to contact Him and thereby enjoy all His riches through the tabernacle and the temple, both of which typify Christ (John 1:14; 2:21). This matter is revealed and portrayed especially in the Psalms. The psalmists were devout people who were instructed by the law and who were forgiven by God through the offerings. Because they loved God (Psa. 18:1), sought God (Psa. 42:1-2), loved the habitation of God&rsquo;s house and the place where His glory dwelt (Psa. 26:8, Heb.), and longed to be with God and to behold His beauty (Psa. 27:4), they were infused with the riches of God in God&rsquo;s house (Psa. 52:8). They were planted in the house of Jehovah, they flourished in the courts of God, they brought forth fruits, and they were full of sap and green (Psa. 92:13-14, Heb.). Furthermore, they were abundantly satisfied with the fatness of His house, and they drank of the river of His pleasures, enjoying His riches (Psa. 36:8-9).</p>
<p>The psalmists considered the law of God to be the living word of God (Exo. 34:28). As revealed in Psalm 119, they believed in the word (v. 66), chose it (v. 30), loved it (vv. 47-48, 97), tasted it (v. 103), rejoiced in it (v. 14), sang it, praised it (v. 54), sought it (vv. 45, 94), longed for it (vv. 20, 40), hoped in it (vv. 43, 74), and trusted in it (v. 42). Therefore, through the living word of God they were enlightened (v. 135); they received the life supply, the enlivening, and the quickening (vv. 25, 50); they were watered by the word (Psa. 1:3); and they received other blessings, such as restoration (Psa. 19:7a), deliverance (119:41), strength (v. 28), comfort (v. 76), nourishment (v. 103), upholding (v. 117), and safeguarding. Moreover, they enjoyed God as their portion (v. 57); they had knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and discernment (vv. 66, 98-100); they were preserved from sin (v. 11), from stumbling (v. 165, Heb.), and from every evil way (v. 101); their footsteps were established; and they were made the overcoming saints (v. 133).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Cause the Chosen People to Have<br />
the Knowledge of Sin and of Themselves</h2>
<p>The New Testament clearly indicates that God&rsquo;s original intention was to deal with His chosen people according to grace and not according to law.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Law Being Added</h2>
<p>The law was not in God&rsquo;s original intention, nor was it God&rsquo;s original ordination for man. It was added later along the way because of transgression (Rom. 5:20; Gal. 3:19). God originally did not have the intention to deal with man according to the law; rather, the law was added because of man&rsquo;s fall and corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Through the Law<br />
Being the Knowledge of Sin</h2>
<p>The function of God&rsquo;s giving the law, on the negative side, was for man to have the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20). God gave the law to the children of Israel, not for them to keep but for them to transgress, in order to expose their wickedness. While God was giving the law, they fashioned a golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai and worshipped that idol, thus violating the first three of the Ten Commandments of the law. After Moses received God&rsquo;s law, he came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of stone, on which were written the Ten Commandments of the law; but upon seeing the people worshipping the idol, he broke the two tablets of the law. That indicated that when the law was received, or while it was being received, or even before it was received, it was already transgressed and broken by the people. Therefore, God&rsquo;s intention in giving them the law was that they would transgress it so that their offense might be shown, even that it might abound (Rom. 5:20). This was to expose their fallen condition, thus causing them to have the knowledge of sin. Without the law, man cannot know what sin is (Rom. 7:7). But when the law comes, man not only can know what sin is, but he can know what kind of sin he has committed. Like a mirror, the law reflects the true condition of a man that he may know himself. The law does not make a person evil; rather, it merely exposes the evil that is already in him. Therefore, the negative aspect of the function of the law is that man may have the knowledge of sin and thereby flee to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Through the Law Being the Knowledge of Self<br />
and the Realization of the Need of Grace</h2>
<p>Since the law causes man to have the knowledge of sin, it causes him to know himself and thereby sense his need of God&rsquo;s grace. Under the exposure of the law, man knows that he is fleshly, that he is sold under sin (Rom. 7:14), and that in his flesh nothing good dwells (Rom. 7:18). What he does, he does not acknowledge; what he wills, this he does not practice; but what he hates, this he does (Rom. 7:15). To will is present with him, but to do the good is not (Rom. 7:18). He can only cry out hopelessly, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; (Rom. 7:24). Therefore, the law causes man to know the true condition of his weakness and impotence; consequently, it causes man to deeply realize and sense his need of God&rsquo;s grace. Thus, man receives God that He might bear all his responsibilities and allows God to work Himself into him to be his element and to work through him to accomplish His purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Bringing in Christ</h2>
<p>In the dispensation of law, not only were God&rsquo;s chosen people guarded by the law, but Christ was brought in under law to the chosen people who waited for Him in that dispensation (Luke 2:25), and to those who would believe into Him in the coming dispensation. In that dispensation of law, under law, Christ was born under law of a virgin who piously kept the law (Luke 1:27-33; Gal. 4:4), and He was circumcised, named, and presented to God according to the law (Luke 2:21-24). He also lived under law as a law-abiding, lawful, proper, and perfect Man (Luke 2:40-52). Eventually, according to the requirements of the law, He went to the cross to accomplish redemption for God (John 19:28), terminating and replacing the law (Rom. 10:4). Thus, He transferred both God&rsquo;s chosen people in the Old Testament and those who believe into Him in the New Testament from the law of the old covenant to the grace of the new covenant (Rom. 6:14), that they should not be guarded and enslaved under law any longer, but rather enjoy the grace and freedom in Him (Gal. 5:1-4; Rom. 5:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Obtaining the Second Part of the New Race<br />
of the New Creation</h2>
<p>In the dispensation of law, God also obtained the pious men and the righteous men, those who fully kept the law under the law of the old covenant through the tabernacle and the offerings, both of which typified Christ. These, as Zachariah and Elizabeth, were righteous and blameless in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances (Luke 1:5-6). They were blameless, but not without blemish, not without sin and sins. They still needed the unblemished sin offering and trespass offering (Lev. 4:28; 5:15), which were types of Christ, for their atonement that they might have contact with God. Moreover, through the tabernacle and the temple they came before God to enjoy all His riches, that is, to enjoy God as the source of life and the supply of life (Psa. 36:7-9). Thus, they were kept in the way of God&rsquo;s new creation. In this way, God obtained this group of people who are typified by the moon underneath the feet of the universal woman in Revelation 12, as the second part of the new race of the new creation, to constitute the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s eternal expression in the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace. However, because the fallen man did not know his weakness and corruption, and therefore did not realize his impotence and his need of God&rsquo;s grace, God temporarily changed the way of His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation. That is, He gave the fallen man the law, which was established according to what He is. Thus, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to Christ. God&rsquo;s intention in setting up this dispensation of law according to His economy was to accomplish the following things through the law; first, to keep the chosen people in custody that they might satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded, as sheep are guarded in the sheepfold; second, to provide the chosen people with a child-conductor that they might be led to Christ, that through the offerings they might be forgiven, and that through the tabernacle and temple they might enjoy God&rsquo;s riches; and third, to cause the chosen people to have the knowledge of sin and of themselves, and thereby realize and sense their need of God&rsquo;s grace. As a result, God kept His chosen people in the custody of the law, obtained the second part of the new race of the new creation, and brought Christ to the chosen people who waited for Him in the dispensation of law and to those who would believe into Him in the coming dispensation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>When God determined that the purpose of decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, that is, at the fullness of the time (Gal. 4:4), He became flesh, thus terminating the dispensation of law and inaugurating the dispensation of grace. At that time, God again changed the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation by replacing the demand of the law with the supply of grace. The dispensation of grace is from Christ&rsquo;s first coming to His second coming, which marks the beginning of the millennial kingdom. This is also the dispensation of the mystery of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING FLESH IN THE SON</h2>
<p>The dispensation of grace began with the Triune God becoming flesh in the Son. In eternity past, this One who became flesh was the eternal Word who was with God (John 1:1-2), the only begotten Son who expressed God (John 1:18), and the Author of life (Acts 3:15). In time, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin and was born as a God-man (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20), who is both the complete God (Rom. 9:5) and the perfect Man (Matt. 1:1). On the one hand, His source is God, and on the other hand, His source is man. Hence, He was born with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. This word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; not only indicates His nature, but even more, His essence. His essence consists of the divine nature plus the human nature, that is, the divine essence plus the human essence. He is the entire Triune God becoming the complete Man, bringing God into man, that is, bringing God Himself to man to be enjoyed as grace and to be received as reality (John 1:17), thus replacing the law of the previous dispensation.</p>
<p>The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet God&rsquo;s demand. No one can partake of God through the law, but grace enables man to enjoy God. The law is only a testimony of what God is (Exo. 25:21); reality is the realization of what God is. Therefore, reality is God realized, and grace is God enjoyed. The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TRIUNE GOD PASSING THROUGH<br />
HUMAN LIVING IN HUMANITY</h2>
<p>The Triune God not only became flesh in the Son but also passed through human living in humanity. While Christ was living on the earth, the complete Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was in Him, living a mingled life with Him as a perfect man. On the one hand, He experienced the hardships and sufferings of human living; on the other hand, He lived out God and expressed God in humanity. As a man, He grew up in the home of a poor carpenter and lived among men for thirty-three and a half years. He fully tasted the sufferings, sorrows, trials, and temptations of human life. He also contacted different kinds of people, such as the moral (John 3:1), the immoral (John 4:17-18), the dying (John 4:47), the sick and impotent (John 5:5), the hungry (John 6:26-27), the thirsty (John 7:37), those under the bondage of sin (John 8:3, 34), the blind (John 9:1), and even the dead (John 11:39), and He gave life to them to meet all their needs. In His human virtues He expressed the divine attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. He lived as a man, yet He lived out God; He was the Triune God with all His virtues lived out in humanity and manifested in human form. He was the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9; John 16:15a), He was the tabernacle of God and the temple of God (John 1:14a; 2:21), He was coinherent with the Father (John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21), He was one with the Father (John 10:30; 17:22), He had the Father with Him (John 8:29; 16:32), He lived because of the Father (John 6:57a), He was anointed with the Spirit by the Father (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18a), He worked with the Father (John 14:10b; 5:17, 19), He did things in the name of the Father (John 10:25), He did the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30; 6:38), He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word (John 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50), He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory (John 7:18), and He expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). This was the living of the mingling of God and man that was lived out by the Triune God when He passed through human living in humanity.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TRIUNE GOD PASSING THROUGH<br />
THE DEATH OF THE CROSS IN HUMANITY</h2>
<p>In order to bring grace and reality to man, the Triune God needed not only to become flesh in the Son and to pass through human living in humanity, but also to pass through the death of the cross in humanity. His death was not the death of an ordinary man; it was the death of a God-man, and it was all-inclusive. He died on the cross with a sevenfold status to accomplish an all-inclusive death for all men and for everything that He redeemed. This death is of two aspects: the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life impartation, which are signified by the blood and water that came out of His side when He was pierced on the cross (John 19:34).</p>
<p>First, He died as the Lamb of God to deal with the totality of sin, including our sinful nature and sinful deeds (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3).</p>
<p>Second, He died as One who became flesh (John 1:14), in the likeness of the flesh of sin, in the form of fallen man, to cause sin to be condemned and to deal with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<p>Third, He died as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b), as a man in the old creation, for us, who are in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Fourth, as the brass serpent, having the serpent&rsquo;s form but not the serpent&rsquo;s poison, He was lifted up, and through His death on the cross He bruised the head of the ancient serpent (Gen. 3:15; Rev. 12:9), destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14) and his world (John 12:31), thus causing all those who believe in Him to have eternal life (John 3:14-15).</p>
<p>Fifth, as the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), He died on the cross in the old creation to terminate the entire old creation, thus reconciling all created things to God (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>Sixth, as the Peacemaker, He abolished, through the cross, all the regulating and separating ordinances of the law, such as those concerning circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and eating certain foods, and including the different ways of living, different customs, different habits, and different ways of worship, which cause separations in human society. Thus He created all His believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man (Eph. 2:14-16).</p>
<p>The six items above are on the negative side, the side of redemption, and solve all problems for us, the fallen sinners.</p>
<p>Seventh, on the positive side, the side of life impartation, He, as a grain of wheat, fell into the ground and died to release the divine life (John 12:24) for multiplication and increase that we, like Him, may become the many grains of wheat to be formed into one loaf as the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17a), which is the church, to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression. Thus, He accomplished an all-inclusive death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TRIUNE GOD BEING RAISED<br />
FROM AMONG THE DEAD<br />
WITH A RESURRECTED BODY IN HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Not only did the Triune God pass through the death of the cross in humanity, but He was also raised from among the dead with a resurrected body in humanity. The constituents of this God-man are the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Man Jesus. When He was put to death on the cross, His spirit was not put to death, but His flesh was put to death (1 Pet. 3:18). He was likened to a grain of wheat (John 12:24). The Man Jesus was the shell of the grain of wheat, within which were the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. While He was suffering death, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were doing the work of resurrection in Him. This was the beginning of the resurrection of Christ. Then, His divine resurrection power set His soul free from Hades and enabled His body to leave the tomb; hence, His whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;was resurrected. Therefore, His resurrection began with His spirit, passed through His soul, and consummated in His body.</p>
<p>Thus, through death and resurrection God caused His only begotten Son to be born as the Firstborn of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29) in His humanity in resurrection. Christ was the only begotten Son of God; then in His incarnation He was born of a virgin to be the Son of Man (John 1:14; Matt. 1:23; Luke 19:10). According to His divinity, He was the Son of God; according to His humanity, He was the Son of Man. His humanity was not a part of Him as the Son of God; it was a part of Him as the Son of Man. Therefore, His humanity needed to be begotten as the Son of God through death and resurrection that He might be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers. At the same time, in the resurrection of the firstborn Son of God all those who believed into Him were regenerated to become the many sons of God to form the house of God for the kingdom of God and to constitute the Body of Christ as the corporate expression of the Triune God in the Son.</p><h2 class="head1">V. CHRIST, WHO WAS RESURRECTED<br />
TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,<br />
BREATHING HIMSELF INTO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Through resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit; then He breathed Himself into those who believed in Him to make them His members. On the night of His resurrection He came to the disciples and breathed Himself, the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, as breath into them (John 20:22). This breath was the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, whom Christ had become in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). He breathed Himself into the disciples to be the reality of their spiritual life for their spiritual existence and living. Such a Christ, who passed through death, entered into resurrection, and became the Spirit, is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Because He breathed Himself into the disciples, He is with them forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE RESURRECTED AND GLORIFIED CHRIST<br />
BEING EXALTED IN ASCENSION</h2>
<p>Through resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Moreover, His resurrection was His glorification. Through His resurrection, His divinity was released from the shell of His humanity, which concealed His glory, enabling Him to enter into the divine glory with His humanity (Luke 24:26; 1 Cor. 15:43); that is, He was glorified by God in resurrection (Acts 3:13, 15a).</p>
<p>This resurrected and glorified Christ appeared to the disciples for forty days. Afterwards, on Mount Olivet, outside of Jerusalem, He ascended into heaven in a cloud before the eyes of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11). In His ascension, through the surpassingly great power of God (Eph. 1:19), Christ ascended above all the heavens (Eph. 4:10) and sat down on the right hand of God, the Majesty on high (Psa. 110:1a; Heb. 1:3b). He was exalted by God to the throne of God&rsquo;s dominion (Rev. 3:21) to rule over and administrate the universe for God and was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Furthermore, God made Him both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:33-36) that He might possess all and that He might carry out God&rsquo;s commission and accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. God also made Him a Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31) to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to man and to exercise His sovereign rule over the world, that the environment might be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive Him as their Savior and enjoy His salvation. Thus, according to the eternal redemption which He accomplished, He is able to save those who repent and turn to God and who believe into Him, that they may enjoy His salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE ASCENDED CHRIST POURING HIMSELF OUT<br />
AS THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Christ, who was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit and was glorified, after His exaltation in ascension, poured Himself out as the consummated Spirit of the Triune God, baptizing all His believers, who became His members, into one Body in the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). First, on the day of Pentecost, He baptized the Jewish believers into Himself as the consummated Spirit (Acts 2:4); then, in the house of Cornelius, He baptized the Gentile believers also into Himself as the consummated Spirit (Acts 10:44-45). Thus, by these two steps He baptized all the believers in Christ once for all into Himself as the consummated Spirit and into His one Body as His fullness, enlargement, and continuation to express Him. This outpouring is economical, not essential; it is for power and administration, not for life and existence. Therefore, the ascended Christ as the consummated Spirit poured Himself out upon the believers to clothe them as their outward power and authority that they might testify of Him and spread forth the gospel to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. PREACHING TO SINNERS<br />
THE ABOVE SEVEN ITEMS AS THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The above seven items include mainly the Person and work of Christ, that is, what this living person, the God-man, is, what He does, and all that He has attained and obtained, all of which constitute the gospel. Therefore, this gospel is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47) because it brings forgiveness of sins to those who believe in Him. It is the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) because it brings the Triune God as grace to man. It is the gospel of life (2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 4:15) because it manifests life and incorruption and regenerates man, imparting the divine life into man. And it is the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 4:23; 24:14) because it brings in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The early apostles and disciples preached to sinners this mysterious One as the multifaceted gospel, calling those who were chosen by God to believe into Him, to be saved, and to be regenerated.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. CONSTITUTING THE SAVED<br />
AND REGENERATED ONES TO BE THE CHURCHES<br />
IN DIFFERENT PLACES</h2>
<p>God is constituting all those who have believed into this gospel and are saved and regenerated to be the churches in different places. God&rsquo;s eternal desire is to gain a group of people in the universe, the saved ones throughout the generations, that they may be the Body of Christ as a vessel to express Christ and that He Himself also may be expressed in Christ. This is the purpose that God desires to achieve in the universe. In order to achieve this purpose, God establishes the churches in different places, first in Jerusalem, then in such places as Samaria, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome, each place having one church. God&rsquo;s intention is that every local church should be a miniature of His universal church, being exactly the same as the universal church in nature and in principle. Each of these churches in the different localities represents the universal church locally, expressing Christ and bearing His testimony according to the principle of the universal church, that the Body of Christ may be completely built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. OBTAINING THE THIRD PART OF THE NEW RACE</h2>
<p>In the dispensation of grace God obtains all those who believe into Christ in the New Testament as the third part and the majority of the new race in God&rsquo;s new creation, signified by the sun with which the universal woman is clothed in Revelation 12, for the accomplishment of the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s ultimate and full expression in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When God determined that the purpose of decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, the Triune God became flesh in the Son; He was born of a woman to become Christ, who possessed both the divine nature and the human nature, bringing grace and reality. He passed through human life in humanity, experiencing every hardship and suffering, and He also lived out the Triune God in humanity. Furthermore, He passed through the death of the cross in humanity, accomplishing an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status and releasing the divine life for multiplication and increase to constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church. Moreover, the Triune God was raised from among the dead with a resurrected body in humanity, that the only begotten Son might be born as the firstborn Son in His humanity in resurrection; at the same time, those who believed into Christ were regenerated to become His many sons. This Christ, who was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, breathed Himself into those who believed in Him to be the reality of their spiritual life for their spiritual existence and living. Then this resurrected and glorified One was exalted in ascension. He was made both Lord and Christ to be a Leader and Savior, that He might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&rsquo;s chosen people. Moreover, in ascension He poured Himself out as the consummated Spirit of the Triune God, baptizing those who believed and became His members in this consummated Spirit into one Body, that they might be His fullness to express Him. The above seven items mainly include the person and work of Christ and constitute the gospel of God to be preached to sinners, calling those who were chosen of God to believe, to be saved, and to be regenerated. God then constitutes them to be the churches in different localities that the Body of Christ may be fully built up. Thus God obtains all those who believe into Christ in the New Testament to be the third part of the new race in God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After the conclusion of the dispensation of grace, God will change for the last time the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will set up His kingdom on the earth (Rev. 11:15) to carry out His administration and by His absolute righteousness bring to a conclusion the different kinds of people among the human race, that He may accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation. This dispensation is called the dispensation of the kingdom. In this dispensation, righteousness will reign as king; hence, this dispensation is also called the dispensation of righteousness. It will begin with the second coming of Christ and end with the putting away of the old heaven and old earth, the old universe, covering a period of one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. REWARDING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
THE JUST MEN PERFECTED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the first two dispensations, the dispensation of the patriarchs and the dispensation of law, God obtained a group of perfected just men, the overcomers in the Old Testament, who are able to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to participate in Christ&rsquo;s kingship and joy.</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the patriarchs, all those who took God&rsquo;s ordained way by faith according to God&rsquo;s promise were perfected to become the overcomers in their times. They were the fathers, such as Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moreover, in the dispensation of law, the devout and just men, who absolutely kept the law by the offerings and the tabernacle, both of which typify Christ, were also perfected to become the overcomers in their times. Such men were Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and others who were perfected by God in the Old Testament, as mentioned in Hebrews 11. They all will receive the Lord&rsquo;s reward and enter into the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom to enjoy the kingdom feast (Matt. 8:11) and to be co-kings with Christ (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. REWARDING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS IN CHRIST<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the dispensation of grace God is also gaining the overcoming believers in Christ, who will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, becoming its main part, to be co-kings with Christ, ruling over the nations on the earth in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>The New Testament clearly indicates that before God the believers must not only deal with the matter of salvation but also with the matter of reward and punishment (Luke 19:22-26; Matt. 24:45-51; 25:1-30; Luke 12:42-48; 2 Cor. 5:9-10; 1 Cor. 4:5). When the dispensation of the kingdom comes, all believers must face this issue. We need to solemnly take the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the reward and punishment of the kingdom that we may be warned, encouraged, and attracted to press on toward Christ and to be the overcomers that we may receive a prize in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of Receiving a Reward</h2>
<p>According to the Scriptures, the significance of receiving a reward includes at least five aspects. First, to receive a reward is to receive a crown. There are different crowns: the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), the crown of life (Rev. 2:10), the crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4), the incorruptible crown (1 Cor. 9:25), and the crown of joy (1 Thes. 2:19; Phil. 4:1). The crown of righteousness will be awarded to those who faithfully follow the Lord and who love His appearing. It is called the crown of righteousness because it will be given by the Lord, the righteous Judge, to His faithful lovers. The crown of life will be awarded to those who suffer martyrdom for the Lord, caring not for their own lives and being faithful unto death, so that they may manifest forever the Lord&rsquo;s powerful life, which is incorruptible (2 Tim. 1:10), which cannot be held by death, and which has passed through death and resurrection, proving that they have overcome death. The crown of glory will be awarded to those who willingly shepherd the Lord&rsquo;s flock today. Since they care for the Lord&rsquo;s intention and look after God&rsquo;s flock, the Lord will give them the crown of glory that they may eternally express the glory of God, which is God Himself, in the universe. The incorruptible crown will be awarded to those who forsake the earthly joys to run the Lord&rsquo;s way. In order to run the Lord&rsquo;s way, they forsake all the temporary things of this world, things which are corruptible and which will pass away. Hence, the Lord will give them an incorruptible crown, declaring eternally that what they choose today is a glorious blessing which will last forever and which will never pass away. The crown of joy will be a reward to those who care for the Lord&rsquo;s believers. Since they care for people&rsquo;s souls and for people&rsquo;s condition before the Lord, the Lord will make those whom they have cared for their crown of joy, testifying eternally in the universe to all their labor on others for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Second, the significance of receiving a reward is to sit on the throne. This is the prize that the Lord, when He sits on the throne of His glory to exercise His authority, will give to the twelve disciples who forsook everything to follow Him (Matt. 19:28). It is also the prize that the Lord will give to all overcoming believers (Rev. 3:21). Every overcoming believer in this age will receive from the Lord the reward of sitting with Him on His throne.</p>
<p>Third, the significance of receiving a reward is to receive authority. This is the prize that the Lord will award to the believers who overcome and who keep His commandments until the end (Rev. 2:26). They steadfastly keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments to be the overcomers in the present age, when the church is in desolation and the world is in opposition to the Lord. Therefore, when the Lord rules over the world, He will give them authority over the nations, and they will reign over them with Him (Rev. 2:27). This is also the reward that the Lord will give to those who work faithfully for Him; some will have authority over ten cities, and others will have authority over five cities (Luke 19:17, 19).</p>
<p>Fourth, the significance of receiving a reward is to be a king. If we can endure sufferings and difficulties for the Lord in this age, we will also reign with Him in the coming age (2 Tim. 2:12). Throughout the generations all those who faithfully bear the testimony for the Lord, even suffering martyrdom for Him, will be co-kings with Him to reign over the world. This will be in the millennium. Therefore, kingship is also a prize which the Lord will give to the believers.</p>
<p>Fifth, the significance of receiving a reward is to be a priest. Those who faithfully bear the testimony for the Lord today, even giving up their lives for Him, will not only reign with Him but also be priests of God and of Christ (Rev. 20:6). In the millennium the Lord will give them a twofold status and qualification of honor. On the one hand, they will be kings, and on the other hand, they will be priests. As kings they will represent God before man, bringing God&rsquo;s authority to man; as priests they will represent man before God, bringing man&rsquo;s service to God. As kings they will participate in God&rsquo;s reign to carry out God&rsquo;s administration; as priests they will partake of God&rsquo;s life to obtain God Himself, thus enjoying the topmost blessing in the universe, which is God Himself. Both of these blessings of honor are included in the reward which the Lord will give to the overcomers.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Conditions for Receiving a Reward</h2>
<p>The Lord will give us a reward according to righteousness. It will not be given to us in the same way as salvation is given, according to grace. Since God&rsquo;s salvation is according to grace, we receive it freely. However, since the Lord&rsquo;s reward is according to righteousness, we must pay a considerable price to obtain it. The Scriptures contain many conditions for obtaining the reward, but in this lesson we will mention only the more important ones.</p>
<p>First, we will receive a reward according to our own labor (1 Cor. 3:8). Since the Lord&rsquo;s giving us a reward will be according to His righteousness, our obtaining the reward must be according to our own labor. After we are saved, if what we produce before the Lord is gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12), the Lord will give us a reward. In the Bible, gold refers to the divine nature (Exo. 25:11, 17-18, 24, 31), silver, to redemption (Exo. 30:16), and precious stones, to the expression of God&rsquo;s glorious image (Rev. 4:3; 21:11). Therefore, a work which is of gold, silver, and precious stones is a work which is of God and which corresponds to God&rsquo;s nature, a work which is according to the principle of God&rsquo;s redemption, and a work which is able to express God, manifesting the glory of God. If what we produce is wood, grass, and stubble, which is of man, of the flesh, and full of the earthly element and condition, we will not receive a reward from the Lord; rather, we will suffer loss.</p>
<p>Second, we will receive a reward according to our work (Rev. 22:12). This shows us that although receiving salvation does not require work, receiving a reward does. Whether we will receive a reward from the Lord depends on whether we have the work that is pleasing to Him. Such a work is the surpassing righteousness that we live out by His life (Matt. 5:20). How great a reward we will receive from the Lord also depends on how much of our work is pleasing to Him.</p>
<p>Third, we will receive a prize because we are faithful to the Lord unto death, not caring for our lives (Rev. 2:10-11). The believers&rsquo; ability to be faithful unto death, overcoming Satan&rsquo;s infliction of death, is an issue of their living by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. Because of this, they will receive the crown of life to enjoy the glory of life and not be hurt by the second death.</p>
<p>Fourth, we will receive a reward because we overcome (Rev. 2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-27; 3:5, 11-12, 21). The overcoming that the Lord requires is the victory that we achieve in fighting against anything that opposes His testimony and damages His kingdom. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony rests with the church that He loves. His intention is to bring in the kingdom He treasures through the church He loves. Satan knows this and has been trying his best to frustrate the Lord&rsquo;s intention. Therefore, the Lord wants us to fight for this and to overcome. Since this overcoming is necessary to the bringing in of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, overcoming becomes indispensable to our receiving a prize and entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Our overcoming includes the following items: recovering the first love toward the Lord; enduring persecution or tribulations to be faithful unto death; not mingling with the world, rejecting hierarchy, and leaving the worldly organization of Christianity; removing the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church and not being contaminated by the defilement of idols and spiritual fornication; overcoming coldness, deadness, and decline; striving to keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance and not denying His name; and not being self-satisfied, but humbly pursuing, opening our heart to let the Lord in to gain the ground in us and have fellowship with us. All these are conditions for receiving the reward. Only the overcomers can enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to be enthroned. The defeated believers in the present dark and evil world will not be allowed to reign in the coming kingdom, which is of light and of righteousness. Those who are not able to be the overcomers in this age of desolation will not be able to be the rulers in the coming age of restoration. God&rsquo;s ordination is that we must first fight and overcome, then we will reign.</p>
<p>Fifth, we will receive a reward because we love His appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). To love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and to love the Lord Himself are inseparable. If we truly love the Lord, we will love His appearing. All those who love the Lord and forsake everything for Him love also His appearing, that they may receive His reward; those who do not love the Lord, but love the world or love sin, are afraid of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Therefore, loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing is a proof that we love the Lord and live for Him today; hence, it also becomes a condition for us to receive His reward.</p><h2 class="head2">C. An Example in Pursuing the Reward</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, the most obvious example in pursuing the reward is Paul. He ran with a definite direction, and he boxed, not as beating the air. He also buffeted his body and led it as a slave. He did this because he was pursuing a prize. He was afraid that in preaching to others the word concerning the prize, he himself would become disapproved and be unable to obtain the prize (1 Cor. 9:26-27). In order to gain the Lord&rsquo;s reward, he endeavored to run, but even in his old age, when he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians during his imprisonment, he still did not have the boldness to say that he had obtained the reward. In Philippians chapter one, he was full of confidence concerning his salvation (Phil. 1:19), but in chapter three he was still not sure concerning his obtaining the prize (Phil. 3:13-14). Hence, although he had attained maturity to a considerable extent, he still paid attention to one thing, that is, forgetting the things which were behind and stretching forward to the things which were before, he pursued toward the goal for the prize.</p>
<p>At the time he wrote 2 Timothy, he had reached the end of his course and was about to suffer martyrdom for the Lord. Only then was he able to boldly declare that he would receive the prize. He had fought the Lord&rsquo;s good fight, he had finished the Lord&rsquo;s course, and he had kept the Lord&rsquo;s faith. At that time he knew with confidence that the Lord had reserved for him the crown of righteousness, that is, the prize of righteousness, which would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (2 Tim. 4:6-8).</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not be deceived into believing that once we are saved, everything will be all right. Our salvation cannot be more secure than Paul&rsquo;s. And yet, after he was saved, Paul endeavored to run and continued to pursue, because besides salvation there was also the matter of receiving the prize. We should take him as our example of one who strove for and pursued after the prize.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. PERFECTING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
THE IMMATURE BELIEVERS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>When the dispensation of the kingdom comes, on the one hand, Christ will reward, according to righteousness, the overcoming believers in Christ, and on the other hand, He will perfect, according to righteousness, the immature believers in the New Testament, disciplining them (Matt. 24:48-51; 25:26-30) that they may pursue maturity in life and come to perfection.</p>
<p>Many believers think that when the Lord comes back, at the time of the millennium, all the problems will have been resolved. Actually, when the Lord comes again, He will still chasten and discipline the immature believers. To be sure, today the Lord also chastens and disciplines the believers (1 Cor. 11:31-32; Heb. 12:5-11), but He will do so even more at His coming back. In fact, according to the biblical teaching, the discipline which the Lord gives to the believers today is fragmentary, partial, and incomplete, but at His coming again, it will be entire, whole, and complete. Therefore, the Lord chastens and disciplines the believers not only in the dispensation of grace today, but He will do so also in the coming dispensation of the kingdom. According to His righteousness and for His righteousness&rsquo; sake, the Lord will discipline and perfect the believers who, in the present age of grace, neglect His grace and are unwilling to be faithful in the pursuit of perfection on the way of His grace. God&rsquo;s disciplining and perfecting work will cause the believers who previously would not seek maturity in the divine life, to have maturity in life that they may be qualified to enter into the new heaven and new earth to be the constituents of the New Jerusalem. Thus, they will be able to share together with the believers who have matured earlier the enjoyment of the blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life in its ultimate consummation in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. DEALING, ACCORDING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
WITH ALL THE ISRAELITES WHO REPENT<br />
AND RECEIVE CHRIST AT HIS COMING BACK</h2>
<p>At Christ&rsquo;s second coming all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:26). They will be saved by repenting and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name through God&rsquo;s pouring out of the Holy Spirit (Zech. 12:10; Acts 2:18-21). According to the new covenant which God has made with them, they will be saved and regenerated; they will receive the law of life, a new heart, a new spirit, and God&rsquo;s Spirit (Jer. 31:31, 33; Ezek. 36:26-27). Hence, in the aspect of being saved and regenerated they will be just like the New Testament believers. However, because they will be saved after the church has been raptured, they will not be included in the church and thus will be unable to join the overcomers of both the Old and New Testaments in entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennial kingdom to reign as kings; they will be able only to enter the earthly section of the millennial kingdom to serve as priests, teaching the nations, who are the subjects, how to serve and worship God (Zech. 8:20-23). This is the way God will deal, according to righteousness, with all the Israelites who will repent and receive Christ at His coming back.</p><h2 class="head1">V. COMPLETING GOD&rsquo;S WORK OF THE NEW CREATION<br />
ON THE MAN OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>The dispensation of the kingdom, which is the dispensation of righteousness, is only an age of restoration (Acts 3:21), and as such it is still a dispensation in the old heaven and old earth of the old creation. It will be used by God to chasten, to discipline, and to perfect the believers. It is not in the new heaven and new earth that all the work of the new creation will be completed. God will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will cause the immature believers in the dispensation of grace to mature in life, and He will cause the repentant Israelites, after the termination of the dispensation of grace, to become constituents of the new race in God&rsquo;s new creation. Thus, God will complete the work of the new creation on the man of the old creation in the old creation, a work that will produce and perfect a new race. The peoples of the new race will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity. They are the object that God intends to obtain in His work both of the old creation and of the new creation throughout the generations for the fulfillment of His economy in eternity. Thus, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be mingled as one to be a mutual dwelling place for His ultimate corporate expression in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the conclusion of the dispensation of grace, God will change for the last time the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will set up His kingdom on the earth to carry out His administration that He may accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation. This is the dispensation of the kingdom, which is also called the dispensation of righteousness; it covers the period from the second coming of Christ to the end of the millennium. In this dispensation, according to His righteousness, He will use the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to reward the just men perfected in the Old Testament and the overcoming believers in Christ in the New Testament that they may participate in Christ&rsquo;s kingship and joy. Moreover, according to righteousness, He will perfect the immature believers in the New Testament and also will deal with all the Israelites who repent and believe in Christ at His coming back. The dispensation of the kingdom, which is the dispensation of righteousness, is still a dispensation in the old creation used by God to chasten, to discipline, and to perfect the believers. It is not in the new heaven and new earth that all the work of the new creation will be completed. God will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. That is, He will cause the immature believers in the dispensation of grace to mature in life, and He also will cause the repentant Israelites, after the termination of the dispensation of grace, to become constituents of the new race. In this way God will complete the work of the new creation on the man of the old creation in the old creation, a work that will produce and perfect a new race. Thus, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be mingled as one to be a mutual dwelling place for His ultimate corporate expression in eternity.</p>
