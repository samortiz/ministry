   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY HANDING ONESELF OVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Evening, April 23, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Chang Hsing-yung testified: During the past four years, I was persecuted by the Japanese, and both my arms and legs were injured.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although men rejected me, the Lord delivered me out of the rubble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, I went to Shanghai and Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In both places, I loved money more than I loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This time a brother informed me of this co-workers' conference, and I was able to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now I have received the light, and I am willing to consecrate myself afresh to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>MAMMON BEING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GREATEST HINDRANCE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Witness Lee: I deeply feel that the Lord is mainly after men, and not money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From Brother Chang's testimony, we can see that the greatest hindrance to serving God is mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not to say that mammon is the only hindrance, but we can say that mammon is the most serious hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It hinders us from serving the Lord with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, the hindrance within us is money, and the hindrance outside of us is also money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Money is the greatest hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HANDING OVER ONESELF</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Originally, during the co-workers' conference in the past few days there was no intention to speak on the matter of mammon; we were only speaking on the Body and on submission to authority in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To serve the Lord, we have to serve Him in the Body, and we have to hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not hand yourself over, there is no way for you to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this, we continued on with the line of handing over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In handing oneself over, not only must the work be handed over, but the money has to be handed over also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we touched the matter of handing over, we found out that this matter has a tail, and that tail is money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you satisfied with the way you serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not have to ask God about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We only need to ask ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord were to reckon with us today, could we give to Him a proper account?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our hearts condemn us, how much more will God condemn us also 1 John 3:20 ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have not yet been coordinated in the church, your heart will surely not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can be zealous and eloquent, but you will not be satisfied, because today is not the day for new teachings any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can love the Lord and have faith in Him, but today the way of individual service is a dead-end road.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I dare not say whether this was true one hundred or two hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God's need today is that we take the Body way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we feel dissatisfied within, it means that the Body has a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord requires that we serve Him today in the Body of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how many souls you have saved or how much work you have done, if you are not in the Body, you will not be satisfied with your service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words "handing over" are an apt and clear-cut expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you hold back yourself, you are giving yourself trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you hold back yourself, you can only drag your feet in the way of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot hold back anything in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do, we are offering to God burnt offerings with the dung attached.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the burnt offerings are offered up, the dung has to be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to have a clear dealing concerning everything related to us before we can consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
