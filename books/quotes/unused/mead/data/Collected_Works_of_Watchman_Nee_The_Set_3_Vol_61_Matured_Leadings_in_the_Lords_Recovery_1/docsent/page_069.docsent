   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 12 tells us that we should present our bodies a living sacrifice for the purpose of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This service bears three characteristics: First, it is holy, which means it is separated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have a friend who worked as a public officer during the war.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once I invited him to a meal, but he declined, saying, "Sorry, my body has been offered to the country; I cannot use it at will."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the meaning of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others cannot touch us or use us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am reserved for God's use only.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is being separated unto God, and this is being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, this service is well-pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, this service is also reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God holds back nothing when He gives Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should hold back nothing when we give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not settle accounts with us; He does not calculate how much He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He only cares for the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has not put up any resistance; He has not held back anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In giving ourselves to Him, we should not put up any resistance; we should not hold back anything from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our consecration cannot match His giving in quantity, but at least it should match His giving in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE MEANING OF BEING A LIVING SACRIFICE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The consecration in Romans 12 is the first reaction to God's work in the life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This reaction is the presenting of ourselves as a living sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament a sacrifice was an animal that was set apart to be killed and slain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that is placed on the altar is destined to die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once it dies, its life is over; it no longer has another use.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A sacrifice can be offered only once.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It cannot be used twice, because it died the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we are the sacrifices; therefore, we should die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank the Lord that we are also living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that we can constantly present ourselves to the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can offer up ourselves as sacrifices to the Lord continually, and the Lord can use us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first thing a Christian should be to the Lord is a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE RESULT OF PRESENTING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AS A LIVING SACRIFICE Spiritual Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we present ourselves to God as a living sacrifice, something follows in verse 2: We gain spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is important for a Christian to have a proper, spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many brothers and sisters are serving the Lord and the saints in the church, but they do not have any spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are very clear and savvy about worldly things, and they are very clever about secular business.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever they open their mouth in the church, however, only "outsiders' talk" comes out; they always say things that others cannot respond to with an "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because they have not been transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reason they are void of spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man cannot understand God's will when there is a problem with his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was in Shanghai, I often said to Miss Ruth Lee that many people think that the problem with their Christian service is with their mind, but I do not believe that any Christian has a problem with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people think they have a problem with their mind when they actually have a problem with their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their heart is muddled, and this affects their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Problems with the heart are caused by halfway consecrations that are fraught with reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man makes wrong judgments because his heart is pursuing treasure; his heart is influenced by money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason his eyes cannot see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once his consecration is absolute, his eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our eyes are only for God's glory and will, we will discern the inner makeup of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have other interests beside God, such as our treasure, our eyes will not be single, and we will not understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible treasure always relates to our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not Being Conformed to This Age</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 12:2 begins with the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second practical result of consecration is that we are not fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word fashioned means to be molded into a shape.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's intention is that we not be molded by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not have a worldly appearance, and we should not give others the impression that we are a "walking abacus."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as we are in the world, we have the shape of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is possible to take the way of worldly property brokers when we negotiate for meeting halls; it is possible that we give others an impression of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once we are consecrated, we should be free from any worldly appearance on the negative side, and we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that we have spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Presenting the body comes first, renewing of the mind follows, and finally one has the spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Originally we were very dull, but now we are sensitive, and it is easy to understand God's will.</S>
