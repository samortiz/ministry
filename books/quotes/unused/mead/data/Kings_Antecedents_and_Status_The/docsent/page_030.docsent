   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not ask Him to give you salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, you should say, "Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesus will never give you salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He will come to you as salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We believers do not realize how much we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every day, every hour, and even every moment we have something from which we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the messages on Genesis 1 we spoke about the need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But what does it mean to grow in life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the positive side, to grow in life is to enter into the riches of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the negative side, it is to be delivered from certain things, or to forsake certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we are small men, we have accumulated many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Probably you do not realize how many negative things you have accumulated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wherever we go, we collect things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We pick up a great many negative things, and we acquire a number of habits from which we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As you are reading this, you may not sense that you need salvation from anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose, however, you were suddenly raptured to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you were taken to the heavens right now, you would immediately sense that you need a great deal of saving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To grow in life is simply to be saved from all unnecessary things, from all that is not needed for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have the light, the exposure of the fourth-day lights, you will say, "Lord, save me!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At such times we realize that Jesus is truly Jehovah as our Savior and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Name of Jesus Being above Every Name</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name of Jesus is above every name Phil 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No name is as high and as exalted as the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>History tells us that during the past two thousand years, everyone has recognized that His name is the highest name, that it is an extraordinary name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My burden in this message is to point out to you that this exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>a. To Believe In</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all must believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we preach the gospel, we should help people not only to pray, but also to make a declaration to the whole universe that they believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever a sinner comes to believe in the Lord Jesus, he should declare, "Today I believe in the name of Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To Be Baptized Into</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into Acts 8:16; 19:5, "in" should be "into," Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>. Among some Christians there is a controversy regarding the name in which they baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some argue strongly that we must baptize people only in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others insist on the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two groups argue, debate, and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, it is not a matter of in the name, but of into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We baptize people into the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The name needs the person, and the name is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the person, the name means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose a certain young man has just believed in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should baptize him into the name of Jesus, that is, put him into Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a ritual nor a ceremony of accepting a religious member.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is an act of faith in which we take one who believes in the name of Jesus and put him into this name, baptizing him into the Person of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Romans 6:3 says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and Galatians 3:27 says, "Many of you have been baptized into Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. This is the reality of being baptized into the name of Jesus.</S>
