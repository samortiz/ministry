<p>Ephesians 4:16 begins with &ldquo;out from whom.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;out from&rdquo; in the original language carries the sense of &ldquo;originating from.&rdquo; When we grow into Christ in all things big or small, and when we become men in Christ enjoying Him, we will spontaneously have something originating from Him that is for the building up of His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Body Causes the Growth<br />
of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 16 goes on to say, &ldquo;All the Body...through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body.&rdquo; The growth of the Body of Christ is firstly through the joints of the rich supply. These are the gifts described in verse 11: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. They are the joints, which are joined together by the sinews, for the rich supply to every member of the Body of Christ. Second, this growth is according to the operation in measure of each one part. The each one part refers to every member in the Body. Every member in the Body of Christ, whether great or small, has a measure. Because of its measure, it has an operation. Through the rich supply of every joint and according to the operation in measure of each one part, the Body of Christ grows gradually.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Body Building Up Together</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;All the Body, fitted and knit together.&rdquo; To be fitted together is like the joining together of the frames and beams of a house. Hence, to be fitted together is for all the parts of the frames to be joined as one structure. To be knit together is like the filling up of the holes in between the frames by the rocks and the bricks, which are stacked up on top of one another and interwoven together. Hence, to be knit together is for all the other parts to be joined to the frames and to be knit together with one another to form one Body. In this way the whole Body is built together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body of Christ Building Itself Up</h2>
<p>The end of verse 16 says, &ldquo;The building up of itself [the Body] in love.&rdquo; The building up of the Body of Christ is in love and by love. This love is not our natural love. Rather, it is the divine love. We are building up the Body of Christ in the element and sphere of the divine love. At the same time, this is the direct building up of the whole Body of Christ by the many members of this Body. The Head does not build directly, nor do the gifted ones do the direct building work. Rather, it is we, the perfected members, who build up the Body of Christ directly.</p>
