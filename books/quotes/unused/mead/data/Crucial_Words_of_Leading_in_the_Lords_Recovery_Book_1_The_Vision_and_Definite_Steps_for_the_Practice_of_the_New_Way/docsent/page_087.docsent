   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST CRUCIAL ELEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUILDING UP THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Building up the home meetings in every believer s home is the first and foremost thing in our new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not a matter of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as a person is a believer, he is our brother in the Lord, even if he is the weakest, coldest, and most indifferent, backslidden person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we must make every effort to build up a meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I said from the beginning that the small group is the foundation for the building up of the church, and that such a small group must be built upon the foundation of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The scriptural basis for the small groups and the home meetings is the expression from house to house in Acts 2:46 and 5:42.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One and a half years ago I pointed out emphatically that on the day of Pentecost, as soon as the church was raised up on the earth, it began to meet from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was an unprecedented move; it was something that Judaism had never done before.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not an idea that Peter inherited from the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it was a brand new thing, a creative act of God, and something that He ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based on this, we were bold to say that we must have the small meetings, the group meetings, not only the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the group meetings brought in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, we were clear that we could not be satisfied with the so-called small group meetings alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to my observation, however, the brothers in Taiwan and the United States have misunderstood the meaning of the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not understand the small group to mean the home meetings, but merely a few brothers and sisters from the same area meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although these small group meetings were conducted in the homes, they were conducted in selected homes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was not my original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I realized that our change was merely outward; there was no change in the inward substance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our practice was still contrary to the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I felt that there was the need for more fundamental changes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was clear that the Lord wanted me to first build up a model in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, I told the brothers from the United States that I did not want them to hear anything or to spread anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be useless for them to copy Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They need to wait patiently until we arrive at some kind of result, and the success in Taiwan is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our practice in Taiwan is a model, and all the practices will come out of this model.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I returned to Taiwan, I emphatically told the brothers to divide up the small group meetings into home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, the term small group meeting is a temporary designation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible the only reference to the small groups is when the Lord divided the crowd into groups, in the story of the multiplication of loaves and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we divided up the church in Taiwan into groups and homes thirty years ago, we based our practice on the grouping which the Lord practiced in the multiplication of the loaves and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The pattern we saw in Acts, however, was that as soon as the church was raised up, the believers met not by groups but by houses ; the meetings were conducted in every believer s home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based on this, we decided that we could no longer focus our attention on the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we must focus our attention on the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to do our best to build up the home meeting in every believer s home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During this time we also learned some lessons on preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, during the past year and a half the brothers from America saw the practice of preaching to people one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not use the big meetings, nor the small meetings, nor meetings with two or three to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we should preach to people one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a very effective way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also began this practice in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past two and a half years we have brought in many people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a practice was compatible with our emphasis of meeting from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Based on such practices, the Lord showed us clearly that we need to bring the gospel to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should no longer pay that much attention to bringing people to the gospel meetings for them to listen to someone preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In spite of our strenuous efforts, we have experienced the futility of such work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>New ones come to such meetings thinking that they are doing us a great favor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of the meeting they usually fly away like birds in the air; with a goodbye they are gone, and there is no way to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now the situation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We no longer invite people to come and listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we deliver the gospel to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we deliver the gospel to their homes, we are spontaneously preaching one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If other family members are present in such a meeting, we have a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, not only do believers need such a meeting; a seeker of the gospel can also have such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no need to invite him to come to the meeting hall or to a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no need to even invite him to a saint s home.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can visit him, deliver the gospel to him, and meet with him in his own home.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a practice of delivering the Bible, the truth, the Lord Jesus, and salvation to a person s home is absolutely different from our practice of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who receive our message in such a way will truly have a different kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Formerly, they had to come to us; they were granting us a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now we are going to them; we are granting them a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They will surely be grateful to us for this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We did not have such a practice when we were in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time Shanghai was the largest city in China.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was an indifferent city.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>People could live in the same small street for more than ten years without speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No one was interested in anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we visited them, they would peep through their door hole and ignore us as they would a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The same was true in Hong Kong, where there was a lack of law and order; no one dared to open his door.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But this was not the case in Taiwan thirty years ago; people were cordial and warm.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Regrettably, at that time we did not see this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today there are many new urban communities in Taipei consisting of blocks and blocks of high-rise apartment buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every building houses at least eighty to a hundred units.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we visit these units, most of the occupants are very cordial and polite.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Of course, some turn away from us, but it is difficult to find one family that strongly opposes the gospel, the Bible, or the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As long as we can enter a person s home, we can meet in that home, and we can speak to people one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes we can find some dormant saints, and when we begin talking to them about the Lord, their cold hearts are rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Visiting people from house to house is truly the best way and the God-ordained practice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Recently the full-timers have been coordinating with the local saints to visit the communities twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Every time they come back, they report to us cases of baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This truly surprised the overseas brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They spend much time and effort to bring a person to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when we knock on people s doors, the doors are opened, and when we enter to talk to them and read with them a portion of The Mystery of Human Life, they pray, believe, receive the Lord, and are baptized in their own bathtubs.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Anyone who preaches the gospel to a person is qualified to baptize that person.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is something new.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All the overseas brothers find this place too attractive and do not want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They want to stay here to have a better taste of such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the four Gospels we find an excellent example of preaching the gospel to sinners the salvation of Zaccheus Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Zaccheus was not saved through a gospel campaign conducted by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord Jesus did not send Peter or John to invite him to come to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Rather, the Lord Jesus entered Jericho Himself and brought the gospel to Zaccheus s home.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Eventually, He said, Salvation has come to this house v. 9 . Salvation did not come to Zaccheus alone; it came to his house.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the proper and standard way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This year we have earnestly tried to practice this way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We no longer rely on the big gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Last October we had a big gospel meeting in the stadium.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Fourteen thousand people attended.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It was a great scene, but there was not much result; only a few people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The effect did not come close to what we have accomplished during the past six months by bringing people to the Lord one by one through visiting their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One point worth noting is that with our present practice we can immediately arrange for the next visit with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This means that we can arrange a time to have the next home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In this way, the home meeting is established.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The advantage is that we bring salvation not only to an individual but to a home, even to relatives and friends of that home.</S>
