   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah the priest, was born in Anathoth Jer 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was born as a priest and was called to be a prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Except for a few of the kings, leaders, priests, and people, everyone was against him and hated him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The false prophets, who assumed to speak in God s name, especially lied about and contradicted his prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, Azariah and Johanan and those who were close to Egypt forced him to go to Egypt Jer 43:2-7 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The Subject</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The subject is the salvation of Jehovah through Christ, the righteous Sprout, administered according to a new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. The Background</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kings and people of Israel had committed sins and were full of wickedness; they worshipped idols, rejected God s word, and were extremely unrestrained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jeremiah prophesied that they needed to repent and turn back to Jehovah; otherwise, they would be carried into captivity and their nation would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. The Central Thought</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The judgment of Jehovah on sin is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His love and faithfulness are also definite and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ones who went astray should repent and come back to His bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>E. The General Sketch</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jehovah rebuked the kings and the people for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had forsaken God and disobeyed His word 2:13; 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were worshipping idols and committing fornication 1:16; 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They also spoke lies, deceiving others, and committed iniquity 9:3, 5; 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kings scattered God s people and did not care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jeremiah, on one hand, rebuked the kings and the people for their sins and wanted them to repent; on the other hand, he warned them that they would be taken into captivity, that their nation would be destroyed, and that the cities of Judah and Jerusalem would become desolate.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LAMENTATIONS A. The Writer s , the Place, and the Time</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The writer of Lamentations is also Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This book was once part of the book of Jeremiah, and at one time it was called the Second Book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Jewish tradition and the translators of the Septuagint, this book was written by the prophet after Nebuchadnezzar s final destruction of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This would mean that it was written about 588 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This book was most probably written in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outside the city, facing Golgotha also called Calvary , there is a hidden cave which is called the cave of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is said that the prophet used to sit there to mourn for that desolate city, and that it is there that he wrote the lamentations recorded in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. The Subject</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The subject is repentance from the sin that brought in the righteous judgment of God results in His merciful salvation and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>C. The Background</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jerusalem fell and the people were taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the warnings of Jeremiah were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But because he loved God and God s people, Jeremiah could not bear to see the fall of Israel and the loss of God s glory due to the degradation of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus Jeremiah wrote Lamentations and wept for them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>D. The Central Thought</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The central thought is the suffering and calamities brought on by sin, and the mercy and lovingkindness which Jehovah still has toward His children even when He is angry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>E. The General Sketch</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lamentations, composed of five chapters which are five songs, may be divided into five sections: suffering, lamenting, hope, confessing, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Except for the fifth, each song speaks first of the tragic destruction of Jerusalem and then of the righteousness of God s severe judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations 1:1 .</S>
