<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS—THEIR DESIGNATIONS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>We have seen that in the New Testament the believers in Christ are designated disciples and believers. In this message we shall cover the two remaining designations of the believers in the New Testament—saints and Christians.<h2 class=head1>C. SAINTS</h2><p>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the believers as saints. Acts 9:13 and 32 refer respectively to the saints in Jerusalem and to “the saints dwelling at Lydda.” Romans 1:7 says, “To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints.” Romans 8:27 tells us that the Spirit “intercedes for the saints.” Romans 12:13 speaks of “communicating to the needs of the saints,” and 15:25, of the ministry to the saints. The word “saints” denotes those who are holy, separated unto God. We are not only believers in Christ—we are saints of God. We are God’s holy people, a people separated unto God for His purpose.<h2 class=head2>1. Those Who Have Been Separated and Made Holy unto God</h2><p>The term “saints” denotes those who have been separated and made holy unto God. Saints are separated ones, those who have been set apart to God. First Corinthians 1:2 says, “To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints.” The expression “called saints” indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition.<p>According to grammar, in 1 Corinthians 1:2 “to the church of God” is in apposition to “to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.” This indicates that “to the church of God” equals “to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.” This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints and that the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church.<p>Furthermore, in 1:2 “called saints” is in apposition to “those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.” Instead of saying “called saints,” the King James Version says, “called to be saints.” According to this translation, being a saint is pending; it is not already an accomplished fact. But Paul did not say that we are called to be saints; he says that we are called saints. If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, in whom we have been sanctified, we shall be able to declare that we are saints. We shall realize that a saint is simply a called one.<p>To be called by God is to be separated unto Him. For example, those who have been called into military service have been separated from civilian life and drafted into the service. This illustrates God’s calling. When we were called by God we were separated by Him. As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. Because we have been called by God unto His purpose, we are the called saints.
