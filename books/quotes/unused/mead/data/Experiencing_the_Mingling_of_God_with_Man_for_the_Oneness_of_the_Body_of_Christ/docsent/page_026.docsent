   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE CASES OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the five cases of the baptism in the Holy Spirit in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first case occurred on the day of Pentecost when the one hundred and twenty disciples were baptized in the Holy Spirit 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the fulfillment of the Lord s promise to His disciples in Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second case involved the believers in Samaria 8:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were a number of people in Samaria who had believed in the Lord Jesus, had been baptized into His name, and had received the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12, 16b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, these believers did not have the Holy Spirit upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Peter and John, two of the apostles, came down from Jerusalem to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These apostles prayed that the Samaritan believers would be baptized in the Spirit v. 15 , and when they laid their hands on the Samaritans, the Holy Spirit came upon them v. 17 . Before their baptism in the Spirit, the Samaritans had the Holy Spirit within, because they had believed in the Lord Jesus, but they did not have the Spirit upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third case seen in Acts was the case involving Saul, who was saved on the way to Damascus 9:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time he received the Lord as his Savior, the Spirit entered into him, and he was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that Saul prayed to the Lord v. 11 is an indication that he had been regenerated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, it was not until a disciple by the name of Ananias came to him, prayed for him, and laid hands on him that Paul was outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fourth case of the baptism in the Holy Spirit in Acts occurred in the house of Cornelius 10:44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Peter spoke to those in Cornelius s house, the Holy Spirit came down upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though no one prayed for them or laid hands on them, they were baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fifth case involved the believers in Ephesus, who were genuine believers but had only been baptized into John s baptism 19:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As believers, they had the Holy Spirit within them, but they did not have the Holy Spirit upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, when the apostle Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they were baptized in the Holy Spirit and clothed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the first case there was no laying on of hands, because the Lord Jesus Himself baptized the disciples in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same thing happened in the fourth case in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those in Cornelius s house were baptized in the Holy Spirit directly by Christ as the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was no need for an intermediary to lay hands upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of the five cases in Acts, only these two cases are referred to as the baptism in the Holy Spirit 1:5; 11:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The other three cases seen in Acts are not called the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason for this is that the baptism in the Spirit, like the Lord s crucifixion, is an eternal fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as all those who believe in the Lord Jesus have already been crucified on the cross Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 , so also all those who believe in the Lord Jesus have already been baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit was fully accomplished on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, and once it had been accomplished, it was accomplished forever and for every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit that occurred in Jerusalem was for the Jewish part of the Body of Christ, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit involving those in Cornelius s house was for the Gentile part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in these two cases both the Jewish and the Gentile believers are represented.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through these two events the Lord as the Head of the Body baptized the entire Body into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why 1 Corinthians 12:13 uses the past tense in saying that we were all baptized in one spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit was the baptism into the Body and was for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>EXPERIENCING THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BY REALIZING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is for the Body and not for individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The eternal fact is that the Lord as the Head of the Body did not baptize individual believers in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, He baptized His entire Body in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we examine the other three cases in Acts the cases regarding the Samaritan believers, Saul, and the Ephesian disciples we will see that in each case there was the need of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the Body had already been baptized in the Holy Spirit, those who had been saved and had become members of the Body needed to realize the oneness of the Body in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They needed a representative of the Body to put his hands on them to signify that they had been received into the Body and had truly realized the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When that representative laid his hands on them, the Head of the Body honored that by immersing them in the Holy Spirit, who was upon the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, if we want to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we must realize the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we remain individualistic and independent of the Body, it will be nearly impossible to experience the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we stand as those who have been joined to the Body of Christ, we will experience being clothed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Matthew 3:16 the Holy Spirit came down like a dove upon Christ, and this Christ is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius the Spirit who had come down upon the Head also came down upon the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now, whenever a person is saved, he needs to realize the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he sees the oneness of the Body and takes the oneness of the Body as his stand, he will experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, because the anointing that is already on the Body will come upon him Psa 133:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, in order to have the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we must realize the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must tell the Lord, Lord, I am standing on the ground of the oneness of the Body, and on this ground I claim the anointing that is on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are truly on the ground of the oneness of the Body, we should simply claim the anointing that is already on the Body and take it by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may tell the Lord, Lord, I have the baptism in the Holy Spirit because I am in the Body, and the Spirit is on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is on the Body must also be my share, my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A TESTIMONY OF THE LORD S EXALTATION</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must also realize that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a testimony of the Lord s exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the Lord Jesus ascended, He was exalted to the highest position in the universe and seated at the right hand of God Acts 2:33a .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was made both Lord and Christ, as well as the Head of the church v. 36; Eph 1:20-22 . People on the earth can know this by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the day of Pentecost Peter told the people that the outpouring of the Spirit that they had witnessed was a testimony that Christ had been exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was a testimony that Christ had ascended to the heavens, had received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and had poured Himself out as the Spirit upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, whenever we are outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit, we will spontaneously say, Jesus is Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>1 Cor 12:3b because at that moment we will realize that this Jesus, who was put to death on the cross, has been exalted to the heavens, has been enthroned as Lord of all, and has been made the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After His resurrection the Lord came to His disciples and breathed into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 , and after His ascension He poured out the Holy Spirit upon His disciples like a strong wind to empower them that they might be a strong testimony to the world for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In His resurrection Christ dispensed Himself into us as the Spirit of life, and in His ascension He poured Himself out upon us as the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we simply stand on the ground of the oneness of the Body, look to the ascended Christ, and claim what He has already poured out upon the Body by faith, we will experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After we experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we will realize that as members of the Body, it is our portion to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many things, which only the Lord knows, will happen when we begin to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the Lord be gracious to us that we may seek the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that we may be filled inwardly and clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then we will be normal Christians in life and service, those who are fully mingled with the Triune God and who enjoy all that God is to us and has for us.</S>
