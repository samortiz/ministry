<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE AGE OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1a, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 14:13b; 22:17a; 5:6; 1:10; 19:10b; 22:6b</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO QUOTATIONS</H2><P>The age of the Book of Revelation is the age of the seven Spirits, and this is the day in which we are living. Hallelujah for the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation! It is entirely different from all the other books. In Matthew there are a number of quotations from the Old Testament. In John, the Acts, Romans, Hebrews, and other books there are also many quotations. But here in the Book of Revelation, a book of twenty-two chapters, we cannot find one Old Testament quotation. It is absolutely a new book; nothing in it is quoted from the old books. In this book there are no quotations from the entire Bible&#151;nothing at all of the old way. Then what is here? The seven Spirits! There is a Lamb with seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God. This is all. We only see the Lamb, the Redeemer, with the intensified Spirit. Nothing is of the old source. All the utterances in this book are made by the sevenfold Spirit and are new and fresh. There is nothing religious, nothing old, nothing dead; everything is spoken by the living Spirit in a new and living way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO HUMAN SPEAKING</H2><P>Furthermore, we never read in this book of any human utterances! We always read that it is the Spirit who is speaking. "Yea, saith the Spirit" (14:13). "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches" (2:7, etc.). Seven times in chapters 2 and 3 we read that it is the Spirit who is speaking to the churches. The messages here are quite unlike those of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied, "Yea, my people, thus saith the Lord.." The utterances here are also unlike those in the Epistles. The Epistles say, "This I [Paul] say" (I Cor. 7:6), or "I [Peter] exhort" (I Pet. 5:1), etc. Here in the Book of Revelation it never says, "Thus saith the Lord," or "This I say," etc. It says rather, "The Spirit saith, the Spirit saith, the Spirit saith." Have you noticed this same sentence with the same wording repeated seven times: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches"? Why is this sentence repeated seven times? Because of the seven-fold Spirit. Eventually the entire book is concluded in this way: "And the Spirit and the bride say.." (22:17). We read firstly in this book that the Spirit is speaking to the churches. Then eventually the Spirit and the Bride become one&#151;they speak together. The Spirit and the church in this verse are a compound subject. The two have been compounded; the two have become one. Hallelujah! The church is one with the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits have been fully wrought into the church. This is God's goal! This is the ultimate consummation of His eternal purpose.</P>
