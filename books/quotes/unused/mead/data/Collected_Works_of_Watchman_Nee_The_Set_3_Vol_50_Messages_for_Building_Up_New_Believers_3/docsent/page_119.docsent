   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Becoming the Privilege of a Household</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From that day forward, the kingdom of priests became a tribe of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The scope of the priesthood was reduced from a kingdom of priests to a household of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The priesthood became the matter of a household instead of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's people and God's priests were one and the same in the tribe of Levi; that is, His people were His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In regards to the other eleven tribes, God's people were only God's people; they could no longer be God's priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was most serious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is serious for a person to be a believer, one of God's people, and yet not be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BEING A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From Exodus until the time of the Lord Jesus on earth, no other tribe could function as priests except the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They could not offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their sacrifices had to be made through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They could not even come to God to confess their sins; they had to confess them through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They could not separate themselves from the world because they had no authority to touch the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The priests alone could anoint and sanctify a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the spiritual services had to be carried out by the priests on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One special characteristic about the Israelites in the Old Testament was that God was far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not everyone could contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament we find the evolution of the priesthood, which I call an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man could not go to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's people had to go through the priests before they could draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They could not commune with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God came to man through the priests, and man also went to God through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Between God and man, there was a mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man could not come directly to God, and God could not come directly to man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Between God and man there was a mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This class was not found in God's original design.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's original intention was to approach His people directly and for them to come to Him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now there were three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The people had to come to God through the priests, and God had to approach His people through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God and man could no longer commune with each other directly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All contact became indirect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CHANGE IN THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For about fifteen hundred years, from the time of Moses to the time of Christ, God's people were unable to come directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only one household was qualified to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man had to belong to this household to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he drew near to God directly, he would die.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During that period, the ministry of the priests became a very powerful ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man could not come to God directly; he needed the intercession of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How noble and great the priestly ministry was!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was no way for man to come to God without the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But with the coming of the New Testament age, we find salvation and redemption reaching all men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we hear the word: "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A. Every Redeemed One Being a Priest</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>in the New Testament Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1 Peter 2:4-7 Peter tells us that Christ is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was the stone rejected by the builders who has now become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have become the living stones and are joined and built up to become a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also have become a holy priesthood to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is as if a voice from heaven burst forth announcing, "All who are saved are now God's priests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the living stones, those who are part of the spiritual house, are now priests of God."</S>
