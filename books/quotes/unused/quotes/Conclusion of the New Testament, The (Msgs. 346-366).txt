In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Philippians
Through Christ we should be fruitful in the matter of righteousness; we should not be wrong with God or man in anything
The bountiful supply comes out of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; hence, Christ as the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Supplier
The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit enabled Paul to live and magnify Christ in his sufferings for Him
In his suffering, the apostle experienced both the Lord's suffering in His humanity and the Lord's resurrection
The Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
We must go on to experience the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is the processed Triune God as everything to us
By such a Spirit, Paul suffered for God's economy and simultaneously enjoyed a bountiful supply that strengthened him in resurrection
May we also experience and enjoy the Triune God supplying us and working Himself into us as the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances
We should not care for holiness spirituality or victory as things in themselves and we should not care for our natural virtues or attributes
We should focus our whole attention on living Christ and care only to live Christ so that He might be magnified in us
We, the God-men, live a human life to express God, not by our own life, our natural life, but by the divine life of Christ in resurrection
Abiding in Christ and having Him abide in us for His life to grow in fruit-bearing are also a part of living Christ
To live Christ includes growing into Christ in everything that we may mature in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
For us to live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us, and we are not put to shame in anything
In the apostle's suffering in his body, Christ was magnified; that is, Christ was shown or declared to be great , exalted, and extolled
If we allow the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to work in us, our daily living will be changed
The central thought of the Bible is that God desires us to live Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
To live Christ should be our primary goal; all the troubles in our Christian life come because of our not living Christ
We need to practice to live Christ, realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, until we live Christ habitually
Our mind should be concentrated on Christ, but the concentration of our mind on Christ depends upon our love for Christ
If we do not love Christ, we cannot live Him; loving Him is the best way to concentrate our entire being on Him
When a young mother delivers a child, her whole living is that new baby; for her, to live is her new baby because of her love for her child
In summary, we need to live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Verses 5 through 16 reveal that the word of life works out the pattern by the operating God in order to apply salvation to our daily living
To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to this extent, that is, in His tender, inward feeling and in His thinking
Philippians 2:6 says, 'Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped'
The Greek word rendered 'existing' denotes existing from the beginning, implying the Lord's eternal preexistence
Verse 7 goes on to say that Christ 'emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ's deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity
Verse 8 continues And being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself becoming obedient even unto death and that the death of a cross
When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men
Christ emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and by becoming in the likeness of men
Being found in fashion as a man, in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death
After becoming a man and being found in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself even unto the death of the cross
If we did not have the crucified life within us, we could never live according to the pattern presented in Philippians 2
If we still do things out of rivalry and vainglory or are still ambitious to be leaders, we are not living a crucified life
Both the experience of Christ as the pattern of a crucified life and the experience of the resurrection power that exalts Him are endless
In the church life we either take the crucified life as our pattern or automatically live a life of rivalry and vainglory
If we do not take the crucified life as our pattern, we will automatically live in the way of rivalry and vainglory
The highest life on earth is the crucified life, that is, Christ Himself as the One who emptied Himself and humbled Himself
Whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into the power of resurrection, and in this power we will be exalted
We must stand firm for the Lord's testimony, yet we should not claim any standing, title, or position for ourselves
Of seeking glory for ourselves, we should seek Christ and Him alone; then we will experience the crucified life
We need to be enlightened and take this crucified life as our pattern so that we may experience the power of resurrection
Salvation here is not salvation from the lake of fire rather it refers to what Paul has already said about salvation earlier in this Epistle
In order for this to be accomplished in our experience, the pattern must be subjective to us as well as objective
The fact that salvation is a living person and that this person is our pattern indicates that the pattern is subjective as well as objective
Paul's word about God operating in us is a further indication that the pattern is subjective as well as objective
We have within us a life that never insists on being anything but always empties itself, takes a lower place, and humbles itself
He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men
Of seeking a position and title for ourselves, we need to live according to Christ as the pattern of a crucified life
Our goal is the all-inclusive Christ as the prize awarded to us; when we reach the goal, the goal will immediately become the prize
Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone
All the things that were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him
Like Paul, we should not boast in our religious status; rather, we should count it as loss on account of Christ
In verse 8 Paul goes on to say, 'I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord'
The 'all things' in verse 8 must certainly include the three categories of religious things, philosophical things, and cultural things
Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture
To some extent at least, we still have within us certain things that are substitutes for Christ in subtle, secret ways
The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in human history; hence, they are zealous for the law
On account of this, he counted as loss not only the law and the religion founded according to the law but all things
The addition of the words my Lord indicates that as Paul was writing, he was filled with intimate, tender feelings concerning Christ
Tender feelings concerning the preciousness of the Lord Jesus rose up within him, causing him to speak of 'Christ Jesus my Lord'
The phrase as to, which may be rendered 'according to,' is used three times in verses 5 and 6, with the law, zeal, and righteousness
The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is mentioned in verse 8, whereas the actual experience of Christ is implied in verse 10
At his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became 'a man in Christ'
The righteousness of the law is the righteousness which comes from man's own effort to keep the law, as mentioned in verse 6
Spontaneously, Paul lived God out as his daily living and could be found in Christ, having the righteousness of God
When we experientially have the supply of the Spirit through the word of life issuing in the faith of Christ we are infused with God Himself
The God who has been infused into us becomes our daily living, the living which Paul describes as the righteousness of God
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
To know Him in verse 10 is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him
Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way
We need to know Christ by enjoying Him, experiencing Him, being one with Him, and having Him live within us and walk with us
Our conformity to His death affords the power of His resurrection a base from which to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us
Although it is wonderful to enjoy the power of Christ's resurrection, the power of resurrection is not mainly for our enjoyment
Christ as the Lamb of God suffered for redemption ; Christ as the grain of wheat suffered for reproducing and building
As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection
Through such a life of being molded to Christ's death, Paul experienced and enjoyed the resurrection power of Christ
The mold of Christs death refers to Christs experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God
Christ's death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put into a cake mold and conformed to it
In the mold of Christ's death, the natural life is killed, the old man is crucified, and the self is nullified
If we allow our circumstances to press us into this mold, our daily life will be molded into the form of Christ's death
By being conformed to His death, we experience Christ in His death for the release, impartation, and multiplication of life
The out-resurrection refers to the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints
To arrive at the out-resurrection indicates that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected
There is only one kind of resurrection that brings us out of the old creation and into God, and this is the resurrection of Christ
Not to forget but to linger in our past experiences, however genuine they were, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ
Even though Paul was a matured saint and an experienced apostle, he tells us that he had not already obtained and had not yet been perfected
In order to have this portion of resurrection, we must pursue, run the race, and finish our course triumphantly
After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent that we may even say he persecuted Christ but in a very positive way
After he was saved and had been gained by Christ, Paul still persecuted Him, but positively, for he refused to let Christ go
If we do not have a fixed goal, the unique goal, the goal set up by God in eternity, and hold to it, we will eventually be distracted
The only thing that can keep us on God's way is His unique goal-Christ for our highest enjoyment and ultimate gain
Pauls main thought in Philippians 316 is that as Christians the most important principle of our Christian life should be to pursue Christ
The governing principle of our Christian life should be the pursuing after the enjoyment and experience of Christ
Thinking the same thing and doing all things without murmurings and especially reasonings are matters in our mind
In chapter 3, as we will see in this message, to experience Christ in the final state is to experience Him in our body
In verse 20 Paul says, 'Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ'
As we await and love the Lord's glorious appearing from the heavens, we should live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life
Christ's body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
Though our body may be enlivened by the Spirit who indwells us , it is a mortal body, subject to death and needing to be redeemed
No matter how much our body may be enlivened and saturated by the Spirit, it still requires the Lord's full redemption
Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life
Our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God
At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory , and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints
We are on the way of being brought into glory by the sanctifying work of the Spirit; sanctification is the gradual process of glorification
The believers' entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God to enjoy God Himself
The subjective glory of God in us, the expression of God in us, is a glory that progresses from one degree to another
The believers' arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God and the climax of God's salvation in life
We were regenerated in our spirit; now we are being transformed in our soul; eventually we will be transfigured in our body
The expression in the same way stand means to stand in a particular way, in the way presented in the foregoing chapters
Since everything depends on His will and since we are one with Him in a practical way, there is no reason for us to be anxious
If we would make our forbearance known to all men and not be anxious in anything, we need to practice being one with the Lord
In our prayer to God there must be the essence of worship and fellowship, and there must also be petitions for particular needs
Even if we do not have specific needs, we still need a time of prayer day by day to worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him
As we worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him in prayer, we enjoy communion with Him and practice the organic union with Him
The issue, the result, of practicing the organic union with the Lord is that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus
From experience we know that through prayer we receive this antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us
The metaphor here refers to a person's being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles
The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life to live Christ to pursue Christ to gain Christ to magnify Christ and to express Christ
He knew what it was to have worry and anxiety in times of suffering, but at those times he applied the secret of the indwelling Christ
It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5: 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
The 'all things' in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and to the virtues listed in verse 8
On the other hand, by the empowering of Christ, we can be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
The fact that man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
In order to live Christ as our human virtues for the expression of the divine attributes, we need to be empowered by the indwelling Christ
Empowered by the indwelling Christ, we will be able to do all the things spoken of in Philippians 4:8 through 12
We see that whenever we receive a gift, we need to have the assurance that this gift is presented not only to us but also to God
Paul told the Philippians that God would fill every need of theirs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus
When we enjoy Christ to this extent, although there may be many problems in our circumstances, in Christ and with God they will be solved
In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Colossians
In Colossians 112 Paul says Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light
When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians and was speaking of the portion of the saints, he had in mind the type of the good land
We, the believers in Christ, have received a portion of Christ as the good land, which Paul calls the portion of the saints
Gods will for us is that we know Christ experience Christ enjoy Christ be saturated with Christ and have Christ become our life and person
The will of God is profound in relation to our knowing, experiencing, and living the all-inclusive, extensive Christ
The New Testament believers inheritance their allotted portion is not a physical land it is the allinclusive Christ as the lifegiving Spirit
By enjoying the riches of the land, the believers in Christ are built up to be His Body as the house of God and the kingdom of God
Verse 13 reminds us of the way the children of Israel were delivered out of Egypt and transferred into the good land
Paul's concept in verse 13 is the same as that revealed in the exodus from Egypt and in the entering into the good land
To be qualified for a share of the portion of the saints is actually to enter into the reality of the good land
Verse 13 is the explanation and definition of how the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints
Our being delivered from the authority of darkness was the first step to be qualified to have a share in Christ
The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection
It is easier to give an illustration of the kingdom of the Son of His love than it is to give an adequate definition of it
Because of the pleasantness of the Lords rule in us we do not care even to speak a vain word or to have a thought that is displeasing to Him
When we were holding to our philosophy, ethics, asceticism, and ordinances, we were under the authority of darkness
God has delivered us out of this authority and has transferred us into a kingdom of love that is full of life and light
Our Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love
To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us
When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father's love
Under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light
In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being
The authority of darkness includes our virtues, religion, philosophy, observances, ordinances, principles, and ethical standards
We do not sense that we are under righteousness, power, or authority but under the loving and lovable Lord Jesus
Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight
The emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of the Son of God's love in this age, which is the reality of the church
The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of God's love, which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is
There is the need for us to pray concerning knowing the will of God and walking worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things
As the portion of the saints, Christ is not only the Son of God's love but also the image, the expression, of the invisible God
God is invisible but the Son of His love the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance is His image expressing what He is
The image in Colossians 1:15 does not mean a physical form but an expression of God's being in all His attributes and virtues
The Christ who is our good land, the allotted portion of the saints, is also the image of the Triune God, His expression
Verse 15 reveals that Christ is not only the Creator but also the first among all created things, the first among all creatures
Otherwise, He could not have been arrested, tried, and crucified, and He could not have shed His blood on the cross for our sins
As God, Christ is eternal and did not need to be born, but in verse 15 He is called the Firstborn of all creation
If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending
The difference between God's estimate of time and ours also helps us to understand why Christ is called the second man
From our point of view, the second man was Cain, the son of the first Adam, but from God's point of view, the second man is Christ
Because Christ is the first among the creatures, we can say that as the all-inclusive One He is both the Creator and part of creation
Through Him indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished in sequence
God is invisible, but if we look at God's creation, we will see that creation is the expression of the invisible God
All Christians realize that Christ was born through incarnation, but not many regard His resurrection also as a birth
Through the two births of Christ, divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity
In this two-way traffic God came into man through incarnation, and man was brought into God through resurrection
Colossians 1:15-17 unveils Christ as the first in the original creation, as the One who has the preeminence among all creatures
The new creation, on the contrary, came into being through resurrection, through the death and resurrection of the old creation
If the old creation is in Christ, through Christ, unto Christ and subsists together in Christ, so the new creation is all the more
In the church we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist in Christ to be God's expression in Christ
In both the old creation and the new creation Christ is the first and occupies the first place, the place of preeminence
Since Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church
According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence
The universe is the environment in which the church, the new creation, exists as the Body of Christ to express Christ in full
For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both extensive and all-inclusive
If Christ is infused into us, we will drop everything that is not Christ, and we will be constituted with Christ in our being
For the fullness to dwell in Christ means that all the expression of God, all of His image, was pleased to dwell in Him
God is expressed in Him because all things have come into being in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and they subsist in Him
Through His subjective relationship to creation, Christ is the fullness of the unseen God, the image of the invisible God
When we consider the universe and the church, the old creation and the new creation, we see all the fullness of the Triune God
The expression through Him means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was accomplished
Both the things in the heavens and things on the earth needed to be reconciled to God because of Satan's rebellion and man's fall
God then restored the polluted universe, created man, and gave man dominion over the universe, making man the head of the creation
As the mystery of God, Christ is the Word of God ; Christ is the definition, explanation, and expression of God
God's history refers to the process through which He passed so that He may come into man and that man may be brought into Him
According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe
In order to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit
We should tell the Lord, 'I care only for You as the embodiment of God and as the life-giving Spirit in my spirit
As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ
Since wisdom and knowledge are stored up in Christ as a treasure, we cannot have wisdom and knowledge unless we have Christ
If we exercise our being to contact the Lord, Christ as the life-giving Spirit will saturate our spirit and our mind
We should not be like the Colossians, who allowed pagan philosophy to defraud them of the wisdom and knowledge hidden in Christ
In 2:6-7 Paul says, 'As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him'
To 'walk in Him' means to live, to behave, to speak, and to have our being in the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ
Christ is not only the soil in which we have been rooted but also the foundation on which we are being built up
If we fail to apply Him, then practically in our daily living there is little significance to having received Him
Christ is not only the sphere, the realm, in which we walk, but He is also every factor and element of our human life
After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience
In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, 'The Lord be with your spirit,' and in 1 Corinthians 6:17, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
After charging us to walk in Christ, Paul in verse 7 immediately adds the words, 'having been rooted and being built up in Him'
If we would walk in Christ, we must fulfill the conditions of having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him
Our basis for walking in Christ is that we have already been rooted in Christ and that we are in the process of being built up in Him
In Matthew 15:13 the Lord Jesus said, 'Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up'
In this fellowship those factors in the plant and in the soil which correspond to each other become one in life
In our spirit we have the experience of being planted into Christ, for here we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him
If we had only a body and a soul but no spirit, it would not be possible for us to be planted into the Lord as the life-giving Spirit
In this way we experience Christ as the good land with the rich soil that affords us the nourishing life element
As a tree absorbs nourishing elements from the soil through its roots, we also should absorb the riches of Christ into us
The only way to become deeply rooted in Christ as the soil is to contact Him and daily absorb the water in the Word
After we have grown downward for a period of time, we will automatically cease to walk in things other than Christ
We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the body
If our roots are tender and new to absorb the riches of Christ, we will grow automatically with the riches that we assimilate
We need to forget our situation, our condition, failures, and weaknesses and simply take time to absorb the Lord
Paul first tells us that we have been rooted in Christ; then he goes on to say that we are being built up in Christ
We are plants, and Christ is the soil to us; we also are the building, and Christ is the material with which we are built
We need to grow to a greater measure of Christ, and the way to grow is by feeding on Christ, taking Him in, and digesting Him
In order to be built up corporately, the Colossians had to forsake the Judaistic observances and the heathen ordinances and philosophies
Whenever we take in some kind of philosophy, ordinance, observance, or practice in place of Christ, the church life is annulled
If we would walk in Christ, we need to absorb His riches by being rooted in Him and built up as individual members of the Body
When we are adequately rooted in Christ and are personally built up in Christ, we will become the expression of Christ
The word dwells indicates that the fullness of the Godhead must be a person; the fullness of the Godhead is personified
The fullness of the Godhead dwells as a person in the incarnated Christ bodily, that is, in Christ with a human body
The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical
Now that the fullness of the Godhead dwells as a divine person in Christ bodily, it is visible, touchable, and receivable
The Colossians were under the influence of Gnosticism, which regards man's physical body and the entire material world as evil
In refuting the Gnostic philosophy, the apostle Paul told the Colossians that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily
The Godhead in verse 9 refers to deity, which is different from the divine characteristics manifested by the created things
When we receive, experience, and enjoy Christ, we receive, experience, and enjoy the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In Colossians 2:10 Paul continues, 'You have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority'
The Greek word translated have been made full is a verbal adjective based on the same root as the word translated fullness a noun in verse 9
Because all the fullness dwells in Him, after we have been put into Christ , we are made full, filled up, with all the divine riches
Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him, we have been made full in Him
The result is that all that He is and all that He has belongs to us, and all that He has experienced is our history
All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance
Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate
We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor
Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her
We need to exercise our faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today
In Christ as the soil we are filled, completed, perfected, satisfied, and thoroughly supplied; we do not lack anything
Now that we have been rooted in the good land, the fullness has become ours, and we are supplied with every positive thing
In this all-inclusive and extensive fullness, we have everything: God, an uplifted humanity, divine attributes, and human virtues
All the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil
Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels
The fact that we have been made full in Christ who is the Head of all rule and authority is versus the worship of angels
Paul thus declares that in Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the saints have been circumcised
It is also the circumcision of Christ, that is, to be crucified with Him, buried together with Him in baptism, and raised together with Him
In addition to that physical circumcision, there is another kind of circumcision, the circumcision in Christ, which is not made with hands
Regarding the positive things, we are not short of anything, and regarding the negative things, we are no longer troubled by anything
According to our apparent situation, we are short of everything positive and are troubled by everything negative
Because we are in Him, we have been made full positively, and we have been circumcised to clear away the negative things
The spiritual circumcision in verse 11 must be in the circumcision of Christ, not with a circumcision made with hands
In baptism there is the burial aspect, which is the termination of our flesh, and the raising aspect, which is the germination of our spirit
By faith we have the reality of the termination and burial of the old man, the self, the flesh, and the natural life
Paul is asking the believers why they still subjected themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society
These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible
According to the teaching and practice of asceticism, treating the body severely eliminates lusts and restricts indulgence
We not only have Christ, the unique person, who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all other ways
Speaking of spiritual experience, we also must pass through many crosses before we can reach the New Jerusalem
What we need to do is simply lie down through the cross at night, have a restful sleep, and then rise up in the morning in resurrection
By passing through all manner of crosses, large and small, we will have oneness and harmony in the church life
We should pass through all the crosses that we encounter in the Christian life, in the family life, and in the church life
If we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be harmony both in the family life and in the church life
Eating and drinking signify daily satisfaction and strengthening , and the Sabbath signifies weekly completion and rest
Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today
All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come
The Old Testament uses six major categories of things as types to describe Christ human beings animals plants minerals offerings and foods
Christ is typified by foods, such as bread, wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, milk, and honey
We who believe in Christ should consider all things and evaluate all things according to Christ, who is everything to us in a practical way
According to the principle in the Bible, the first in a certain category often includes all the other items in that category
When the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation
Even the satisfaction that we enjoy after a good meal is not the real satisfaction but a shadow of Christ as the reality of satisfaction
As we put on our clothing, we should be reminded that Christ is the real clothing, and we should experience Him as such
Everything that we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything
If Christ is truly everything to us in our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life, there will be no need for us to express our opinion
We should not allow anyone to defraud us of this prize, and we need to enjoy Christ in all the small details of our daily living
God's economy is to head up all things in Christ through His Body, the church, thereby making Christ the center of all things
To be preserved in Christ for the church life is to hold Him as the Head, out from whom the Body grows with the growth of God
As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God as the source of life
Joints are for the supply of the Body, whereas sinews are for the knitting together of the members of the Body
Based upon this fact, Paul warns us not to allow anyone to purposely defraud us of our prize, the subjective enjoyment of Christ
Those who seek to defraud us are the ones who stand on things which they have seen and who do not hold the Head
If we would know what it means to hold the Head, we must know what it is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things
As we enjoy Christ as our food, drink, air, and everything, we are uplifted to the height of our experience of holding Christ as the Head
If in our experience we temporarily abandon Christ and do not continue holding Him as the Head, we will sense that we are earthly
We can be experientially in the heavens only by enjoying Christ, the Head, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
If Christ were only the Head and not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to contact Him or hold Him experientially
Anyone who is puffed up by the mind of the flesh does not hold Christ as the Head, for he is in his fleshly mind, not in the spirit
The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body
If we fail to contact the Lord for a period of time, we will automatically neglect the church life or lose interest in the meetings
Instead of criticizing the church, we will praise the Lord for the church life, and we will testify how much we love it
Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious
If the supply of Christ is ministered to us and we begin to enjoy Him again all the members of the Body will once again become lovable to us
The more we enjoy Christ, the more we will realize experientially that the Christ whom we enjoy is the Head of the Body
What we absorb of Christ into us-the element of the riches of Himself as the soil-becomes the increase of God within us
The genuine growth in life is to grow with the growth of God, that is, to grow with the increase of God, the addition of God
These riches are the elements of God, which become in the members of the Body the increase of God by which the whole Body grows
Christ as the life of the saints is the highest enjoyment; no other enjoyment is superior to Christ as our life
The extensive, all-inclusive Christ is subjective to us, for He dwells in us as our hope of glory and is our life
We should not think that God has one life, that Christ has another life, and that we who believe in Christ have yet another life
In the new man there is no race, no nationality, no social rank, for in the new man Christ is all the members and is in all the members
In 3:1 Paul also says, 'If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is'
The heavens are joined to the church therefore to live in the heavens is simply to live in the church for the church and the heavens are one
Because our life is hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth
Inwardly, we have Christ as our life, and outwardly, we have God as our realm and sphere in which we live and walk
Christ came by incarnation to bring God into us, and He went back to God by crucifixion and resurrection to bring us into God
Concerning this two-way traffic, we should see that Christ came both to work God into us and to bring us into God
The Lord is in the Father, and He prayed that the disciples, who were not yet in the Father, would be brought into Him
What makes this fact that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven real to us is that we are one spirit with the Lord
It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially
Today our life is hidden with Christ in God, but one day Christ will appear, and we will be manifested with Him in glory
Whenever we are in the spirit, we are raised up and have the sense that we are in God, far above everything and everyone
In Exodus 16:33 we see that an omerful of manna was placed in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept for future generations
If we truly know this life, when we are insulted, we will not say anything but instead thank the Lord and even praise Him in a genuine way
In Colossians 3:1 Paul says that since we were raised together with Christ, we should seek the things which are above
When we are in spirit, we are also in heaven, but when we are not in spirit, we are on earth and, experientially, even under the earth
There is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit
In Colossians 3:2 Paul continues, 'Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth'
In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have 'a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God'
When we call on the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we sense that something from the heavens is being transmitted into us
The Holy of Holies in the heavens is connected to our spirit; therefore, in experience, our regenerated spirit is also the Holy of Holies
As the High Priest, He is interceding for us, and as the heavenly Minister, He is supplying us with the riches of God
The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne and has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God
He is the Lamb with seven eyes, with the seven Spirits of God, carrying out God's administration through the local churches
The riches of Christ's heavenly ministry will be transmitted into us, and we will be transformed and constituted of Christ
Lasting thirty-three and a half years, this ministry began with Christ's incarnation and was concluded with His crucifixion
The Body of Christ needs the heavenly ministry of Christ, the ministry of Christ above, in order to be built up
To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them are to join ourselves to the Lord in His ministry in heaven
If we seek the things which are above and have one living with Christ, we will be wholly occupied with the enterprise of our Master
Our heart will be with Him in heaven, where He is interceding for the churches, supplying the saints, and administrating God's government
To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them are to live Christ, to have one living with Him
Christ is in heaven interceding, ministering, and administrating, and we are on earth responding to Christ's activity in heaven
It is possible that among many genuine Christians today the connection with the heavenly Christ in their experience has been severed
We may be genuine Christians, but we may not experience the divine current, and there is no fellowship between us and the Lord
Of being cut off from the heavenly Christ, in our experience we need to continually receive the divine transmission
Day and night, we should be infused with a supply from heaven and experience the transaction between the heavenly Christ and us
When we set our mind on the things which are above during our times of prayer, we become a reflection of Christ's ministry in the heavens
Christ accomplished redemption not merely to save us from sin, but even the more to impart Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit
When we open our being and set our mind on the things above, this Spirit transmits the riches of the divine life into us
In Colossians 3:4 Paul continues, 'When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory'
At the appointed time, the time for a divinely-ordained display, there will be the manifestation of the sons of God in glory
In our sinful members is the law of sin, making us captives of sin and causing our corrupted body to become the body of death
Our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness
In Colossians 3:6 Paul points out that because of these things 'the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience'
We execute Christ's death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit
According to Romans 8:11 and 13, putting to death the practices the body is an action carried out in the power of the Spirit
In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, 'Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices'
We put to death the physical lusts, then we put away the psychological evils, and last, we put off the entire old man with his practices
The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life, whereas the emphasis on the church being the new man is on the person
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
The new man is the corporate God-man, with Christ-the firstborn Son-as the Head, and the believers-the many sons of God-as the Body
When we live by taking Christ as our person, especially in making decisions, our living will be the living of the new man
On the one hand, Paul speaks of the creation of the new man ; on the other hand, he refers to the renewing of the new man
Because the divine life and nature have been added to our spirit, our regenerated spirit has become part of the new creation
The reason the regenerated spirit is part of the new creation and of the new man is that the life and nature of God have come into it
There is the need for the divine life and nature to spread from our spirit into our soul and to saturate the soul
As the divine life and nature spread from our regenerated spirit into the mind, emotion, and will, our soul will be renewed
Even though we have been regenerated, we are often inclined to live according to the old man, that is, to live according to the old creation
On the one hand, in our spirit the new man was created with new elements, the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit
In Colossians 3:10 Paul says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge 'according to the image of Him who created him'
The renewing of the new man results in full knowledge and that this full knowledge is according to the image of God
The image of God in Colossians 1:15 refers to the expression of God and the fullness of God, that is, Christ Himself
We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, that is, according to Christ as God's image
Both in spiritual experience and in human experience, the mind affects the emotion, and the emotion affects the will
Although we still need a great deal more renewing, we nevertheless have a certain amount of knowledge of the Lord Jesus
The central point of Paul's word to the Colossians concerns the renewing of the mind unto the full knowledge of Christ
The renewing that takes place in our mind unto full knowledge according to the image of God creates appreciation within us for the Lord
When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the new man to spread the divine element from our spirit into our soul
Although we have been regenerated, we may have very little of the image of Christ in our mind, emotion, and will
Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person to exist
There cannot be circumcision-the observers of the Jewish religious rituals-and uncircumcision-those who do not care for the Jewish religion
No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies
The new man does not come into existence by taking Christians from various countries and bringing them together
The new man comes into being as we are saturated, filled, and permeated with Christ and replaced by Him through an organic process
The more we open to the Lord and contact Him in this way, the more He infuses Himself into us and fills us to the brim
Those from America will no longer live an American life, and those from Japan will no longer live a Japanese life
On the one hand, the Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person, because Christ is all the members
To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us
Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, there should be no differences among the believers who are part of this new man
In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all the wonderful virtues, all the good things, and all the positive attributes
If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, we need to be ruled by the peace of Christ and inhabited by the word of Christ
It is crucial that the peace of Christ be allowed to preside in our hearts and to speak the final word regarding any controversy among us
All our inward parts-our mind, emotion, will, heart, and spirit-must be empty, available to be filled with the word of Christ
We touch the reality of the one new man, where there is no Greek or Jew, barbarian or Scythian, circumcision or uncircumcision
We realize that the new man is constituted with Christ alone and that in this realm there are no differences of culture
In 3:3 and 4 we see that the Christ who is the focal point of God's economy and the reality of all the positive things is our life
One aspect of our hope, which we may call the hope of the church, is the coming Christ, that is, Christ in His coming
While we live on the earth as believers and witnesses of Christ, we experience suffering, for which we need endurance
Often we cannot and would not do certain things, and we determine to not be defeated, simply because we realize that we will see the Lord
Our hope is in the coming Christ with His glory; the endurance of this hope brings about the long life of our work of faith
What a glory it would be to any Christian worker for the ones whom he has fostered to be matured at the Lord's coming back!
Those who have been edified, supplied, shepherded, and led by us will be our crown, joy, and boast before the Lord
The establishing of our heart is the result of the perfecting of our faith and of the increase and abounding of our love
Holiness refers to the element itself, and sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified
To be in holiness is to be in the element, and to be in sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy
God is the unchanging One but according to our natural birth our heart is changeable both in our relationship with others and with the Lord
In Gods salvation the renewing of the heart is once for all but in our experience our heart is renewed continually because it is changeable
If our heart is established by Him, we will be those whose hearts have been separated unto the Lord, occupied by Him, and saturated with Him
If we have such a heart, then the heart will be established blameless in holiness, blameless in the state of being made holy
In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ in His coming as the hope of the church
To the believers, however, Paul presents in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 a basic concept of the hope of our Christian life
He wants to impress us with the fact that the Christian life, which is a holy life for the church life, has a hope
The fact that verse 16 says that the dead in Christ will rise indicates that they must be in some place other than heaven
The dead will be raised, and then the living believers will be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air
The sinners now in the section of torment in Hades are awaiting the final judgment, which will take place at the white throne of God
They will not rise up to heaven; rather, they will rise up, and then the living saints will be caught up together with them in the clouds
According to verse 17, those who are living will be caught up at the same time with the dead believers to meet the Lord in the air
At His coming back, the saints who have died will rise up from Paradise and the tomb to be caught up with those who are alive and remain
Verse 1 says, 'Concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you'
In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, 'For you yourselves know perfectly well that like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes'
The day of the Lord in chapter 5 is mainly for warning , since it is mentioned in the Word mostly in relation to the Lord's judgment
The fact that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night indicates that its coming is kept secret and that it will come suddenly
When the Lord Jesus comes and we are raptured, we will be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation
In verse 6 he exhorts us to watch and be sober: 'So then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober'
In verse 7 Paul says, 'For those who sleep, sleep during the night, and those who get drunk are drunk during the night'
Faith, love, and hope are the three basic constructing elements of the genuine Christian life, as depicted in 1 Thessalonians 1:3
At the beginning of the Epistle, the apostle praised the believers' work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope
At the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorted them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them
If we would protect these aspects of the basic structure of a holy life for the church life, we need to be watchful and sober
The fact that watchfulness is related to fighting is confirmed by Paul's mention of the breastplate and helmet in verse 8
In these verses to be watchful is to remember that we are in a battle, that we are fighting and are surrounded by enemies
In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ in His coming as the hope of the church
The soul is our self , a medium between our spirit and our body, possessing self-consciousness, that we may have our personality
The body as our external part is the outer organ, possessing world-consciousness, that we may contact the material world
In the spirit, God as the Spirit dwells; in the soul, our self dwells; and in the body, the physical senses dwell
By sanctifying us, God transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature
Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect
God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being-our spirit, soul, or body-will be left common or profane
God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element , our soul from remaining natural and old , and our body from the ruin of sin
In the second part of verse 23 Paul says, 'May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame'
In the second part of the verse concerning our spirit, soul, and body being preserved, we are the ones who should take the initiative
In the shining of His light which exposes us, we should confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins
At the Lord's coming back they will be relieved of their sufferings and enter into the Lord's rest and enjoy its liberty
In 2 Thessalonians 21 Paul says Now we ask you brothers with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him
During the time in which the Lord's parousia remains in the air, the majority of the believers will be raptured to meet the Lord there
The Greek word translated deceive may also be rendered beguile which means not only making a false impression but actually leading astray
One day this temple will be rebuilt, and, according to the prophecy of Daniel, Antichrist will seat himself in it
In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, 'Now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time'
In verse 7 Paul continues It is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way
Although the mystery of lawlessness is already operating, this lawlessness is at the present time restrained, restricted
Speaking of Antichrist in verse 9 Paul says The coming of whom is according to Satans operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie
The entire operation of Satan to deceive people is in its totality a lie, just as he is a liar and the father of liars
At present, although the mystery of lawlessness is already working, there is a restraining factor, but one day this factor will be removed
The Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the manifestation of His coming
After the apostasy and the revealing of the man of lawlessness, there will be the appearing of the Lord's parousia
Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way , just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus
Christ Jesus, as the Savior of sinners, came into the world, into the fallen human race, to save this foremost sinner
Because Saul was one who blasphemed God and persecuted man, God's mercy reached him before the Lord's grace did
The Lords grace coming after Gods mercy visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ
The uncreated life of God is the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ
When we enjoy Christ as our great Savior and receive His wonderful salvation, the result of this enjoyment is eternal life
In verse 17 Paul says, 'Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever
Because He is both man and God, He is the only One qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men
He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human person but also in His redemptive work
The transition from the mystery of godliness to He implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
Rather, it reveals that God was manifested in the flesh, indicating that the entire God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-was incarnated
The God who the Word is, is not a partial God but the entire God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit
The Word who became flesh-God manifested in the flesh-is God's definition, explanation, and expression in the flesh
God was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man in the person of Christ, living on earth as a God-man
From the first day He lived on earth, He lived a crucified human life, not by His human life but by His divine life
The incarnation of Christ produced a God-man who lived on the earth not by His human life but by His divine life
Mortal is versus eternal, finite is versus infinite, visible is versus invisible, and inglorious is versus glorious
God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and present everywhere, but man is limited in power, knowledge, and presence
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He expressed the divine attributes as His human virtues in all His actions
These Christian virtues are expressions of the divine attributes and are the manifestation of God in the flesh
If we do things in resurrection, many virtues will be exhibited, and those virtues will be the expression of the divine attributes
The church life is the expression of God; therefore, the mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church
God is manifested in the church-the house of God and the Body of Christ-as His enlarged corporate expression in the flesh
The principle of incarnation is that God enters into man and mingles Himself with man to make man one with Himself
We are the same as God in the divine life, the divine nature, the divine element, and the divine essence but not in the Godhead
To exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit so that we may express the mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh
Paul exhorted Timothy to pray for those 'who are in high position; that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and gravity'
In whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we wear, there should be an impression that God is manifested in us
Not only is Christ the great mystery of godliness, but in principle the church is also God manifested in the flesh
When we meet together in the Spirit, God is manifested among us; this is the manifestation of God in the flesh
We admit that we are still flesh, but the God who lives in our spirit will be manifested, expressed, in our flesh
If we walk and live in our spirit, we will have a justified life, that is, a life that can be justified by God
If the demons trembled at the presence of the Lord Jesus, will they not also tremble at the manifestation of the living God in the church?
No doubt when the church is living out God and manifesting Him, the demons and the evil angels will be terrified
When the churches come up to God's standard, the angels will sing and rejoice, and the demons and the evil angels will tremble
All the angels are spectators who are looking at the universal man, Christ and the church, living in the spirit to manifest God in the flesh
Christ as the embodiment of God in the flesh has been believed on, received as Savior and life, by people in the world
When this gospel is preached, other human beings will see what we are living and then receive what we are living
Regardless of how much believers preach by speaking, what eventually causes sinners to believe is the testimony of the believers' living
According to the sequence of historical events, Christ's ascension preceded His being preached among the nations
It implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh
In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul speaks of the house of God, which is 'the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth'
A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church
The word reality is better than truth in conveying the proper meaning, because truth can be misunderstood as doctrines
Truth is not vain doctrine; it is the expression of reality, doctrine constituted with reality and conveying that reality
That this reality, this truth, has become flesh is indicated by verse 17, which says, 'Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ'
As a pillar and base of the truth, the church upholds and presents to the universe the fact of God's manifestation in the flesh
In summary, God manifested in the flesh implies God manifested not only in Christ, the Head, but also in the church, His Body
The manifestation of God first in the flesh of Christ and then in the flesh of the members of His Body is a great mystery
Today the church is not only the manifestation of God in the flesh but also the bearer of the truth of the living God
The church is the pillar and base of the truth, bearing the Triune God Himself, who is the unique reality in the universe
Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, Old Testament saints such as Abraham and David did not experience it
The grace which came through Jesus Christ is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment
Today in the church life grace is nullifying death and bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel
Christ's resurrection was not only God's vindication and the Lord's success but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave
Having nullified death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection
The last part of verse 10 speaks of Christ Jesus who 'brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel'
In the gospel the revelation is brought to us that Christ has nullified death and has brought us eternal, indestructible life
Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life's saturating of our body
Timothy 11 speaks of Paul as an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus
The expression the promise of life in 2 Timothy 1:1 does not mean that we have only the promise and not the life
Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him
Because the new testament economy is higher than the old testament economy, to be an apostle is higher than to be a priest
The divine life can do so much for us that by enjoying Christ as the One who brought life to light, we may serve God as apostles
For such a gospel Paul was appointed an apostle, one who sets up and establishes the churches for God's administration
Divine life was promised in the Old Testament, and this great promise of life is repeated and developed in the New Testament
It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow worker and spiritual child, Timothy
With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God was laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation
Because this life dwelt in Paul, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him
In verse 8 Paul says, 'Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel'
The expression seed of David indicates Christ's dignified human nature, which was exalted and glorified along with His divine nature
The apostle endured all sufferings for the sake of us, the chosen ones, that we too may obtain salvation, as he did
Whereas 2 Timothy 1:1 reveals that the promised life constituted Paul an apostle, 2:1 unveils that grace empowered Timothy
These two verses show that we may serve God not only by the constituting of the promised life but also by the empowering of grace
In 2 Timothy 3:11-12 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the deliverer of the believers from persecutions
In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think that they are serving God
Out of their zeal for God, they will kill the followers of the Lord, simply because these ones do not follow the traditional way
Eventually, all the persecuted and martyred believers will be delivered by the resurrection power of Christ into His heavenly kingdom
In 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, 'I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead'
The Lord's appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us , and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers
In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says that he will be awarded with the crown of righteousness by the Lord, the righteous Judge
Paul seriously warns and charges Timothy, not by love nor by kindness, but by the Lord's appearing and by His kingdom
According to Paul's charge in verse 1, Timothy was to live in the light of the appearing of the Lord and His kingdom
If we live in His appearing, we would certainly refrain from quarreling; we would not want to be found arguing when the Lord appears
If we read the New Testament, especially the Epistles, we will see that the apostles lived with the appearing of the Lord in view
If we take seriously the matters of the Lord's appearing and the kingdom, they will greatly affect our daily living
The crown, a symbol of glory, is given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
In contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith , this prize is not of grace nor by faith, but is of righteousness through works
The believers will be recompensed with such a reward, not according to the Lord's grace but according to His righteousness
Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and that he would be recompensed with it at the day of the Lord's second appearing
We all need to receive this charge before God and before the Lord Jesus, the One who will judge the living and the dead
We must declare the fact that when the Lord comes back, He will be the Judge of all, both believers and unbelievers
Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving the Lord's appearing, mentioned in verse 8
Paul suffered a great deal of persecution, yet he was confident that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work
Such a deliverance is what we believers should believe in, hope for, and experience, and it is also what the Lord is pleased to give us
It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8 and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly race
When Paul made this declaration that he expected to enter into the kingdom, he was being rejected by all the churches in Asia
He knew that although he was rejected by earthly men, God would save him into His kingdom, because he had given up the world to gain Christ
In Paul there was no thought of something miraculous, but instead, his thought was full of the spiritual, divine reality
No matter how good the worldly system may seem to be, it is still according to the course of this age, and therefore it is no doubt of Satan
Whatever we have must be something of God, absolutely different from the worldly system and contrary to the course of this age
By His wisdom God ordained us before the ages unto this glory , and the God of all grace called us and saved us into this eternal glory
In Titus 2:13 Paul says to Timothy, 'Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ'
In Titus 3:5-7 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the means of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit
Only the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, brought to us by God's mercy, are sufficient to cause us to be saved
The only other place the word is used is Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium
In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation
The renewing in God's organic salvation is also by our walking in the newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ
In order to walk in newness of life, we need, on the one hand, to put off the old man, and on the other hand, to put on the new man
We should have such a daily subjective experience of our outer man decaying and our inner man being renewed day by day
Through such a renewing we are built up in God's organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem
In 3:7 Paul goes on to say, 'In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life'
According to verse 7, the believers are not merely sons but heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father's estate
The riches of God are not merely what we will inherit in the distant future; they should be our present enjoyment
If we believers do not enjoy the foretaste of what we will inherit of God, we will miss the full taste in the coming age of the millennium
Regeneration involves a change by life, with life, and in life and brings in a washing by the divine life as the washing water
The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the work of the Spirit to transform us into the image of Christ from glory to glory
Through the long process of being renewed unto glorification we will be heirs to inherit what God promised as a reward in the coming kingdom
Since Philemon had refreshed the inward parts of the saints, Paul now asked him to do the same for him in the Lord
According to verse 20, the profit in the Lord that Paul speaks of refers to being refreshed in his inward parts in Christ Jesus
Since the imprisoned apostle was suffering under persecution, he needed Philemon, a fellow believer, to refresh his inward parts
