   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Living Christ Every Day</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some elders and deacons among us are not able to speak about the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not know the mystery of the faith, how can we hold it?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mystery of the faith refers mainly to Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, to hold the mystery of God in a pure conscience is to hold Christ, that is, to live Christ out every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we were saved, we lived and acted recklessly; we lied and cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we were saved, our conscience was enlightened, and we became sensitive toward these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We could no longer cheat or lie; instead, we conducted ourselves properly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Gradually, we saw that the mystery of God was Christ, not morality, ethics, honesty, faithfulness, righteousness, or holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We did not steal or lie, but neither did we live Christ from morning to evening every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that we only lived the life of a proper, moral, and ethical Chinese person; we did not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, our conscience still condemned us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were saved, we loved the Lord, and we stood in the Lord s recovery for the Lord s testimony, but our testimony was a testimony of morality instead of a testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, rather than confessing for losing our temper or lying, we need to say, Lord, forgive me for not living You today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People saw my morality, but they did not see You in me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such an experience proves that we have seen not only the truth but also the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Living in the Body Every Day</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Holding the church as the mystery of Christ in a pure conscience includes not only living Christ every day but also living in the Body every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not live Christ by ourselves; we live Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Living Christ and also living in the Body of Christ causes the devil to fear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are people who live in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While instructing the elders and the deacons, Paul tells the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience 1 Tim 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the deacons should live Christ in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not live Christ in His Body, our conscience will be bothered by the shining of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our conscience will condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we might not have any wrongdoings, our life is not a life in the Body of Christ nor a life that lives out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our conscience, which has been enlightened, must be so pure that it wants nothing other than Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then our conscience will not condemn us, and we will have a pure conscience to hold the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>People in the world may know that we believe in Jesus, but they do not know the mystery of our faith in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mystery of our faith in Jesus is to live Christ and to live Christ in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The testimony of the church depends upon whether the serving ones the elders and deacons know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They not only need to know the truth, but they need to keep the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If all the elders and deacons do this, the church will be strong and rich, and it will be able to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life Being to Live the Life of Christ in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition to the truth, there is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Truth and life cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life is to live the life of Christ in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you ask me why I have my hair styled in this way, I would say that it is based on my living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because I live Christ, my conscience determines how long or how short my hair should be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Similarly, if the elders and the deacons know the truth and live Christ in the Body, that church will be strong and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first matter that we need is to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, that is, to live Christ in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the highest standard of morality, and it is much higher than the standard of morality in society.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would be in the Lord s recovery, we must live Christ in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is more than the four ethical standards in Chinese culture: being faithful, filial, kind, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is to live the living Christ in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Galatians 2:20 says, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Philippians 1:21 says, To me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a matter of being kind or loving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This transcends human kindness and love, because Christ transcends human kindness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christianity has lost this, and the Lord is recovering this today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders, deacons, and co-workers need a clear understanding of this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many young full-timers grow and make progress because of their growth in the truth and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I encourage you to read the Bible diligently so that you can see the truth, be enlightened, and have a living that expresses Christ in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is life, and the foundation of life is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, truth and life cannot be separated, and they issue in one testimony the church life.</S>
