I am not concerned for doctrine, but for your living. In your daily life do you live the life that Christ is living within you? Perhaps as you get up in the morning, you want to talk, but He does not. In such a case there is a discrepancy between your living and His. Normally, your living and His living should be one. But instead of this, in your talking too often there are two persons with two different livings instead of two persons with one living. Therefore, as you are about to talk about a certain brother, the Lord, who does not want to talk, moves within you to give you a certain feeling. You sense something moving within. Nevertheless, many times you do not care for this inner feeling. Thus, although the Lord does not want to talk, you proceed to talk anyway, sometimes gossiping for more than an hour. All this talk is disobedient to God's inner working. When you gossip in this way, you are not obeying the anointing.</P><P>The problem here is that in our talking we very often get off the cross. When Christ was on the cross, He was tempted to prove that He was the Son of God by coming down from the cross (Matt. 27:40). Although the Lord did not come down from the cross, we do so very often, even many times in one day. I must confess that this has been my own experience. I am familiar with this illness because I have suffered from it myself for years. Therefore, I can illustrate this according to my experience. Early in the morning, I may talk too much. Unable to eat breakfast in a good way because I am condemned for this, I go to my room and confess to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I confess how natural I am. Please forgive me. I hate my natural man and my talkativeness. Lord, put my tongue on the cross." Every kind of repentance and confession is a killing. After being killed in this way, I am on the cross again. But later in the day some brothers may come to visit me, and again I may find myself talking too much. Although something within tells me to be quiet, I keep talking. It seems that there are no brakes on my spiritual car. Later, I regret my talkativeness and confess to the Lord once again. This time it is difficult even to speak to the Lord, because I feel so ashamed in His presence. Nevertheless, I ask Him to forgive me once again. Through my confession, I get on the cross once again. I believe that this is not only my experience, but also yours.</P><P>The problem is that we get off the cross. Yes, it is a fact that we have been crucified with Christ, but are we on the cross right now? The secret of taking care of the inner anointing is to stay on the cross.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_114.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_116.html">Next</a> </body></html>
