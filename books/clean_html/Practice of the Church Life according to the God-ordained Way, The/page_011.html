<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. "A King," "the Philosophy of a King"</H2><P>Third, one of the dissenters said that among us there is the problem of "a king." He also said that there is the problem of "the philosophy of a king" (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, published by Living Stream Ministry, pages 100-101). This means that in their conspiracy the dissenting ones wanted to put down the philosophy of a king. In using the term "the philosophy of a king," the dissenters mean that in the recovery there is a strong teaching concerning a definite leader among us. The word philosophy here means logic or teaching, and the king here refers to a leader.</P><P>In the New Testament, in one sense, there is the philosophy, or teaching, of a definite leader among God's people, and in another sense, there is not such a teaching. Of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament, fourteen were written by the apostle Paul. In his Epistles he was very strong to emphasize the leadership. In 1 Corinthians 4:16, 11:1, and Philippians 3:17, Paul entreated the saints to imitate him because he imitated Christ. In Hebrews 13:17 he charged the believers to "obey the ones leading you and submit to them." Verses such as these indicate that there is teaching in the New Testament concerning the leadership. However, neither the New Testament nor my ministry teaches anyone to be a king. Although the apostle Paul taught strongly concerning leadership, in 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said that the apostles preached Christ Jesus as Lord, and themselves as the believers' slaves for Jesus' sake. This indicates that we are not kings but are slaves to serve the saints.</P><P>In speaking of "a king," no doubt the dissenting ones are referring to me. I have been with the saints and the churches in the United States for more than thirty years. To whom have I been a king? Such a statement concerning me is a reviling, not merely a defamation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Control of the Churches<br>by the Living Stream Ministry Office</H2><P>Fourth, the dissenters have accused the Living Stream Ministry office of controlling the churches. But I would ask, which church has the office controlled? They say that the office gave orders to the churches, commanding the churches to do certain things. However, this kind of accusation is false. The Living Stream Ministry office serves hundreds of churches. The office does not give orders to the churches, but it does ask the churches to coordinate with the office. For instance, in printing our books, it is difficult to decide how many copies we should print. In the initial years we did not have a proper way to make this decision; consequently, we printed more copies of some of the books than were needed. Eventually, the office asked the churches to submit standing orders for books and tapes. This has been a great help to the office. Sometimes, when a church has not submitted its standing order, the office asks the church to turn in its order. This is not the issuing of a command to that church but merely an asking of that church for its cooperation. The ministry office has also had to coordinate among the churches the procedure for the distribution and viewing of the video tapes of the semiannual trainings. It is mainly concerning these kinds of things that the office has communicated with the churches to coordinate with them. Besides these things, I cannot find any evidence that the Living Stream office controls any church. After hearing such an accusation, I asked any church who felt that they were under the control of the office to inform me of this, but to this date no church has confirmed this accusation.</P>
