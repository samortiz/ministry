   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SEED OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 1:1, 2, 6, 11, 16-18, 20, 21, 23; 2:1-13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, the kingdom is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into us, growing in us, spreading in us, and maturing in us until there is a full harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The full harvest is the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first chapter of the New Testament we have the record of a wonderful One, Christ, who is recommended to us as the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need a deeper understanding concerning this seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may say that the seed of the kingdom is the Lord Jesus; yet your understanding of who He really is may be quite superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SPIRIT OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is easy to read the black and white letters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also easy to gather some meaning or impression from reading in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, to read the words of the Bible is one thing, but to see the spiritual significance is another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, when the Pharisees argued with the Lord Jesus about divorce, even using the Scriptures, He replied in a very unusual way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said, "From the beginning it has not been so" Matt 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On another occasion, the Sadducees argued with the Lord Jesus about the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were the modernists of that day who did not believe in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They quoted some verses from the Bible, and the Lord Jesus also quoted a verse Matt 22:23-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He spoke of the title of God from Exodus 3:6, "I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read only the black and white letters, we will understand that God is the God of these three: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even elementary students can read and understand that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus unveiled something of life and resurrection from this title of God!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all three are dead, and since God is a God of the living and not of the dead, God must surely be the God of resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this the Lord Jesus also proved that all these dead saints will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a spiritual revelation is contained in the black and white letters, but we cannot see it simply by the letters; we need something more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In one sense, it is easy to read chapter one of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the genealogy of "Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not difficult to understand that these were the forefathers of the Lord Jesus, and that Mary was His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But what we need concerning this chapter is revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to know the kingdom we must know the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is this seed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may say that the seed is the Lord Jesus, but what is He?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not ask who the Lord Jesus is, but what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need something far beyond a mere doctrinal answer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need revelation to see that the Lord Jesus is the issue of so many human generations mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One who came out of the mingling of so many human generations with the Triune God is called Jesus and Emmanuel Matt 1:21, 23 .</S>
