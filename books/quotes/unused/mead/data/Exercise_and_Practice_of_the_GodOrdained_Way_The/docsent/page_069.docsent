   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT STUMBLING THE NEWBORN BABES Concerning Idols</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are some very difficult situations that you will eventually encounter in preaching the gospel and caring for the newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first of these is the matter of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A certain man may have been saved through your preaching three days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you go back to his home to hold a home meeting with him, he may immediately ask you, "What are idols?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have to learn how to "play" with him, that is, to answer him as you would talk to a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must learn to have this kind of attitude and tone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may say, "What do you mean, idols?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you talking about some images?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the way to "play" with this babe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he may answer you by pointing out certain things which he considers might be idols and may say, "Isn't this thing an idol?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then you can pick up his feeling and answer, "Yes, this is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What else?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that the matter of idols is an easy item to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a very difficult matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A number of the newly saved ones have been stumbled by this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you feed them in many other matters they would accept it, but when you come to the matter of idols, they might not accept your word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is especially true with the Chinese concerning the worship of their ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many would not forsake this practice, so it is hard to know how to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, we cannot say that it is all right, yet if we condemn this in the wrong manner, we will lose them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, you must remember that this one is only a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He knows many things, yet he knows nothing concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must learn to "play" with him in your conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While you are talking to him as to a babe, you have to look to the Lord for the wisdom to handle the situation without stumbling him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, you will be able to convince him, but not like a professor convincing a student.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That kind of attitude can never work out anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must hold the attitude that you are talking to a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning the Clearance of the Past</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another difficult item is the matter of making restitution for past transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all did things that were wrong in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all wronged others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes we wronged others financially in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a new one has been saved, they will sooner or later encounter this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be very careful not to bring up this problem too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament, there is no teaching that charges us to tell the newly saved ones to clear their past.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To do this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's dynamic salvation will work out this result.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Zaccheus was saved, and immediately he told the Lord, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much" Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was a dynamic reaction to the Lord's dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not the result of any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts 19 many of the Ephesians took their idolatrous books and burned them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were not taught to do this; it was a spontaneous reaction to the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when we come to such a problem, we must remember that the new ones are babes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have come to know something, yet they do not understand it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They might be serious about the idols, yet it is better for you to talk to them in a way that is not so serious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then they will receive your word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You all have to learn this, not only with idols and with the clearance of the past, but with many items.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because you have helped them to read the Bible, sooner or later, they will bring up these kinds of questions from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nearly every time you go back to visit them, they will bring up some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In handling these questions, you must always try to talk to them with the attitude and tone that you are talking to a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you learn to do this properly, people will welcome you.</S>
