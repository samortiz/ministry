   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God's farm, God's cultivated land v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>9 , to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This concept fits in with the Lord's word in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said that He sowed Himself as the seed and that we are the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the essence of the seed and the essence of the earth come together and are mingled together, some constituting work is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we grow up to become "Christ-trees."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul told us not only that we are God's farm to grow Christ but also that we are God's building v. 9 . God's building is not of the plant life but is solely of minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Look at the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What will be there?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Jerusalem is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The city has twelve foundations and these foundations are twelve layers of precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>14, 19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the first foundation is jasper v. 19 , the wall of the city is jasper v. 18 , and the light of the entire city is like a jasper stone v. 11 . God's appearance is like jasper 4:3 , so the entire New Jerusalem bears the appearance of God and expresses God by her shining.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God sitting on the throne looks like jasper, and we, the entire city, bear His appearance, so we are His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Jerusalem also has twelve pearls as its twelve gates 21:21 , and the city itself is pure gold v. 18 . Nothing in the New Jerusalem can be burned because it is not of the plant life but it is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible first uses plants to illustrate the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seed sown into the earth grows, but by itself it cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It needs some essence from the earth to match its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two essences then grow together to enlarge the seed into a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a picture of our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we are growing in life, we are also being transformed in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Petrified wood is a good illustration of plant life which has been transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Precious stones are actually transformed materials produced through tremendous heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we were saved, we were like green, tender sprouts, but gradually we will become precious stones through being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The garden of Eden, at the beginning of the Bible, eventually becomes a city, at the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are on the way from being a garden to being a city through the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This way is a long way, and this long way is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ told us that He is the way John 14:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we received Christ, we became one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we began to follow Him and He became our way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are still on the way, and our destination or our destiny is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we are still mostly plants, but we are being transformed into precious stones for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How much the church has been built up all depends upon how much we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are growing, we are being transformed from plants into minerals, that is, into precious stones for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the clear vision in the Bible.</S>
