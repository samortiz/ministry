   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Israel's Fall into Fornication and Idolatry</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 23:21 says that God has not beheld iniquity in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Numbers 25, however, we have a record of Israel's iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This iniquity comprises two ugly things: fornication, which destroys the person of the God-created man, and idolatry, which insults the divine person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the record of the Bible, fornication and idolatry go together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where there is fornication, there is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Roman Catholic Church is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament the Catholic Church is likened to Jezebel, a woman of fornication Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in the Catholic Church there is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, in his book The Great Prophecies, G. H. Pember points out that even Buddha, under the name of Saint Josaphat, has entered into Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Catholic calendar there is a saint named Josaphat, whose story is actually that of Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Balak was unable to defeat Israel militarily or politically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither could he defeat Israel through the use of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, under the influence of Balaam Rev 2:14 , he induced Israel to fall into fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is likely that Balak and Balaam joined in a conspiracy and plotted against Israel, with Balaam being Balak's counselor and advisor, teaching Balak how to stumble God's holy, perfect, and beautiful people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The plot was initiated by Balaam, and it was put into practice by Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Israel's positive characteristics were annulled by the fall into fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of being holy, perfect, and beautiful, they became a people of fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Israelites Committing Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>with the Daughters of Moab</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and Yoking Themselves to Baal of Peor</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"While Israel dwelt in Shittim, the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And these invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor" Num 25:1-3a .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses indicate that those who committed fornication became yoked to Baal, the god of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, there was a combination of fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The worshippers of Baal were fornicators, and they induced others to commit fornication with them and to worship the idol of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the evil counsel of Balaam 31:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Stumbling over the Stumbling Block</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Set by Balak, Who Was Taught by Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 2:14 speaks of "the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Balaam taught Balak how to use idolatry and fornication to stumble Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Anger of Jehovah Burned against Israel</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"The anger of Jehovah burned against Israel" Num 25:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He commanded Moses to take all the leaders of the people and hang them in the sun v. 4 . To be hanged in the sun was a great public shame.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moses then commanded the judges of Israel to slay every Israelite male who had yoked himself to Baal of Peor v. 5 . Moreover, twenty-four thousand people were killed by a plague v. 9 .</S>
