   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN FOR GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James Yen: Can a person receive God's word and at the same time promises from Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: Even when we have God's word and promises, we cannot say immediately that this is God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to learn to continually touch God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time we gain some experience, we learn something and acquire some spiritual feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every experience will increase our spiritual perception and make us more accurate in touching God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only those whose outer man is broken can touch divine things accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the outer man is not broken, a person cannot be entrusted with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The outer man is always a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All problems hinge on an unbroken outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man of prayer seeks God's will, is broken in the outer man, and is reliable in his spiritual perception.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The trouble with us is that we have our outer man our thoughts, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spirit does not have a body of its own; it does not have a mind, emotion, and will of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it needs to express itself, it does not have a mind, an emotion, or physical strength of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit depends on the mind, emotion, and will of the outer man to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the spirit is restricted by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit cannot be released apart from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The trouble often is that our spirit is willing but our flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for the spirit to come out freely, the outer man must be in subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The outer man must cooperate with the spirit in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, when the spirit calls for the emotion, the latter may spin around in its own orbit and not respond to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The breaking of the outer man is a fundamental experience of a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to see God's revelation and receive His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the outer man is broken, the spirit will no longer suffer any frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people speak many words in their prayers, but their understanding falls far short of T. Austin Sparks's prompt answer: "Everything depends on the breaking of the outer man."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Matthew 17, the disciples asked the Lord why they could not cast out the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They could not understand why the Lord was able to do this in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord answered, saying, "This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet the Lord did not have to fast and pray; He cast the demon out right away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He could do this because His outer man was broken already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During one visit with Miss Barber, I heard a loud noise coming from downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It interrupted our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Miss Barber asked me to listen to the noise and the desperate cry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She asked if I knew what it was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said that it sounded like someone praying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She laughed and said, "There is no need to spend so much energy to force God to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the use of outward commotion when the inner being is not touched at all?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fasting prayer is a means through which the outer man is put to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the outer man is broken, there is no need of fasting prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This prayer merely removes the frustration that is associated with the outer man so that the inner man can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fasting prayer is like crossing the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even when water has flooded both banks of the river, we can still ask God to part the water and open up a way Josh 3:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the outer man is broken, there is no need to go through many steps for the inner man to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: Can a man know if he has any amount of brokenness?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is the extent of brokenness the same eventually for every person?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Watchman Nee: Brokenness is a fundamental experience for everyone, but it is also a progressive experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is always a line that we can trace in this process.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The main thing in this process is shining and revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God in His mercy shines on us and reveals Himself to us, we will know.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is the extent of breaking the same eventually in everyone?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The amount of breaking mainly depends on the lessons each person has learned before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, the breaking of the outer man depends on our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, it depends on the amount of work God has done in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must give ourselves to learn the lessons before we can have the proper experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only those who learn their lessons are able to render help to others.</S>
