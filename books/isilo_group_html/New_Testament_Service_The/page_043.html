<p>By this time the Pharisees realized that it was not so easy to deal with this Jesus; therefore, they asked their disciples to go to Him with the Herodians. &ldquo;Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His talk. And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth and do not care for anyone, for you do not regard the person of men. Tell us therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites? Show Me the tribute money. And they brought to Him a denarius. And He says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? They say, Caesar&rsquo;s. Then He says to them, Pay then what is Caesar&rsquo;s to Caesar, and what is God&rsquo;s to God. And when they heard it, they marveled, and they left Him and went away&rdquo; (Matt. 22:15-22).</p>
<p>The Pharisees were a religious party, patriotic to their Jewish nation, whereas the Herodians were a political party, faithful to the Roman Empire. The Romans were the ancient imperialists, who had occupied the land of Israel. Here, however, these two opposing parties came together to try to entangle the Lord Jesus in His words. &ldquo;Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?&rdquo; This tribute was different from the poll tax, the half-shekel paid to the temple. This was the tax paid to the Roman government, a tax that all the faithful patriotic Jews opposed. They would not pay one penny to the Roman government if they could help it.</p>
<p>These two groups who were otherwise enemies asked Jesus this question to put Him on the spot. If the Lord said they should not pay, then the Herodians would immediately charge Him with being against the Roman government. However, if He said that they must pay, then the faithful Jews would say that He was betraying His country. This was the subtlety of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>We should not think that anyone can succeed in entangling the Lord Jesus. Even if they combined ten parties, they still could not entangle Him. He has a way. Hallelujah! He is Jesus! Do you realize the wisdom in His response? He did not take a penny out of His own pocket. If He had done that, He would have been caught. He asked them to show Him a piece of the Roman money. They&mdash;not He&mdash;had the Roman money. Therefore, they were caught! Jesus is Lord! Then He asked them whose image and inscription were on the coin. They told Him that they were Caesar&rsquo;s. Then the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Pay then what is Caesar&rsquo;s to Caesar,&rdquo; but He did not stop there. He left no ground for the enemy. He also said, &ldquo;And what is God&rsquo;s to God.&rdquo; This silenced them. When they heard this answer, they marveled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD QUESTION: A MATTER OF FAITH</h2>
<p>The Sadducees, somewhat like today&rsquo;s modernists, prided themselves in their knowledge; they came to Him and asked a question. &ldquo;Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies not having children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were seven brothers with us, and the first married and died; and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and third until the seventh. And last of all the woman died. In the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be the wife? For they all had her&rdquo; (Matt. 22:24-28).</p>
<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;You are deceived, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Matt. 22:29-32).</p>
<p>The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection; therefore, they thought they could catch Jesus with this question. In other words, if Jesus said that there was a resurrection, whose wife would this woman be in the resurrection? Jesus told them that they did not know the Scriptures, neither the power of God. For in resurrection there will be no marriage or giving in marriage, for everyone shall be as the angels. As far as the resurrection of the dead is concerned, He asked them if they had not read in the law what God had spoken, &ldquo;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were dead. If there were no resurrection, then God would be a God of the dead. God, however, is the God of the living. This proves that one day Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be resurrected. The Sadducees were astonished at His answer. There was nothing more they could say.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Testament Service &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
