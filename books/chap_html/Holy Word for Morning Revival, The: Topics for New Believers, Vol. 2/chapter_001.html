<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>

<h2 class="head2">God</h2>
<p>What the Bible reveals firstly and lastly is God. Nearly every page of the Bible reveals God. God is the main factor in the divine revelation. The Bible shows us the titles of God and the person of God. Then it goes on to show us His economy and His dispensing. These four things are the alpha of the divine revelation&mdash;God&rsquo;s titles, God&rsquo;s person, God&rsquo;s economy, and the way to accomplish His economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</p>
<p><em>Elohim,</em> Jehovah, and <em>Adonai</em> are the three major, divine titles used for God in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Elohim</h2>
<p><em>Elohim,</em> a plural noun in Hebrew, implies the notions of the strong One and faithfulness, hence, the faithful, strong One. Our God is strong and faithful. He is strong in strength and faithful in word. Whatever He does shows forth His strength. Whatever He says, He will keep. He is the strong, faithful One. <em>Elohim</em> is a uni-plural noun. The plurality of the word <em>Elohim</em> implies the Divine Trinity (Gen. 1:2b; 3:22a; 11:7a; Isa. 6:8a; John 17:11b, 22b; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). This title, denoting the unique yet triune God, is used more than two thousand five hundred times in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Jehovah</h2>
<p>Jehovah is another divine title of God (Gen. 2:4), literally meaning &ldquo;He that is who He is, therefore the eternal I Am.&rdquo; This title primarily denotes the &ldquo;self-existent and ever-existent One&rdquo; (Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:24b, 28a, 58; Rev. 1:4, 8).<sup>15</sup> Self-existing and ever-existing means &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM.&rdquo;<sup>16</sup> His being the I Am signifies that He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity. This title is composed basically of the verb &ldquo;to be.&rdquo; Apart from God, Jehovah, all else is nothing. He is the only One who <em>is,</em> the only One who has the reality of being. The verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; should not be applied absolutely to anyone or anything except Him.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:6 says that &ldquo;he who comes forward to God must believe that He is.&rsquo;&rsquo; According to this verse, God is, and we must believe that He is. God is, but we are not and all things are not either.</p>
<p>As the self-existing One and ever-existing One, God is the reality of every positive thing. The Gospel of John reveals that He is all we need: life, light, food, drink, the pasture, the way, and everything. Therefore, this title of God indicates not only that He exists eternally but also that, in a positive sense, He is everything. Do you need life? God is life. Do you want light? God is light....God exists from eternity to eternity, and He is everything. This is our God.</p>
<p>It is necessary that we know God as the One who is, who was, and who is coming....Are you discouraged by your weakness? One day your weakness will cease to exist, but God will still be. Do not believe in anything other than God. Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away. However, when they are gone, God will continue to be the One who is.<sup>17</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Adonai</h2>
<p><em>Adonai,</em> in Hebrew, denotes Master (Gen. 15:2, 8; Exo. 4:10; cf. Gen. 24:9, 10, 12) and Husband (cf. Gen. 18:12). In Genesis 24 Abraham&rsquo;s old servant called Abraham his master. A slave has a lord, and that lord is his master, his owner, his possessor. In Genesis 18:12, Sarah referred to Abraham as her lord. The husband is the lord to the wife, and the lord is the master. On the one hand, our God is our Master. On the other hand, our God is our Husband. As our Master and our Husband, He is our Lord; He is our <em>Adonai.</em><sup>18</sup></p>
