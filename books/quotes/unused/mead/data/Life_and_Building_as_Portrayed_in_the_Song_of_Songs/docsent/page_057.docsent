   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPECTATION OF TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter eight of the Song of Songs reveals this final stage of our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seeking one expresses it in this way: "O that thou wert as my brother" 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that she expects the Lord to become the same as she is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course some may argue that the New Testament says that we will be the same as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to say that one day we will be like Jesus is not so deep as to say that one day Jesus will be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But whether we are like Him or He is like us, we will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus will be the same as we are!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But, of course, He will not be the same as we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He will be the same as we shall be when we are fully transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some day we will be able to tell all the world to look at us and to look at Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has the human nature, and we do too.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has the divine nature, and we do too.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is so glorious, and we are so shining.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have His nature, and He has ours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are like Him, and He is like us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"O that thou wert as my brother."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a poetic expression of the expectation of the seeking one to be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day she will be transfigured to His likeness, and He will be the same as she is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will be her real brother, with the same nature, with the same life, and from the same source.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>OUTSIDE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then she says something that is very meaningful: "When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised" 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"To find thee without" means outside of this body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we are still under the bondage of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Romans 8:21-23, the whole creation is groaning under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even those who have the Spirit as a foretaste are groaning for the release of this body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How we long to find the Lord without.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even while we are fellowshipping with the Lord in our spirit, we are still in this troublesome flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that we are sitting in the heavenlies, but we are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How much we long to be without!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are meeting the Lord in the flesh, but we expect one day to meet Him outside of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, we will kiss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To find the Lord without is the expectation of such a mature one in the Lord as the seeking one has now become.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can be assured that when we are as mature as she is in chapter eight, we will have no other expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only expectation we will have is that we and the Lord will be exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then, no one can despise us because of this body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our old nature, in our flesh, in this body, there is a real shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my whole Christian life, I have never seen anyone who had no shortage for others to despise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"O that thou wert as my brother When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the factors which cause others to despise us will be swallowed up by our transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, in our flesh, there is a shortage in our natural make-up, no matter who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But one day this lack will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The transfiguration of life in our body will take care of all our shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah!</S>
