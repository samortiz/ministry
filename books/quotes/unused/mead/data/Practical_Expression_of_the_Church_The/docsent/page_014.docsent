   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thirdly, all the work of the apostles and prophets was practically in the local churches and for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the local churches, it is rather difficult to have a practical work to edify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Apostle Paul said, "I teach every where in every church" 1 Cor 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the local churches, Paul simply did not have a place to work or teach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He taught in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the local churches, the Lord's work is impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul said that he ordained or commanded the same thing in all the churches 1 Cor 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, without the local churches, it is rather difficult for the apostles and the Lord's servants to do anything to fulfill the Lord's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The practical work is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The last point is the coordination of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the local churches, how could we as members be practically coordinated together as a Body?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would have the Body life, the church life, in a practical way, we must be coordinated with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose the brothers in Los Angeles did not have the local church, how could they be coordinated?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may talk, teach, and write very much about the coordination of the saints in the Body life, but without the local churches, it is impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do praise the Lord that in these past few years, we have really experienced the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do have something practical with coordination and building together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We thank the Lord that there are local churches with a real submission and a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is something practical, not just a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do have the practicality of the Body life in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are always pressing on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To have a practical church life, we need the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would say one thousand times to all the brothers and sisters that you need a local church!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you not agree that you need a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Timothy 3:15 says that we need to know how to behave ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This could only be practical in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do believe the Lord is going to recover the real and practical church life to prepare His Bride for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>YE ALSO ARE BUILDED</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In closing this chapter, we must read Ephesians 2:21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The following is the best translation: "In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Apostle Paul added verse 22 as a kind of repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that verse 21 is quite adequate: "In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why does he need verse 22?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"In whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is mentioned in verse 21 is the so-called universal church, the whole Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Paul mentions the local church in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Ye" refers to the saints of the local church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Ye also are being builded together for an habitation of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is the habitation of God in verse 22 different from the temple in the Lord in verse 21?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No, the habitation of God in verse 22 is a part of the temple in the Lord in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One is local; the other is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Bible teachers have always said that the book of Ephesians is not about the local church, but the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are right in that this book covers the universal aspect of the church, but it still deals with the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"In whom ye also are being builded together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>" This is the building of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not say that as long as we have the universal church it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how much we have the universal church, we still need "In whom ye also "!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We still need the local church, for without it, there is no practicality of the church.</S>
