   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO LIVING IN THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN WIFE AND HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to 5:22-33, where we see the proper living in the relationship between wife and husband.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. AN ASPECT OF THE LIVING FILLED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 4:1-24 Paul gives us the principle of a life worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This principle is a matter of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From 4:25 through 6:9 Paul presents the details of a proper living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would fulfill all these detailed requirements, we need to live according to the truth and by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, we must live in love and in light, and we must be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, being filled in spirit is an aspect of the life worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is an aspect of the daily living of those who are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when we speak about the relationship between wives and husbands, we should not neglect the infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only by being filled in our spirit can we have a proper married life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WIVES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 22 says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is one of the kinds of subjection implied in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the exhortations concerning married life, the apostle deals first with the wives, since the wives, like Eve in Genesis 3, more easily get out of line than the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, Paul deals with children before parents, and slaves before masters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regarding the relationship between children and parents, most of the problems are caused by the children, not by the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The children are disobedient to their parents, but, in actual practice, the parents are obedient to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true of the relationship between wives and husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Husbands, in your married life, do you obey your wife more than she obeys you, or does she obey you more?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most husbands would have to answer that they obey their wives more than their wives obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may think that it is not right for husbands to obey their wives or for parents to obey their children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although this may seem backwards according to doctrine, it is true according to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If husbands do not know how to obey their wives, they will not have a peaceful married life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any husband who does not obey his wife does not know how to sympathize with her and to love her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for a husband to love his wife, he must sympathize with her and even obey her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only obedience can beget obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only obedience can pay the price to produce obedience in others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a husband never obeys his wife, it will be very difficult for his wife to obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Peter 3:7 says that wives are weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the reason Paul speaks to wives first here in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In his exhortations concerning wives and husbands, children and parents, and slaves and masters, Paul takes care firstly of the weaker side and then of the stronger side.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those on the stronger side should not place demands on those on the weaker side.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a husband realizes that his wife is the weaker vessel, he will not be demanding of her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we have said thus far does not deny the obvious fact in 5:22 that wives are to be subject to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we all are familiar with this exhortation, there is no need for us to say anything to strengthen it or to intensify it.</S>
