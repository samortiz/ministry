<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. A Man Lying with an Engaged Girl<br>in the Field by Overpowering Her</H2><P>Deuteronomy 22:25-27 speaks concerning a man lying with an engaged girl in the field by overpowering her. In this case only the man was to be put to death (v. 25). The girl was not to be condemned, because she cried out in the field and there was no one to save her (v. 27). She was innocent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. A Man Lying with an Unengaged Virgin</H2><P>In the case of a man lying with an unengaged virgin (22:28-29), the man was to give fifty shekels of silver to the virgin's father. The virgin was then to be the man's wife because he humbled her. He was not allowed to send her away all his days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. A Man Not Taking His Father's Wife</H2><P>A man was not to take his father's wife, so that he would not uncover his father's garment (22:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Concerning Divorce</H2><P>In 24:1-4 we have a word concerning divorce. When a man married a woman and, having found some indecency in her, he wrote her a bill of divorce and sent her away, and she went to be another man's wife, and the latter husband despised her and wrote her a bill of divorce and sent her away, the former husband could not return to take her again. Likewise, if the latter husband died, the former husband could not take her again. Such a thing was an abomination before Jehovah. God's people must fear Him in doing all things, for He wants to see that His people are pure and decent in every way.</P><P>The word indecency in 24:1 is significant. Indecency kills marriage. Therefore, we all must avoid every kind of indecency. God has created us male and female, and there is a big difference between male and female. In her conduct, a sister should always be mindful of the fact that she is a female. For example, a sister, whether married or single, should not talk too freely with a brother or sit too closely to a brother. Furthermore, the sisters should avoid indecency in the matter of dress, not clothing themselves in an indecent manner. The purpose of clothing is not primarily to protect us from the cold but to cover our nakedness. As God's people, we should be a testimony to Him even in the way we clothe ourselves. If the sisters avoid indecency, they will preserve themselves and maintain their status as females. For the sake of a proper married life, we must avoid all indecency.</P>
