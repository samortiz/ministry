   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the believer loses the feeling of happiness, he thinks that everything is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the Lord's presence cannot be felt, he thinks that the Lord must not be with him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the Lord's warmth cannot be felt, he thinks that the Lord must not be pleased with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After a while, he does not even seem to know where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he is not disheartened at this point, he will intently seek to recover what he has lost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though he loves his Lord and desires to be near Him very much, he does not have any feeling of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can he bear this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the believer does not fall back out of discouragement, he will press on to seek God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in spite of his strenuous struggles, he is unable to free himself from the feeling of dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Good behavior at this time is a strain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In his heart he secretly rebukes himself for being hypocritical and for putting on a good front despite his inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This pretentious effort does not succeed; it always leads to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These failures only serve to increase the believer's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If someone praises him, he feels quite shameful because others do not realize the great darkness he feels in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If someone rebukes him, he feels that it is justified because he knows his own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he sees how other believers are growing and how they have sweet fellowship with the Lord, he is very desirous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He feels that all the people around him are somewhat virtuous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has nothing, and everyone else seems stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Will this condition of dryness persist?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or will the believer regain his previous experience?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will, after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a few weeks, the feeling which he lost may suddenly come back.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This may happen after he has heard someone preach the word, or after he has fervently prayed; it may happen while he is reading the Bible early in the morning or while he is awake and thinking about the Lord in the middle of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The time varies, but the happiness does come back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this time, the condition that was lost is altogether restored.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's presence is just as sweet, the love in his heart is just as burning, praying and reading the Bible are just as enjoyable, and the Lord Himself is just as desirable, approachable, and touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a burden to draw near to the Lord; rather, it once again becomes the desire of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no more darkness, suffering, and dryness, but light, happiness, and refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The believer, thinking that the Lord forsook him because of his unfaithfulness, after regaining the Lord, thinks that he must diligently keep what he has, so that he will not lose the experience of the life of feeling again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>More than ever before, he becomes cautious of his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Daily he serves the Lord with the best of his ability in hope of maintaining his happiness and never failing again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though he is so faithful and diligent, the Lord surprisingly leaves him again after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His feeling of happiness disappears again, and he sinks back into a state of suffering, darkness, and dryness once more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we examine the history of a believer, we will realize that after a person has been freed from sin and is in touch with the person of God, he frequently has this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning the Lord causes him to feel His love, presence, and happiness, but this feeling disappears after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When it comes back, the believer recovers his joy once more, but then it goes away again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Generally, the believer will experience this several times in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of experience may not happen to a believer who is still fleshly and has not yet learned to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when a believer has made some progress and has learned to love the Lord will he experience this.</S>
