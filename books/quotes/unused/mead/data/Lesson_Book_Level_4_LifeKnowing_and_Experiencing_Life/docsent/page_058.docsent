   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE POSITION OF THE FLESH BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the position of the flesh before God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is God's attitude toward the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This matter is clearly mentioned in many places in the Bible; however, we can only point out here the most important passages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. God Cannot Mingle with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 30:31-32: "Upon the flesh of man shall it the holy anointing oil not be poured.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The holy anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the declaration that the holy anointing oil must not be poured upon man's flesh means that God cannot mingle or unite with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. God and the Flesh Cannot Exist Together</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Exodus 17:14, 16: "Jehovah said unto Moses I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven Jehovah has sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Israelites as the descendants of Jacob typify the chosen, regenerated part within us, that is the new man in our spirit belonging to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Amalekites as the descendants of Esau typify the fallen natural part within us, that is the old man in the flesh belonging to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Esau and Jacob were twins, but their descendants, the Amalekites and the Israelites, were mutual enemies; they could not stand together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, our fleshly old man is very close to our spiritual new man; the two are also mutual enemies and cannot stand together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that God would have war with Amalek shows us how God hates the flesh and desires to exterminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the flesh is not exterminated and there is no dealing with it, our spiritual life will have no way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two can never compromise or co-exist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. God is Determined to Remove the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament God did one specific thing to express His attitude toward the flesh He established circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first man whom God commanded to perform the act of circumcision was Abraham Gen 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God promised Abraham that his descendants would be as the stars in the heavens and as the sands of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as God delayed in the fulfillment of His promise, Abraham took Hagar as his wife and bore Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, he used the strength of his flesh to fulfill God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was not pleased with him, and for thirteen years God hid Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, when Abraham was ninety-nine years old, God appeared again to him Gen 16:15; 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this appearance God commanded Abraham and all that belonged to him to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means God desired that the flesh be removed so that henceforth they would not serve God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. The Bible's Conclusion of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:8: "They that are in the flesh cannot please God.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible has spoken much about the flesh, and at this point it concludes that the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If man belongs to the flesh, minds the flesh, and lives by the flesh, whatever he does, either good or bad, cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you want to please God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do, you must live in the spirit and deal with the flesh.</S>
