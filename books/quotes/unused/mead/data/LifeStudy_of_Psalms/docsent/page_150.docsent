   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE PSALMISTS' INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE AND CITY THROUGH THE SUFFERING, EXALTED, AND REIGNING CHRIST 1 THE PSALMISTS PANTING AFTER GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 42 44</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Psalms are composed of five books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far in our fellowship, we have covered Book One of the Psalms, composed of the first forty-one psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will begin our fellowship on Book Two of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this book we see the psalmists' intensified enjoyment of God in His house and city through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The psalms in Book One were written mainly by David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Book Two, however, contains eight psalms that were composed by the sons of Korah, Psalms 42 49.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>David is a glorious name among the nation of Israel, but Korah is an infamous name because Korah rebelled against Moses and God Num 16:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In spite of this, some of the descendants of Korah became composers of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that among the five books of the Psalms, the revelation is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The five books of the Psalms are not on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Psalms is like a stairway with five steps, that takes us higher in its revelation in a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Book Two of the Psalms begins in Psalm 42:1 in a very good way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The psalmist said, "As the hart pants/After the streams of water,/So my soul pants/For You, O God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can sense the Lord's freshness in the desire and aspiration of the psalmist here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is much different from what is expressed by the psalmist in Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human concept of Psalm 1 is that the man who delights in the law of God prospers in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The psalmist said that the one who delighted and meditated in the law would be like a tree transplanted beside streams of water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A tree drinks water by absorbing it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Psalm 42, however, the psalmist said that his soul panted for God, just as the hart pants after the streams of water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then he said, "My soul thirsts for God,/For the living God./When will I come and appear/Before God?" v. 2 . Psalm 1, the opening word of Book One, begins with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Book Two begins with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What do we prefer the law or God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do we want to be like a tree transplanted by the streams of water by delighting in the law or like a hart panting after God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely there is no comparison between God and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows us that Book Two of the Psalms is higher than Book One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we have to realize that the psalms progressively become higher in their revelation from Book One through Book Five.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Book Five is the high peak of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The high peak of this book is expressed in the word Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah means praise Jehovah, praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, Book Two begins with God, and Book Five ends with "Praise God."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we get into the New Jerusalem, we will all say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some have asked me what language we will use in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not know what language we will speak, but we will probably say "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah!" all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What other things will we need to talk about by that time?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we study the book of Psalms, we should reach some points where we sing " hallelujah" spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even when we read Psalm 1 we can say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don't need to love the law anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very striking that Book Two begins with the psalmist's panting after God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Panting after God is different from worshipping God in a formal, religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is our living water for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do we need to bow down to worship the water?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to pant after this water and then drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 1 the word pants is used.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 2 the word thirsts is used.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My soul pants for God and thirsts for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I love these predicates.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to have times with the Lord in which we pant after Him and thirst for Him.</S>
