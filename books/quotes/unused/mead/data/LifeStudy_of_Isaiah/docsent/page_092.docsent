   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Adding Fifteen Years to Hezekiah's Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Hezekiah received this miraculous deliverance, he became mortally ill.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah came to him and said, "Thus says Jehovah, Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live" 38:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then Hezekiah again prayed a very godly prayer, saying, "O Jehovah, please remember how I have walked before You in truth, with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Your sight" v. 3 . God heard Hezekiah's prayer and answered it by healing him and saying, through Isaiah, that He would add fifteen years to his life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number of years added to Hezekiah's life is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Hezekiah became mortally ill, he was a middle-aged man, perhaps about forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For God to give him another fifteen years meant that he would live until the age of approximately fifty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since God was willing to heal Hezekiah, why did He not give him another thirty years and allow him to reach the age of seventy?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that the reason God extended Hezekiah's life by only fifteen years was that, in the sight of God, Hezekiah was not a person who could be trusted to carry out God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Had Hezekiah been permitted to live longer, he might have caused even more trouble to God's kingdom than he did in chapter thirty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During his last fifteen years, Hezekiah made a mistake that was so serious that it caused God's kingdom on earth to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Considerate and Careful but Hasty</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 39 shows us that instead of being a considerate and careful person, Hezekiah was hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His prayers indicated that he had a sober mind and was quite wise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, after he was healed by God, he did something foolish when visitors from Babylon came to him with a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Receiving the gift, he showed the visitors his treasury, his whole armory, and everything in his dominion v. 2 . This was a foolish act and a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The showing of these riches, which had been accumulated by his fathers since the time of David and Solomon, became a temptation to the king of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A little over one hundred years later, the king of Babylon came and took away these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hezekiah did not consider his action carefully, nor did he pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He should have been careful, knowing that Babylon was Judah's enemy and that sooner or later the Babylonian army would come to destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, Hezekiah did not take thought concerning what the king of Babylon might do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that Hezekiah was hasty and not very considerate or careful.</S>
