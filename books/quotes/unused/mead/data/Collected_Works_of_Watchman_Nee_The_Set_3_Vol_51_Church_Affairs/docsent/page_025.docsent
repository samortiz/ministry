   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWELVE ITEMS OF PRACTICAL AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many things that we can consider before the Lord: 1 the cleaning work; 2 the arranging of the hall and the work of ushering; 3 the need for a group of brothers and sisters to take care of the breaking of bread and the baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some need to be responsible for the bread and the cup for the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also need some who are trained to take care of the matters related to baptisms, such as helping those who are being baptized go down and come up out of the water, change their clothes, etc. 4 Giving to the poor among the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When unbelievers are involved in disasters of floods or fire, the church should take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 Caring for those who are poor among us; 6 the receiving and sending of brothers; 7 the bookkeeping; 8 the kitchen service; 9 the service office; 10 the transportation service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In places where cars or vans are available, some need to oversee their use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>11 The clerical work, which includes handling the incoming and outgoing mail; and 12 helping the poor brothers and sisters do their household chores, including laundry, sewing, mending, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I also expect that every brother and sister will bear the burden in practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Never let a situation exist where some have things to do and others are doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The service of the church is always for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there are some brothers and sisters in our midst who have time, it would be good for them to help other brothers and sisters in their housework.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every week they could go to another brother's or sister's house to help for an hour or two, doing some miscellaneous things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Especially, it would be good for those sisters who are housewives with wealth and good standing to go to some brother's or sister's house to do some washing and mending.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should not just have people working for them, while they themselves do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It befits them as Christians to go to the homes of poor brothers and sisters and do things with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PRINCIPLE OF EVERYONE SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have said enough concerning the practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to be clear before God about this principle that all the brothers and sisters must have spiritual service as well as practical service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not matter how much everyone can do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I expect that everyone will work and do his best.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If this matter can be properly arranged, the church will be able to progress step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers, I say again that you must realize that the responsibility upon you is very great and that the things in your hands will keep you very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to work to such an extent that you bring all the brothers to the same condition that you are in. When all the brothers come and serve together, the church in that locality will have a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When others see this, they will know the church is in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone works, everyone shares in the practical affairs, and everyone participates in the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CAUSING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO DO BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would like to speak to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have a natural habit of using only the two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The history of the church has always been like this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The five- talented ones can advance by themselves; there is no need to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as for the one-talented ones, it is really hard to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A word or two to them and they bury their talent again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two-talented ones are the most available ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have some ability, they can do things well, and they do not bury their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if you can use only the two-talented ones and cannot use the one-talented ones in every place, you have failed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have said this in Foochow, I have said this in Shanghai, and I will say it again today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is all the one-talented ones coming forth to partake of the church service on the practical side and on the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You cannot shake your head and say, "This one is useless, and that one is useless.''</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say that this one is useless and that one is useless, the church is finished and you fail completely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you think someone is useless, he will really be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You can tell him that according to himself he is indeed useless, but the Lord has given him one talent, and He wants all the one-talented ones to go out and do business.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord can use them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you cannot use the one-talented ones, it proves that before the Lord you cannot be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have to use all those brothers and sisters who are "useless.''</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the job of the brothers who are workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They must not only use the useful brothers and sisters but also make the useless brothers and sisters useful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The basic principle is that the Lord has never given less than one talent to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Lord's house there is not one servant without a gift; everyone has at least one talent and cannot have less than one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can excuse himself by saying that the Lord has not given him a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would like you to realize that all of God's children are servants before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they are children, they are servants.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, if they are members, they have a gift; if they are members, they are ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we think that there is someone whom the Lord cannot use, we do not know the grace of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must know the grace of God so thoroughly that when God calls someone His servant, we would never stand up to say that he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today if you did the choosing, perhaps you would pick only three or four persons from the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But God says that all are servants.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since God says this, we must let them serve.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, from now on whether or not we have a way in our work and whether or not the way will succeed depend upon what we can say about our work before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are there only some who are working?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are only some specially gifted ones doing the work?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Or do all the Lord's servants participate in the service, and is the whole church serving?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the entire problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If this problem cannot be solved, we have nothing.</S>
