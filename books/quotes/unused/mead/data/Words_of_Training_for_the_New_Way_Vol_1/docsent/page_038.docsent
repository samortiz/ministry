   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING THE LORD S WORD WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND FLOWING OUT RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this morning s training meeting, I would like to fellowship these matters with you clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You need to realize that the genuine Christian meeting according to God s New Testament economy is one where every believer uses the spirit to speak the Lord s word as soon as he arrives at the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say that this matter has been tested successfully in our training laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we must carry out this matter among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This requires that all of us be diligent to lead them and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, who is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter six, verse 63, continues to say that the word the Lord speaks to us is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Word is God, and the Word is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then 7:38 says that once we believe in the Lord, we receive the Spirit; the result is that there are rivers of living water flowing out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rivers of living water are the Lord s words that are flowing out unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three portions of the Scriptures show us that the Triune God as the Word becomes the Spirit to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we speak the Lord s word with the Spirit, He will flow out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, since the Triune God is the Word, Romans 10:8 says that this word is near us, in our mouth and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very weighty and real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, our realization is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We still think that God is great, holy, and lofty; how could He be with us in such a simple way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, to us the Triune God is just like air, being with us in every place at every time, although we are not conscious of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very miraculous, yet very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For God to be with us is extremely simple; He is in our mouth and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since this is a fact, then we should be filled in spirit with the Triune God, as recorded in Ephesians 5:18, so that out from within us can flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How do these rivers of living water flow out?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is through the speaking to one another as mentioned in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With what should we speak to one another?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the years many experienced ones among us have spent a lot of effort to compile many psalms and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are printed in our hymnal and are ready to be used, without the need at any time for us to compile or to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, Hymns, #501, says:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O glorious Christ, Savior mine,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thou art truly radiance divine;</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God infinite, in eternity,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet man in time, finite to be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ, expression of God, the Great,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God mingled with humanity</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lives in me my all to be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can see that these words are so brief, yet to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can say that every word is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>None of us is able to utter such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, now we only need to open up the hymnal to speak and read to one another just like the way we use the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way through our speaking with the spirit, the Triune God who fills us within will flow out like rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have already pointed out that Ephesians 5:18-19 and Colossians 3:16 are sister portions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians speaks concerning being filled with the Spirit, and Colossians speaks concerning being filled with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When these portions of Scripture are put together, they prove to us that our speaking the Lord s word with the spirit is to flow out the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, every one of us, especially the trainees, from now on should have much practice to speak the Lord s word with the spirit just as we would practice calligraphy or piano.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once you enter into the meeting, regardless of whether it is a home meeting, a small group meeting, or a large meeting, you need to open your mouth and speak the Lord s word with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a brother comes to the meeting, suppose he opens his mouth and says, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Another sister may follow and say, In the beginning, in the beginning, was the Word...</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no need to have a person find a particular topic to speak to the others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every portion of the Scripture is usable because all Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every chapter is the Lord s word; every verse is life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Someone may select Matthew 1:1, saying, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every one should be living, and every one should speak the Lord s word in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From now on, we all need to exercise to speak the Lord s word with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may use the Bible to speak, or we may use a hymn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not too difficult to do this well, as long as everyone is willing to practice sincerely.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we may feel the need to learn some truths; then we may use the Life Lessons or the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But there should not be one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is necessary for every one to practice releasing the spirit, speaking the Lord s word to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You need to realize that after we have changed the system, our responsibility will be very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It will still be necessary for the main part of the brothers and sisters of every meeting hall and district to take the lead to speak the Lord s word with the Spirit, and also to do their best to lead others to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, our meetings will become living and will be able to entirely replace the meetings of one person speaking with the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 20, 1987.</S>
