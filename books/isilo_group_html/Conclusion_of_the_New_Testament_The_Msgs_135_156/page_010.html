Romans 8:10 says that our spirit is life because of righteousness, and verse 6 tells us that the mind set on the spirit is life. Furthermore, if the Spirit dwells in us, making His home in us, God the Father will give life to our mortal bodies. When we put together verses 10, 6, and 11, we see that not only is our spirit life and our mind life if it is set on the spirit, but life may also be given to our mortal bodies by God the Father through the indwelling Spirit. First, our spirit becomes life through regeneration. Then if we are faithful to set our mind on our spirit, our mind also will become life. This will open the way for God through the Spirit to give life to our mortal bodies. This indicates that our entire tripartite being can become life or receive the supply of the divine life.<p>Those who are experienced in the Lord care much more for the Father&#8217;s giving life to their mortal bodies than for so-called miraculous healing. They pay their full attention to the matter of the inner life supply. Such believers are deep and care for the inward working of the loving Father. Spontaneously, the Father imparts the divine life through His indwelling Spirit into their weak, mortal bodies. This is not a matter of outward, miraculous healing; it is a matter of the inward strengthening in life to swallow up the death factor, the death element, in a believer&#8217;s body. The imparting of life to our mortal bodies is part of the Father&#8217;s finer and deeper work in the believers.<h2 class=head4>(16) Revealing to Them through the Spirit What He Has Prepared for Them- the Deep Things concerning Christ</h2><p>As the Father operates in the believers, sanctifying them and imparting life to them, He reveals to them through the Spirit what He has prepared for them-the deep things concerning Christ for their experience. Paul refers to these things in 1 Corinthians 2:9, where he says, &#8220;Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man&#8217;s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.&#8221; Here we see that to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To love God means to set our entire being-spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)-absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God. It is thus we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God.<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:10 Paul, referring to these deep and hidden things, says, &#8220;God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&#8221; God reveals the deep and hidden things to us through the Spirit, for these things have not been seen by man&#8217;s eyes, heard by man&#8217;s ears, nor have they come up in man&#8217;s heart. This means that man has no idea concerning them, no thought of them. They are altogether mysterious, hidden in God, and beyond human understanding. But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit, who searches all things, even the depths of God. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion.<p>First Corinthians 2:10 says that the Spirit searches all things. The Greek word translated &#8220;searches&#8221; includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.<p>The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. Therefore, to know the depths of God is to know Christ as our portion. Christ is the center of God&#8217;s economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God. Through the Spirit, God the Father reveals to us the deep things concerning Christ.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 135-156) &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
