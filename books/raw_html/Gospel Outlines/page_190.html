<h1 class="title">A NEW AND LIVING WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 10:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The path of man&rsquo;s living
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The path of man&rsquo;s living is a path that is far away from God.</li>
	<li>This path is a path of committing sins.</li>
	<li>This path is also a path of going into death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sins and died for man.</li>
	<li>The Lord resurrected and imparted His life into man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A new and living way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s saving way is a way God has prepared for man. This way is through the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, the shedding of His blood, and through His resurrection. This way enables man to come near to God.</li>
	<li>This way was never open before, so it is a new way; and this way is in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, so it is also a living way.</li>
	<li>This way does not have the hindrance of sin; rather, it has the power of life, drawing us close to God.</li>
	<li>This way not only brings man near to God, but also allows man to be one with God. Not only can man enjoy all the blessings that God bestows upon him, but he can also enjoy God Himself.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to partake of this way<br />
