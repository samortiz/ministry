<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>The faith of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="5">
	<li>The definition of faith:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for&mdash;Heb. 11:1a.</li>
		<li>The conviction of things not seen&mdash;Heb. 11:1b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The source of faith:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith comes out of the hearing of the word&mdash; Rom. 10:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The written word of God&mdash;the Bible&mdash;John 10:35.</li>
			<li>The living word of God&mdash;Christ&mdash;John 1:1.</li>
			<li>The applied word of God&mdash;the Spirit&mdash;Eph. 6:17; John 6:63.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>All the three refer to God Himself (who calls the things not being as being and gives life to the dead&mdash;Rom. 4:17) embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit, so the faith is the faith of Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom. 3:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The effect of faith&mdash;nothing will be impossible to faith&mdash;Matt. 17:20b.</li>
	<li>The believers are the believing ones in Christ who are the household of faith&mdash;Gal. 6:10.</li>
	<li>The believers&rsquo; faith in Christ brings them into the life union with Christ&mdash;John 3:15, 36.</li>
	</ol></li>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have gathered us again into Your dear name. Lord, we want to be here in Your name. In this name we have Your presence. In this name we enjoy You as the life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit. Lord, even in this gathering we have Your word, Your living word. And we thank You that You cleanse us all the time with Your precious blood. We trust in this cleansing that we might be kept in the fellowship with You, dear Lord&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Lord, give us the utterance. We do not want to be anything in this speaking, but we want to let You be everything. You are the One speaking. We are not. Even, Lord, in the listening, we need You. You are our Listener, and we are not. You replace us. We come to You, Lord. We believe that You as God are, and we are not. Thank You, Lord.</p>
