	 <h2 class="head2">The Origin of the Universe</h2>
<p>The vastness of the universe is a strong argument for the existence of God. Another strong argument relates to the origin of the universe. If there is no God, how did the universe come into existence? Those who say that there is no God can only say that the universe came into being naturally, but this is a weak and irresponsible argument. Clearly, the source of the universe is God. Rather than admitting this, they can only say, &ldquo;It came into being naturally.&rdquo; It is easy to rebut the point that the universe originated apart from God, because Romans 1:19 and 20 speak of the invisible things of God being manifested within man and to man, and that these invisible things are perceived by the things made. The very fact that some people deny the existence of God when they speak of the creation of the universe shows that there is an understanding deep within them that the universe manifests the invisible things of God. If God does not exist, there would be no need to deny His existence when looking at the things of the universe, because there would be no perception within people that these things come from God. Please look at the universe, and consider all the wonderful details of its astronomical arrangements and physical laws. Those who study astronomy and physics know that there is much that is unknown about the universe despite numerous observations and theorems. It is truly pitiful and ignorant to try to argue against the existence of God by saying, &ldquo;The universe came into being naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was in Tsingtao twenty-three years ago, and a cook in one of the hotels told me a story about a relative who came to visit him from her home in a rural area. When she saw an electric lamp for the first time, she was amazed, and she even asked the cook to give her a light bulb so that she could use it in her home in the country. She thought that the light and the light bulb &ldquo;came into being naturally,&rdquo; but she had no idea about the many complicated matters that made electric light possible.</p>
<p>D. L. Moody once climbed a mountain with a young man who did not believe in God. Moody asked him, &ldquo;Where did these big rocks come from?&rdquo; The young man answered, &ldquo;From small rocks.&rdquo; Moody then asked, &ldquo;Where did the small rocks come from?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;From atoms?&rdquo; When Moody asked him where atoms came from, the young man could not answer. The most he could say was that they &ldquo;came into being naturally.&rdquo; People who say it is superstitious to believe that God created the universe are truly superstitious when they say that all things came into being naturally.</p>
<p>A young student once asked a pastor about the origin of the earth, and the pastor spoke of the account in Genesis. When the student said that this account was mere superstition, the pastor asked, &ldquo;Then how did the earth come into existence?&rdquo; When the student said that the earth was formed from a nebulous cluster, the pastor asked him about the origin of the nebulous cluster. In response the student could only say that it came into being naturally. Then the pastor asked, &ldquo;Who is being superstitious, you or me?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Orderly Operation of the Universe</h2>
<p>When we see the orderly operation of the universe, how can we say that there is not a sovereign Lord? When country people see a train, they may think that trains move naturally, because they know little about the many mechanisms involved in the operation of a train. Some may laugh at their simple-mindedness, but those who say that there is no God, who have little understanding of the operation of the universe, are just like these country people. There are differences that we do not understand between morning and night and between the four seasons in a year, and there are even changes in weather conditions. Nevertheless, these differences and changes are truly wonderful! When we see these things, who has the boldness to arbitrarily say that there is no God? The vastness of the universe and the marvels and order of all things in the universe are strong arguments for the existence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Structure of the Human Body</h2>
<p>Even the structure of our body argues for the existence of God. All doctors know that the human body is structured in a wonderful way. For example, if our nostrils were pointed up or our eyebrows were underneath our eyes, what would happen? The direction of our nose and the placement of our eyebrows speak of the wonder of man&rsquo;s creation. Every organ operates according to its own profound principles. A doctor once told me that the hairs on our body grow downward, but that the hairs in our trachea grow upward. He said that these hairs help keep unhealthy things from entering into our body and help eliminate unhealthy things from our body.</p>
<p>Once I talked with some doctors who worked in a hospital about the wonders of the human body. Although some of them despised preachers, they were not willing to deny the existence of God, because of their specialized knowledge of the wonderful structure of the human body. Doctors who dissect dead bodies for research truly know that the human body is designed in a wonderful way. The circulation of blood, for example, supplies all the organs of our body, and it also facilitates the elimination of harmful things from our body. The circulation of blood helps to keep a body healthy and free from sicknesses. This is truly fascinating!</p>
<p>Things in general can be modified, but the structure of the human body needs no modification. If it were modified, it would create problems and look unpleasant. If our hands were in the position of our legs, and our legs were connected to our shoulders, this would look quite terrifying. God&rsquo;s creation is perfect, and there is no need for modification. Even a minor modification would result in an imperfection.</p>
