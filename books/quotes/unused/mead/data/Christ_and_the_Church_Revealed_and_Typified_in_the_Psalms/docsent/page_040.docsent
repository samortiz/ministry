   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN CHRIST'S ATTAINMENT IN HIS ASCENSION FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD'S HOUSE Psalm 68 Scripture Reading: Psa 68:1, 4-6, 9-13, 15-32, 35</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was a young Christian, I was always afraid to come to this Psalm, because I simply could not comprehend its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately after I was saved, I was encouraged to memorize Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was very easy for me to understand this one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a number of years in the Word of God, I learned to summarize passages and divide the Word into paragraphs and sections.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That came easily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when I encountered Psalm 68, I could not summarize it, neither could I divide it into sections.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of the time I passed over it and neglected it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was too difficult for me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, though I neglected it, the Lord could not forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord, now we are in Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have always been so happy in recent months to stay in this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am not afraid of it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I love Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would testify that today I am on top of this Psalm, I am on the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will see that in this Psalm we have firstly Christ, secondly the house, thirdly the city, Jerusalem, and fourthly the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we do not have the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law has been left behind; the law has been dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, we only have Christ in the house within the city for the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the four key words of Psalm 68 Christ, the house, the city, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would understand this Psalm, and indeed all the Psalms, we must understand these four words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The whole book of the Psalms is found in miniature in Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By now we have already laid the foundation for this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we have come to the peak, we have already glimpsed it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen Christ, we have seen the house, we have seen the city, and we have seen the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have such a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now it is easy for us to understand Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may briefly define this Psalm by saying that it tells us how, in God's move on the earth, Christ ascended to the heavens and as a man received gifts from God for the building of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The building up of God's house is for the expansion of the city, and the expansion of the city is for Christ's reigning over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ has conquered all His enemies, He has won the victory, He has led captive a train of vanquished foes, He has ascended and been exalted to the highest place in the universe, and He has received gifts for building up the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This house is for the city, and the city is for the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now you have Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without these points, though you may read this Psalm one hundred times, you will never comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we must look into these matters in further detail.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that this Psalm presents us with nine major points.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I. GOD'S MOVING ON THIS EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To properly understand Psalm 68, we must be acquainted with the background of its composition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is God's moving on this earth in His tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In ancient times God moved on this earth among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He moved with them from Egypt to the wilderness and into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His moving was not in the heavens, but on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He rode through the wilderness, through the desert, not through the skies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All God's moving at that time was related to the tabernacle, within which was the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tabernacle in typology signifies God's dwelling place, and the ark represents Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, God was moving on the earth in and through His dwelling place with Christ as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be clear concerning these three points: 1 God is moving on the earth, 2 God's move was in and with the tabernacle, and 3 God's move was with Christ as the center in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Psalm 68 was written with this background.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is an exact portrayal of the situation with God's move on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is moving on this earth, He is moving in and through His church, and He is moving with Christ as the center of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 1 says, "Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a quotation of Numbers 10:35, "And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Psalm 68:1 was the word spoken by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God set out to move with the ark, Moses said, "Rise up, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now Moses' word is quoted by David: "Let God arise."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, we see that the background of this Psalm is the move of God in His tabernacle with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The move of God on this earth is not only the background of Psalm 68, but also the first thought.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition to verse 1, there are other verses which speak most expressively of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 4 in the best translation reads, "Triumph in him that rideth through the deserts," not, as in the King James Version, "him that rideth upon the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is not riding through the skies, but through the wilderness, through the deserts of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The entire earth today is a desert, a wilderness; yet God is riding through and moving on.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not be disappointed; triumph in Him, in Him who is riding through the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The desert means nothing to Him; He is riding through it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"His name is JAH; and exult before him."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses 7 and 8 continue the thought of God's move: "O God thou wentest forth before thy people thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first point of this Psalm is that God is moving on this earth.</S>
