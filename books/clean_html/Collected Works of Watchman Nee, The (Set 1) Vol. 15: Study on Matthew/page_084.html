<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</H1><P>In order to understand Matthew 24 and 25, we must first understand the rapture. After we have understood the rapture, we still need a considerable foundation before we can understand Matthew 24 and 25. These two chapters are prophecies concerning (1) the Jews, (2) the church, and (3) the Gentiles. Besides Revelation, these two chapters are the most important prophecies in this age. Revelation covers the details, whereas Matthew covers the principle. These two chapters are most difficult to understand. Until a hundred years ago, no one paid much attention to them. It was not until 1828 that people began to study them in detail. Because of differences in background, the expositions were different. Generally speaking, there are three schools: (1) Newton maintains that both these chapters refer to the church. (2) Darby and Scofield maintain that both these chapters refer to the Jews. (3) Our attitude is that some parts refer to the Jews and some parts to the church. The reasons put forth by the three schools respectively are: (1) the disciples represent the church, (2) the disciples represent the Jews, and (3) the disciples are Jews (representing the remnant of the Jews) and also at the same time are pillars of the church.</P><P>It is most important to see the difference in the division of these two chapters; otherwise, we will be misled by the first two schools. We must read carefully, and we must read it ourselves. This is like bringing our own scales to buy our groceries; it is the only way to assure that we will not be cheated.</P><P>Let us look at the background of chapters twenty-two and twenty-three first. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord prophesied about the taking of the kingdom of God from the Jews, and in 22:21 the Lord commanded the Jews to submit to the Gentiles. In chapter twenty-three the Lord rebuked the Pharisees. In 23:38 the word "house" has the same root word as the word "buildings" in 24:1. It should have been the Father's house, but at that time it had become "your house." Here the Lord was clearly rejecting the people of Israel. This is the background.</P><P>Before the Lord there are two groups of people: (1) the rejected Jews, and (2) a nation producing its fruit (21:43). The disciples represented both the remnant of the Jews and the called ones, that is, both the Jews and the church. Thus, we should first find out which section refers to the Jews and which section to the church. Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews; whereas 24:32—25:46 refers to the church. The reason for this division is based on the internal evidence and the external evidence. The internal evidence is the text itself; the external evidence is the proof from the Epistles.</P><P>(1) Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews because these verses are all interpreted literally, whereas 24:32—25:46 must be interpreted spiritually. For example, in Matthew 24:20 the "winter" refers to the wintertime, to the hardship in escaping. The Sabbath day also should be interpreted literally. On the other hand, the "summer" in 24:32 is interpreted spiritually; it refers to the coming of the kingdom. The fig tree refers to some Israelites. Also, the reference to the "inner rooms" in 24:26 is interpreted literally, while the "house" in 24:43 is interpreted spiritually. All those verses that refer to the Jews should be interpreted literally, and all those that refer to the church should be interpreted spiritually (see Matt. 13:11-13).</P><P>(2) Before Matthew 24:31, all the verses have a Jewish background; for example, "holy place" (v. 15), "in Judea" (v. 16), and "Sabbath" (v. 20). After verse 31, everything is in the open, and there is no restriction according to location.</P><P>(3) Before Matthew 24:31 everything is material; after verse 31 everything is moral. For example, when it mentions "nations," "those who are pregnant," and "babies," all these are literal. On the other hand, the "virgins," the "slaves," the "master of those slaves," the "goats," and the "sheep" in chapter twenty-five all have moral meanings. Furthermore, there is a difference in meaning of the words "go forth" in Matthew 24:26 and "went forth" in 25:1; one is literal and the other spiritual.</P><P>(4) Before 24:31 there is no moral requirement; there is only the need to escape. After verse 31 all the requirements are moral—being watchful and being prepared are all the responsibility of the saints in the end time.</P><P>(5) False Christs—The Jews believe that another Christ will come. So before verse 31 there is the difference between the Jews and the Gentiles ("kingdom against kingdom" means the Gentiles against the Gentiles). After verse 31 there is no such distinction because the reference is to the church.</P><P>Panton also said that verse 31 is a great dividing line. In summary, Matthew 24:4-31 refers only to the Jews. Matthew 24:32—25:30 refers to the church. Matthew 25:31-46 speaks to the church concerning the things of the Gentiles (see chart).</P>
