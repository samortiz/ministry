   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink 1 Cor 10:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spiritual food is typified by the manna Exo 16:4, 14-15, 35 , and the spiritual drink is typified by the water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6; Num 20:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we have Christ as our manna, and we have the Holy Spirit out of the crucified Christ as our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To eat and drink in this way is to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By Drinking the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ is by drinking the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse says that we are one Body because we all were baptized in the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit was first the means through which we were baptized into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that we have been baptized into the Body through the one Spirit, we should continually drink the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been given by Christ to drink the one Spirit, in whom we have all been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit in whom we have been baptized and whom we are now drinking has two aspects, the outward and the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit in the outward aspect is the economical Spirit, and the Spirit in the inward aspect is the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are baptized in the economical Spirit, and we drink the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, baptism is economical, and drinking is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By Partaking of Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We enjoy the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God also by partaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must partake of Him as the life-giving Spirit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Anointing, Sealing,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Pledging of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by the anointing, sealing, and pledging of the Spirit 2 Cor 1:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anointing is horizontal, but sealing is vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing of the Spirit permeates us horizontally, and the sealing of the Spirit saturates us vertically by reaching deeply into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The pledging of the Spirit is the first taste, a sample, of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The anointing, sealing, and pledging reveal three aspects of the one Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit is on us as the anointing Spirit; He is within us as the sealing Spirit; and He is with us as the pledging Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The anointing Spirit is permeating us, the sealing Spirit is saturating us, and the pledging Spirit is the guarantee, the first taste, the sample, given to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This anointing, sealing, and pledging is the way for us to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
