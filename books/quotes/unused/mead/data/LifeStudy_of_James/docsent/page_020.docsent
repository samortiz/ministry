   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JUDGED BY THE LAW OF FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 11 James says, For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the context, this verse indicates that telling a poor brother to sit under our footstool is equal to killing him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To treat a poor brother in this way is to commit murder, for to despise a poor brother is to kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 12 continues, So speak and so do as those who are about to be judged by a law of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So both times does not refer to what has gone before, but to what follows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law of freedom here and in 1:25 refers to the same law, which is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>James 2:8-11, as also 4:11, speaks of keeping the law of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James 2:12 speaks of judgment upon the believers by the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The believers should speak and do according to the law of life, which surpasses the law of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should live according to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of living surpasses the keeping of the law of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The unbelievers will be judged by the law of letters, which is the law of Moses, at the great white throne Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers will be judged by the law of life, the law of freedom, which is the law of Christ, at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was young, I could not understand 2:11 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I knew that in the New Testament God does not want us to keep the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But here James talks about keeping the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His word corresponds to what is recorded in Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But then in verse 12 James tells us that we shall be judged by another law, by the perfect law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I understand that in the mind of James the Old Testament law and the New Testament law were mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James did not make a distinction between the Old Testament law and the New Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First James talks about keeping the law, and then he speaks about being judged by Christ according to the law of freedom, according to the law of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that James mixed these laws together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the clear revelation of the Bible, there will be three major judgments to come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first will be the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This judgment will be carried out in the air, and it will be executed upon all the raptured and resurrected believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That judgment will not be related to salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because that judgment will concern believers, the question of salvation will have been eternally settled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That judgment will determine whether the believers will receive a reward or suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s intention is first to give us salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then if we live by God s salvation, we shall receive God s reward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We receive salvation in this age, the church age, and we receive the reward in the next age, in the age of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This judgment of the believers is the first major judgment that is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second major judgment is recorded in Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This judgment will take place after the Lord comes back with the overcoming saints and destroys Antichrist and his army at Armageddon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the Lord Jesus will set up His throne of glory in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the living Gentiles will be gathered before the Lord to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Lord judges them, He will divide them into sheep and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The goats will go to the lake of fire, and the sheep will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to become the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second Timothy 4:1 says that God has appointed the Lord Jesus to judge the living and the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to Matthew 25, He will judge the living at the throne of His glory at the beginning of the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of the thousand years there will be the third major judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will be the judgment of all dead unbelievers, a judgment that will take place at the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By these three judgments the Lord will clear up the situation among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord Jesus judges the believers at His judgment seat, He will not judge them according to the law of Moses or according to His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, He will judge them according to the law of freedom, that is, according to the perfect law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 2:12 James refers to the judgment of the believers according to the law of freedom at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, James warns the believers that they will be judged by Christ according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, he charges the recipients of this Epistle to keep the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates again James lack of a clear view according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It indicates that he did not have a clear vision about the distinction between the Old Testament and New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He mixed the two dispensations together; that is, he mixed the law of the Old Testament with the law of the New Testament.</S>
