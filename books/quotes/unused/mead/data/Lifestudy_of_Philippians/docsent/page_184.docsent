   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO SOURCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, forbearance comes from God, and anxiety comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that forbearance and anxiety represent two different sources God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God, the Source of Forbearance</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source of forbearance is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God gives us forbearance so that we may accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has a purpose with us individually, with our families, and with us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to carry out God s purpose related to us, to our families, and to the church, we need forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we lack the all-inclusive virtue of forbearance, it will be impossible for us to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means it will not be possible for us to allow God to fulfill His purpose with us, with our family, and with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has a threefold purpose with every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has a purpose for us individually, a purpose for us in relation to our family, and a purpose for us in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is crucial for us to realize that God has such a threefold purpose concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the fulfillment of such a divine purpose, we need forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without forbearance we shall not allow God to fulfill His purpose with us, with our family, or with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that forbearance means to be utterly reasonable, considerate, and understanding in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are forbearing, we shall have the wisdom and the ability to supply others with what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall also have the full knowledge of what to say to them and when to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, a parent who is forbearing will know how and when to speak to his children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not exercise forbearance in our family life, we shall not be able to build up our family for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only is forbearance the totality of the proper Christian life; it is also the means given by God for the fulfillment of His threefold purpose with each of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How precious that the source of forbearance is God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The forbearance we exercise and make known to others comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan, the Source of Anxiety</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The source of anxiety is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anxiety comes from Satan to frustrate the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that God assigns anxiety to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the foregoing message I said that anxiety comes from the circumstances assigned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that anxiety comes from God s assignment is quite different from saying that anxiety is God s assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the fall, God has assigned sufferings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, God has ordained that women experience suffering in childbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also ordained that men cope with thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 3:17-19, say, Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee...in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although God has assigned such sufferings, He has not assigned anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After God made His assignment, Satan came in to cause anxiety through the sufferings assigned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anxiety does not come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It comes from God s adversary, Satan, who uses the sufferings ordained by God to cause anxiety in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, anxiety comes from Satan and represents Satan, whereas forbearance comes from God and represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How God Uses Satan</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible reveals that God uses Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We see this especially in the book of Job When I first read this book, I was troubled by the fact that Satan had access to God s presence in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Job 1:6 says, Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next verses record a conversation between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I wondered how this conversation could take place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why would God allow such an evil one to talk with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why did He not destroy Satan, or at least drive him away?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God used Satan to deal with Job Job was righteous and perfect in himself; however, he did not truly know God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, Job needed to be broken, to be dealt with thoroughly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God used Satan to accomplish this work, allowing Satan, within certain prescribed limits, to do certain things to Job</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From 2 Corinthians 12 we see that God also permitted a messenger from Satan to afflict Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul realized that his thorn in the flesh came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He says, And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure v. 7 . The principle is the same both in the case of Paul and of Job Just as Satan was permitted by God to afflict Paul, he was allowed to afflict Job</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the first chapter of the book of Job, soon after Satan received permission to afflict Job, he sent calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, a report came that the Sabeans had stolen the oxen and the asses and slain the servants Job 1:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Immediately the report came of another calamity: fire had fallen from heaven and had consumed Job s sheep and other of his servants.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the report came about the Chaldeans who stole the camels and slew still other servants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the news came of the fourth calamity: a great wind from the wilderness destroyed the house where Job s sons and daughters were feasting, and they all were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we see that Satan is able to use people, fire, and wind to bring in great destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I first read Job 1, I did not understand why God allowed Satan to do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First Satan sends the calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then he comes to cause anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God had a purpose in permitting Satan to afflict Job God s purpose was to break Job, who was a perfect and self-righteous person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God used Satan to do what no human being was able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since Job s friends could not deal with him, God used Satan for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Often the Devil accomplishes certain difficult assignments for God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes if God cannot get through by using other people, He will permit Satan to deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Concerning Job, God s purpose was to break him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning Paul, God s purpose in allowing Satan to send a messenger to afflict his body was to keep him from being proud because of the visions and revelations he received.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No doubt, Satan s purpose is always to attack God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This purpose is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But in permitting a satanic attack to take place, God has another purpose, a very positive one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the sufferings we undergo are assigned to us by God for a positive purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul speaks of this purpose in 2 Corinthians 4:16 and 17: For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is being consumed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For the momentary lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory lit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>. Although the afflictions are assigned by God, they do not come from Him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, every affliction, disaster, calamity, or catastrophe comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But they come with God s permission and for His purpose to perfect us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was the reason Paul could declare that the present lightness of affliction works for us an exceeding weight of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has a purpose to fulfill concerning us, and this purpose sometimes requires Satan s help.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A few months ago I had a problem with my health.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I knew this problem was caused by the Devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But I also realized that it was permitted by God for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord wanted to touch something in me, and He used this means to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we look at the cases of Job and Paul, we shall see that God permits Satan to cause affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As soon as the affliction comes, Satan comes to cause anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The anxiety caused by Satan is for the frustration of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To repeat, forbearance comes from God for the fulfillment of His purpose, but anxiety comes from Satan for the frustration of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we see this, we shall realize that it is not an insignificant matter for Paul to speak of forbearance and anxiety together in Philippians 4:5 and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>NO COEXISTENCE</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>OF FORBEARANCE AND ANXIETY</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we have forbearance, we shall not have anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But if we have anxiety, we shall not have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Just as God and Satan cannot stand together, so forbearance and anxiety cannot coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whenever forbearance comes, anxiety must go.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But if anxiety is with us, we shall be utterly lacking in forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>No one who exercises forbearance can be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But if you are not a forbearing person, you will be anxious and filled with worry.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>From experience, not from doctrine, we have come to understand that when we exercise forbearance in full, all anxiety disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If by God s mercy and grace we forbear with everyone, everything, and every matter, we shall not be anxious in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By God s mercy and grace we need to forbear with persons, things, and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are forbearing in this way, we shall not be subject to anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>LIVING CHRIST AS OUR FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have seen that forbearance is actually Christ Himself lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Christ in Philippians 1, 2, and 3 is the very forbearance Paul speaks of in 4:5.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Thus, to make our forbearance known is to make our Christ known.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Forbearance is actually the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In 1:20 Paul says that Christ will be magnified in him, but in 4:5 he tells us to let our forbearance be known.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we put these verses together, we see that to let our Christ be magnified is to let our forbearance be known.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Therefore, in our experience forbearance is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we live Christ as our forbearance, it will not be possible for us to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Anxiety is an impossibility for those who have Christ as their forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Do you know why we are anxious and why we worry?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We are anxious and worried because we do not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The words live Christ may merely be a doctrinal term, a way of speaking, not our actual living in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But when we live Christ day by day, anxiety has no ground within us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I repeat, to forbear is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In such a life, a life of forbearing everything by the grace of God, there is no room for anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When we magnify Christ by living Him, anxiety has no way to touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then because we live Christ as our forbearance, we shall be anxious for nothing.</S>
