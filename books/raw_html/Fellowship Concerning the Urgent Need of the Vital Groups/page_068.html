 <h1 class="title">HOW TO PRODUCE AND ESTABLISH<br />
A VITAL GROUP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>By one saint to be made vital&mdash;living and active:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the absolute, clear, and thorough fellowship with the Lord continuously.</li>
	<li>Through the thorough confession of sins, transgressions, failures, defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, etc., hidden or manifested, before God and before men.</li>
	<li>Through the absolute and thorough consecration of oneself with everything to the Lord.</li>
	<li>Through the unceasing and desperate prayer.</li>
	<li>Through the soaking of the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By contacting another seeking saint:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To fellowship with him or her according to the above procedures.</li>
	<li>To make him or her vital and join with you as a group.</li>
	<li>Both of you continuing to contact other seeking saints and making them vital to join with you and to increase your group.</li>
	<li>Until your group reaches about ten, dividing it into two groups, and instructing each of the two groups to do the same thing as you have done with them.</li>
	</ol></li>
