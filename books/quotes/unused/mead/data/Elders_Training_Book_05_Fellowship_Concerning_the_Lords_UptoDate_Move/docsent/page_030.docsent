   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MIRACULOUS THINGS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE KINDERGARTEN STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND DISTRACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GOD S MAIN WORK</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO PRODUCE THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The miracles, including tongue-speaking do not belong to the word of righteousness but are listed with the good word of God, the word of the beginning of the Christ, which is in the kindergarten stage of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s burden in the book of Hebrews was to bring the believers out of the kindergarten stage and to bring them on to maturity, to the word of righteousness concerning Christ s heavenly ministry, concerning the way of His economy, which is the solid food for them to reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament age God s main work is to bring forth the new creation, and the new creation work is based upon regeneration in our spirit by God s divine life, not by any miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time of regeneration, God continues to renew us, to sanctify us dispositionally, to transform us from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, and eventually to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God unto glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the main work of God in the New Testament age to create His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Especially at the initial stage of the New Testament in the Acts, God used miracles but these miracles including speaking in tongues, are absolutely related to the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, the miraculous things would be easily accepted by people and would easily attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once people get attracted to the miraculous things, it is hard for you to get them away from them and to bring them to the enjoyment of Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Medical doctors to some extent prescribe morphine for certain diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is very effective, but it must be prescribed in a limited, restricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you use it without any limitation, you will get addicted and this addiction will eventually kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Morphine is good but it should not be taken as food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this sense, the miraculous things can also become addicting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been observing the so-called miraculous things for close to sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once one gets this kind of so-called experience of the miracles or of tongue-speaking, there is a strong tendency for them to become addicted to it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This addiction always frustrates them from going on in the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am so strong against the overemphasis of the miraculous things because I know the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The miraculous things are not only a real attraction but also a distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once you get addicted to morphine, you will always come to it again and again even though you know it is not so healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should weigh everything against the truth concerning the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The miraculous things can distract people from God s main work to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God produces the new creation by regenerating the fallen and dead creation with His own divine life in the very spirit of the fallen and dead people, whom He chose in eternity past, to make them a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is accomplished by Himself as the divine life, as the Spirit, entering into His chosen peoples spirit to regenerate them, to sanctify them, to transform them, and to conform them unto glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This has nothing to do with miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these miraculous things, including speaking in tongues, belong to the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MIRACULOUS THINGS IMITATED BY THE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>UNBELIEVERS AND PERFORMED BY THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been documented that the Mormons, in their early days, practiced all the miracles, including tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It has also been documented that not only the Mormons practiced tongue-speaking but also the ancient Egyptians spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, tongue-speaking was a Gentile phenomenon in the ancient Han dynasty of China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A brother among us from Ghana told us that he saw tongue-speaking by the pagan priests and priestesses in their idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During their religious festivities, some kind of ecstasy would come upon the priests and priestesses and at some point they would speak in something other than the language they spoke in Ghana.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They would speak something and this would be interpreted in a way of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The townspeople would try to check out which of the priests and priestesses were false and which ones were not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were times when what they prophesied came true.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they spoke something that did not happen, however, everybody would mock them for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this brother from Ghana was saved and saw Christians doing similar things, that was quite a surprise to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows that the miraculous things can be performed by the enemy 2 Thes 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At least the people in this village in Ghana checked out the prophecy to see whether or not it would come true.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many in Pentecostalism, however, prophesy falsely and are never exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the works of power miracles , including tongue-speaking, can be imitated by unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the matter of regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification by God as the Spirit with His divine life in our spirit eventually saturating our entire body could never be imitated by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Karl Marx invented communism by picking up the word in Acts 2:44 concerning having everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Communists are attempting to practice having everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through the centuries some groups of Christians always tried their best to imitate these miraculous things such as practicing having everything in common, healings, tongue-speaking, and other miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These things can be taken and imitated by people in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, God s full salvation which issues in God s new creation and begins from regeneration, passing through sanctification, transformation, conformation, and reaching glorification can never be imitated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>TREASURING THE DIVINE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>FOR THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope that by His mercy all of us have seen something concerning the truth of dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Miracles are not designed by our God for this age but for the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet in this age, there is sometimes the need of miraculous things to prove that what God does in this age is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What He is doing in this age, however, is altogether not in the physical realm but in the realm of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The majority of the New Testament writings are for God s work in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only a small percentage of the New Testament refers to God s work in the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever God works in the physical realm is a miracle, but whatever God does in our spirit, in the realm of our spirit, is not miraculous but divine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We treasure the divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not care much for the miraculous work because that work does not belong to us in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That belongs to God s restoration work in the coming age.</S>
