   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FOURTH STEP OF THE FALL A. The Cause</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two factors in each step of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first factor is Satan, and the second is man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Instigation of Satan</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the flood there was no human government.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was only after the flood that God established a deputy authority on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man began to exercise God s authority to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the fourth step of the fall, Satan utilized the authority which God gave man to form the nations and to instigate a rebellion against God with the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, man fell into an open rebellion against God collectively.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Rebellion of the Human Race</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rebellion is the denial of right and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the rebellion at Babel, man declared that he denied God s right and that he was absolutely free from God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire human race was stirred up, having been instigated into rebellion, to declare that they did not care for God s right or for God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At his fall in the beginning, Satan s intention was to overthrow God s authority, but he was not successful in his attempt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, he came again into the fallen human race to inject the same thought into man, inciting man to rise up collectively against God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. The Process</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first step was the conspiracy to rebel against God Gen 11:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The created men who were under God s ruling came together to conspire to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second step was the making of bricks with the earth by human labor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God s building has never been with any kind of bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s building is with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man built the tower of Babel with bricks instead of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that man uses the misused earth plus human labor to replace God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third step was the building of a city to have a man-made, godless life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A city is the center of human living; hence, it represents human living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The city built with bricks signifies a man-made human life, which is a godless life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fourth step was the building of a tower to declare the renouncing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tower of Babel was a mark and an announcement of the city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It declared that the people there lived a life rejecting God and His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The final step was that they made a name to deny God s name, that is, to deny God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. The Result</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, God came in to scatter them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since they rebelled against God collectively, God came in to scatter them that they might no longer live together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, God confounded their language so that they were no longer able to have the same language.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Third, confusion was brought in. Babel means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is due to the curse and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When man reached the fourth step of the fall, he had fallen to the uttermost, so that even God could not do anything to recover the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, God was forced to give up the race of Adam and had to call Abraham as the head of a new race for the fulfilling of His purpose in man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The man created by God was very good and without sin, but he was deceived by God s enemy, the Devil, to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; thus, he fell and became a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, he had sinned before God, and on the other hand, he now had the sinful nature, Satan s evil nature, within him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fallen nature of man caused his descendants to fall again and again until they reached the point of rebelling against God and standing against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At this stage, man was utterly fallen and met with God s rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>QUESTIONS What were the cause and the result of the first step of man s fall?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What were the cause and the result of the second step of man s fall?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What were the cause and the result of the third step of man s fall?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What were the cause and the result of the fourth step of man s fall?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When did sin enter into man?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Explain with the Old Testament facts and the New Testament verses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When was man condemned by God?</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What was the way of salvation provided by God for man?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How was human culture developed?</S>
