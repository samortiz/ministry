   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING SAVED IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life is regulating us in a gentle way, dispensing the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result, we will be saved in the life of Christ Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the book of Romans, we are saved from at least six negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Freed from the Law of Sin and Death</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, this law in us saves us bit by bit from the law of sin and death Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our flesh there is a negative law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This law causes us to be weak, powerless, and sick, and even to die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This law also causes us to be weakened morally and to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, we become powerless in doing good and become insensitive to doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, the spontaneous operation of the law of the Spirit of life in my spirit has freed me in everything so that I am delivered from Satan's law of sin and death that dwells in my fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Saved from the Body of This Death</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, the law of the Spirit of life saves us from the body of this death Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our fallen body is called the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is also called the body of this death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The body of sin is strong with respect to sinning and transgressing against God, but the body of this death is weak with respect to doing things pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sin lends strength to the fallen body to commit sin, but death causes the corrupted body to be fully weakened and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, whatever we do becomes dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even Paul exclaimed at one point: "Who will deliver me from the body of this death?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The answer is in the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This law will not only save us from the law of sin and death, but will also save us from the body of this death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Saved from the Mortality of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, this law of the Spirit of life will save us from the mortality of the body Rom 8:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to man's fall, sin with death entered into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, there is mortality with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever we do and however we do it, the mortal body always brings death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we go along with the law of the Spirit of life, spontaneously we will be saved from the mortality of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Saved from Being Common</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fourth, the law of the Spirit of life saves us from being common Rom 6:19, 22; 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In every fallen being, there is a love within his nature for worldliness and for being common.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can never overcome this by our own struggling or striving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only by living according to the law of the Spirit of life can we be saved gradually from everything common and from the worldly thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe more or less you have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more you fellowship with the Lord, the more your view, taste, and attraction for the common things will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Saved from a Low Manner of Living</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fifth, the law of the Spirit of life saves us from a low manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 12:9-21 shows us a high standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no hatred, only love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no complaint, only giving.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is even the love of one's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A low manner of living is one that is jealous of others, that has no love, that remembers only others' shortcomings, and that does not forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The law of sin and death causes us to sin, to love the world, to be common, to be defiled, and to be powerless in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The result is that we live a low manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the law of the Spirit of life in us is annulling the law of sin and death, sanctifying us, and saving us from a low manner of living to a high standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Saved from Division</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Finally, the law of the Spirit of life saves us from all kinds of division Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christianity, conflict of human opinions always results in different groups and the establishment of sects.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is division.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if we would allow the law of the Spirit of life to regulate us, this law, through its regulation, will remove the negative element of striving and dividing into parties.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be saved from the law of sin and death, from the body of this death, from the mortality of the body, from being common, from a low manner of living, and from division are all results of the enjoyment of the dispensing of the law of the Spirit of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>REIGNING IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On one hand, the law of the Spirit of life saves us in life and delivers us from all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, it enables us to reign in life Rom 5:17b and to subdue everything that is contrary to God's righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anything contrary to God's righteousness, holiness, and glory is subdued by the law of the Spirit of life when we go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, this law of the Spirit of life enables us by life to be right, proper, holy, and separated in everything, and to glorify and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition, this law of the Spirit of life will enable us to subdue God's enemy, Satan, to trample him under our feet Rom 16:20 , and to bring in God's kingdom, which is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we live in the law of the Spirit of life, we will be proper and right toward others, toward any matters, and toward God, and our relationship with others and with God will be one of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit; that is, we will have joy before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All these are the results of the continual dispensing and unceasing regulation of the Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life in us.</S>
