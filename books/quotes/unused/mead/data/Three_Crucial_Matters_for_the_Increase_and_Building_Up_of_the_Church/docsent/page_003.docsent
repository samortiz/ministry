   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THE LORD S LOVERS BEING FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every lover of the Lord should be a full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some drop their jobs to serve full time, and others serve full time while keeping their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people are able to make money, but they are unable to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we ask them to speak a few words for the Lord, they are unable to speak a clear word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other people are the opposite; they are unable to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, those who are able to make money should make money for the Lord, and those who can expound the Bible and who have a gift to speak and teach should drop their jobs and serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gospelizing Taiwan in five years is not an empty dream.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we produce five hundred full-timers every year, we will have two thousand five hundred full-timers in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two thousand five hundred full-time serving ones will need more than two thousand five hundred money-making full-timers to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though God is omnipotent, He still needs man s cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A money-making full-timer should subtract from his earnings whatever amount his family needs to live on and place the remaining amount on the altar for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he does not practice this, he is not a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are the true Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Israelites were leaving Egypt, God told them to plunder the riches of Egypt Exo 3:22; 12:35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our heart is for the Lord, He will certainly bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should fear being enticed by money so that we are unwilling to give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If five thousand people in Taiwan are willing to live a life of giving their all to the Lord, it will certainly be possible to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I gave up my job to serve the Lord full time in 1933, there were only two or three thousand people in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These believers gave their all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to save money for the Lord s use, some people would walk instead of taking the electric tram.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were supported by what the believers gave.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we would receive a gift of one dollar when it seemed that we were about to eat our last meal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The environment in Taiwan today is rich; if we are willing to give everything to the Lord, He will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OUR NEED BEING TO GO FORTH TO SPEAK THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The educational standard in Taiwan has been raised because education is compulsory for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This has given every person, regardless of his occupation, a desire to learn the true meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christianity has lost the truth and has fallen into methods, traditions, superstitions, and shallowness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most people are tired of hearing the simple and shallow teachings about going to heaven or hell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They want to hear the truth concerning the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s recovery has the truth, but we need people to go out to dispense the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are happy that many of the young brothers and sisters pray using terms such as God s dispensing, God s New Testament economy, and divine transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the older saints in their fifties and sixties can pray with these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are also encouraged that the saints do not sing common hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The labor of the ministry has not been in vain because a number of spiritual things have entered into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The believers in the Lord s recovery are not the only ones who need the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The believers in Christianity and the unbelievers need the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How will all men come to the full knowledge of the truth if we do not go forth to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must see that our commission is to send forth the gospel and the truth as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE CHURCH NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>TO BEGET, NOURISH, AND TEACH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are three important matters for the spread and increase of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every country is founded upon its society, and the soundness of a society depends upon begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church, as a heavenly society, also needs begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church begets by preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need a plan to preach the gospel in every school, in every home of every neighborhood, to every level of society, and in every village.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After gaining people, we need to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In society nourishing takes place in the homes; in the church nourishing should take place in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that there will be a home meeting in the home of every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there are two thousand family units in Taipei, there should be two thousand home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every home should be for begetting and nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Taiwan places much emphasis on education, and everyone admires this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people in America showed me a cartoon in which a Chinese boy was studying while his mother was preparing a meal for him, his father was fanning him, and his younger brother was massaging his back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The entire family was helping him to study.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some Americans say that education is the current Chinese idol.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Parents in Taiwan economize on their food and clothing in order to save money to educate their children.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the church life we have Truth Lessons for our education.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need a change in our concept to emphasize truth education in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to our old system there were four kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was the big meeting on the Lord s Day that attracted people with messages.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every Lord s Day people asked who was giving the message that day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They loved to listen to the brothers who spoke eloquently.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There was the meeting for preaching the gospel, which was held whenever there was a need to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There was the bread-breaking meeting to remember the Lord, and there was the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We had these four kinds of meetings every week of every year, but we did not beget or nourish many people, and we did not have sufficient education.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the work began in Taipei more than thirty years ago, as soon as a person was saved, he was placed in a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We also had three or four months of training every year.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when I returned in 1984, there were only these four kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was a lack of teaching the truth for education and a lack of nourishing in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For this reason, my burden is to hold a training to train full-timers, elders, and co-workers to do three things: preach the gospel, build up the home meetings, and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is to beget, nourish, and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not intensify our effort in these three things preaching the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth the church will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some people say that the home meetings will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, if we do not go and practice, they will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether or not something works depends on our willingness to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, the freeways in Taiwan are flat roads, but when they were being built, many obstacles needed to be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The people who built the freeways needed to cut through mountains and build bridges over rivers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we want the church to be strong and the Lord s work to spread, we need a group of laboring ones to rise up to preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach the brothers and sisters how to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One brother invited a couple to attend a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the home meeting they read portions from The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The husband prayed to receive the Lord, and a brother baptized him in the bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While the husband was being baptized, the sisters preached the gospel to his wife, and she also was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This newly baptized couple came to the meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the function of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If the church in Taipei has four hundred home meetings functioning in this way, there will certainly be the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A person who believes and is baptized as a result of attending a meeting in a believer s home will remember this experience for his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Furthermore, we must emphasize Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is a locality near Taipei that holds two classes for Truth Lessons at four different times on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In one day they have eight classes in which they perfect the saints to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All teachers know that teaching a matter, rather than simply studying it, is the best way to gain a thorough understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we study something by ourselves, we can be careless in our understanding, but when we teach others, we are forced to understand the material thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Truth Lessons should be studied in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This method of teaching will enable us to enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Some people say that Truth Lessons are too deep and difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If a person reads a lesson several times, he will spontaneously understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When I was young, I read the statement The way of great learning depends on developing the bright virtue, and of course, I did not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, I later understood it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should never demean the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The elderly brothers and sisters are able to understand matters such as the divine dispensing, transformation, conformation, and the essential and economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the same principle, when we preach the gospel, we should not speak a shallow word because we fear that people will not understand us otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must speak the excellent truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If people do not understand the truth today, they will understand after they hear the truth over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our responsibility is to preach until every home knows the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Then everyone will know the truth and every family will speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>May all the churches in Taiwan practice begetting, nourishing, and teaching for the increase and building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>To practice these three things is to preach the gospel, to build up the home meetings, and to teach the truth.</S>
