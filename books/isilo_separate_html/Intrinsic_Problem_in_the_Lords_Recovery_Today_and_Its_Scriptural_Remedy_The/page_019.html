IN SOME OFFENSE&mdash;GAL. 6:1</h2>
<p>The apostle instructed the believers, saying that the spiritual ones should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. It is common for believers to be overtaken in some offense. Those who restore such a one should consider themselves lest they also be tempted. To take care of such a case of restoration, there is the need of spiritual maturity with a heart that loves the brother and with a burden to recover him. In carrying out such a restoration, we must do it in fear and with consideration, not in a light and careless way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIX. THE TEST OF SOME PREACHING CHRIST<br />
BECAUSE OF ENVY AND STRIFE, OUT OF RIVALRY,<br />
NOT PURELY, THINKING TO RAISE UP AFFLICTION<br />
IN THE APOSTLE PAUL&rsquo;S BONDS&mdash;PHIL. 1:15, 17</h2>
<p>When Paul was in prison, the Judaizers made more trouble for him. Paul rejoiced in that Christ was announced even in pretense (v. 18). Yet Paul considered those Judaic preachers dogs, evil workers, and the concision, and warned the saints in Philippi to beware of them as such (3:2). On the one hand, Paul rejoiced over their preaching, and on the other hand, he considered them dogs, evil workers, and the concision. (<em>Concision</em> is a term of contempt for <em>circumcision.</em> ) We need to learn of Paul in his discernment in judging things. In this case, the preaching of Christ was good, but the preachers were evil in their preaching because of envy, strife, and rivalry, and with a purpose to afflict others. We should not condemn the preaching because of the evil preacher, nor should we accept the evil preacher because of his good preaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XX. THE TEST OF TWO SISTERS,<br />
EUODIAS AND SYNTYCHE, BEING DIFFERENT<br />
IN THEIR THINKING&mdash;PHIL. 4:2</h2>
<p>It is easy for sisters to be different in their thinking. The apostle besought the two sisters to think the same thing in the Lord, and he asked his genuine yokefellow to assist the two sisters, who contended with him in the gospel (v. 3). The way the apostle took care of this case was gentle and loving. Gentleness and loving consideration for others are always necessary weapons in correcting others&rsquo; mistakes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXI. THE TEST OF WRONG TEACHING,<br />
EITHER BY SPIRIT, OR BY WORD, OR BY<br />
A LETTER IN THE NAME OF THE APOSTLES, CONCERNING THE DAY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING&mdash;<br />
2 THES. 2:2</h2>
<p>The apostle warned the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed and not to be deceived in any way (vv. 2a, 3a). He then rendered the proper teaching to the believers concerning the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing (vv. 3b-8). To solve this kind of problem, the right way is to give people the proper teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXII. THE TEST OF SOME WALKING<br />
AMONG THE BELIEVERS DISORDERLY,<br />
WORKING AT NOTHING, BUT BEING BUSYBODIES&mdash;<br />
2 THES. 3:11</h2>
<p>The apostle gave the believers the charge that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat (v. 10). The apostle also charged and entreated in the Lord that working with quietness they might eat their own bread (v. 12). The apostle&rsquo;s way in dealing with this case was very practical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXIII. THE TEST OF CERTAIN ONES<br />
TEACHING DIFFERENTLY, OCCUPYING<br />
THEMSELVES WITH THINGS OTHER THAN<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY, WHICH IS IN FAITH&mdash;1 TIM. 1:3-4</h2>
<p>The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted (vv. 5-11).</p>
<p>To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings. In taking care of such a problem that concerns God&rsquo;s economy, we need the adequate knowledge of the holy Word, which conveys the full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
