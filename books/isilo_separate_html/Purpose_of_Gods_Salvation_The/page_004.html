<p>In the universe there is the first creation, the old creation, and there is the second creation, the new creation (6:15). The first creation does not have Christ, but the second creation, the new creation, has Christ. In fact, the new creation is Christ. The new creation is the new man, which is the church. Colossians 3:10-11 says that in the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew but only Christ. Therefore, Christ is all and in all in the church, the new man. In order for Christ to be all and in all when we gather together as the church, we must experience being crucified with Christ so that it would no longer be we who live but Christ who lives in us. In our daily life we need to fellowship with the Lord, read the Bible, pray, accept the cross by the Spirit, consecrate ourselves to the Lord, and allow Him to gain ground in our being and live in us. We should not try to please or glorify the Lord by our own strength. We only need to allow Him to gain ground in our being and live in us. We do not want to initiate anything. If we would live Christ in such a way, allowing Him to gain ground in our being, when we gather together, we will be able to say that we are not expressing our preferences or intentions. Instead, we only have Christ. In our meetings there will not be sin or the world, but Christ will be all and in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEASURING BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of being spiritual but of Christ having ground in our being. True spiritual weight cannot be measured by anything other than Christ. The ground that Christ has in our being determines how much weight His element has in our living and walk. It is not a matter of doing things correctly or of appearing to be spiritual or gifted but of how much ground Christ has in our being, that is, how much of the element of Christ is in our being. Hence, we need a strong consecration. If we see that Christ is the centrality of God and the meaning of God, we would consecrate ourselves fully to Him. If we see that God wants Christ to be our life, we would be willing to stop living by our life and would allow the Lord to live in us. We would love to read the Bible, to pray, and to fellowship with the Lord. If we would thus allow the Lord to gain more ground in our being, we would spontaneously become persons to whom to live is Christ and in whom Christ is magnified.</p>
<p>The Lord desires to gain a group of people on the earth as His witnesses (Acts 1:8). A witness testifies the Lord by living Him out. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us this vision. Then we would say, &ldquo;Lord, I consecrate myself to You, and I allow You to gain all the ground in my being. You are my life, and You are living in me. I no longer desire to be the one living; I want You to live in me. I desire that You would become all in all with me and in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, may we see a vision in these days. Visit each brother and sister personally so that we would meet You in a definite way. Appear to us in the meetings and in our personal time, just as You appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus. On that day he fell down because he saw Your light and came to know You. In these days may we be those who meet You and see the vision of Christ. We want to know that Christ is the mystery of God, that He wants to have the first place and to be everything in us, and that He wants to be our life and to live out of us. Lord, may we fall down and place ourselves on the altar so that You may gain the ground in our being and be our all. May the words <em>it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me</em> no longer be merely a sentence or doctrine but a spiritual reality. May the Spirit work in us until we can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me as my everything.&rdquo; Lord, fulfill this prayer. We believe that Your word will not return to You vainly. Stretch forth Your arm to work alongside Your word. Anoint Your word to shine in us and to enlighten us. Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
