Appointing and Establishing the Days of Purim</h2>
<p>The triumphant Jews appointed and established the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar as the Purim to celebrate their triumphant victory over their enemies (vv. 17-32). In this way the feast of Purim was established among the Jews for the remembrance and celebration of the two days during which they destroyed their enemies throughout the great empire of Persia. These days were to be days of feasting and rejoicing and of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor (vv. 17-19, 22). These days were to be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and the remembrance of them was not to fade from their seed (vv. 26-28). The appointment and the establishment of the Purim was confirmed by Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew in writing with all authority (vv. 29-32).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Mordecai Becoming Second to King Ahasuerus<br />
and Great among the Jews</h2>
<p>Mordecai became second to King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and well-regarded by the multitude of his brothers, one who sought the good of his people and who spoke for the welfare of all his seed, that is, all the children of Israel (10:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Crucial Hidden Point</h2>
<p>The story of the book of Esther is a crucial hidden point for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s calling to Abraham for a land, a seed (a people), and the blessing to all the nations (Gen. 12:1-3; 22:17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. For the Fulfillment<br />
of the Promise through Moses</h2>
<p>The story of this book is also for the fulfillment of the promise through Moses that after God gave Israel into captivity, He would still take care of them (Deut. 4:27-31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. For the Fulfillment of the Prayer of Solomon</h2>
<p>In addition, the story of the book of Esther is for the fulfillment of the prayer of Solomon on the day of the dedication of the temple that God would take care of His elect in their captivity (1 Kings 8:46-53).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. For the Keeping of the Lineage<br />
of the Genealogy of Christ</h2>
<p>Moreover, the story recorded in the book of Esther is also for the keeping of the lineage of the genealogy of Christ through the survival of Israel in their captivity that Christ might be brought into the human race. If all the Jews had been destroyed, there would have been no lineage of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy for Christ to be brought into humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. To Keep a People<br />
for the Possessing of the Holy Land<br />
for the Coming Kingdom of Christ</h2>
<p>Finally, the story of the book of Esther is to keep a people for the possessing of the holy land for the coming kingdom of Christ. The people of God&rsquo;s elect who returned from captivity were small in number, yet they occupied and possessed at least a small portion of the earth, the holy land. This was significant because the earth had been usurped by Satan, and there seemed to be nothing left for the God of heaven and earth. However, God brought back a small number of His people to possess the holy land as a base for Christ to come back to establish His kingdom on earth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
