<p>In order for us to meet God&rsquo;s present need, to strengthen the church service, and to fulfill our hope, three kinds of persons should be raised up in the churches.</p>
<p>The first kind of persons are the gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11, which speaks of the Lord giving some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers to the church as gifts. First Corinthians 12:9-10 speaks of persons with miraculous gifts, such as healing, works of power, and the discerning of spirits. Romans 12:6-8 speaks of persons with ordinary gifts, such as serving, teaching, exhorting, and leading. All of these persons are needed in the church. There is presently a desperate need in the church for those who can speak for God in order to edify and supply the church.</p>
<p>There is a shortage in the local churches of those who can minister the word of God in order to supply the churches. As a result, the church life is not rich, our service is not strong, the light is not shining brightly, and our testimony is not sanctified. In order for the churches to be built solidly and to grow unto maturity, that is, in order for the churches to grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13), many people must be raised up to speak for God.</p>
<p>There is also an urgent need in the churches for those who can shepherd and teach. In many localities the new believers are like sheep without a shepherd; they lack care and leading. As a result, they do not function, and instead, they cause the testimony of the churches to suffer loss. In order to remedy this situation, many need to be raised up so that the childish saints can receive shepherding and teaching.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a desperate need for those who can be outlets for the gospel. Although the churches are actively spreading the gospel, very few brothers can give a gospel message. The gospel work needs all the saints to strive together, but these activities cannot be complete without gospel messages. In order for the churches to be strong and effective in preaching the gospel, many people must be raised up as strong and powerful outlets for the gospel.</p>
<p>In order for the gospel to spread in Taiwan, the church needs those who have the gift of healing so that the local Taiwanese people can turn from the many idols that they blindly worship to the true God. It is not hard to receive the gift of healing. It can be received through much prayer in faith. We hope that some local saints will receive this gift so that they can go to the countryside to preach the gospel and heal the sick. This will prove that the Savior whom we preach is the Creator of all things and is full of love and power.</p>
<p>The second kind of persons that the church needs is elders. The church is short of gifts and also short of elders. Elders need to function in many aspects and to strive and carry things out. The elders should be rich in life, mature, grave, broad-minded, and farsighted. They should have self-control, patience, love, and wisdom. They should also be full of ideas and able to manage, teach, and take the lead.</p>
<p>The service in a local church depends on the elders. The responsibilities of the elders include the leading and oversight of services, the management and arrangement of persons, the design and preparation of furniture, and the use and allocation of funds. Hence, those who serve in the eldership are precious and difficult to find. It is not easy to be an elder. Whether a local church is strong or weak, rises or falls, depends on the elders. A local church can advance for a few years without the help of co-workers, but it cannot advance without the leading of the elders. Therefore, strong and useful elders are needed in the church.</p>
<p>The third kind of persons that the church needs is deacons. Deacons serve the church and the saints. The deacons need to love the Lord, and they should also be spiritual, humble, and diligent. It is also important that they be cautious, dignified, calm, and willing to listen. Whether the service is carried out in a spiritual and strong way depends on the person of the deacons and on how many deacons function. Whether the business affairs are handled in a flexible and thorough way also depends on the person of the deacons and on how many deacons function. The qualifications of the deacons are not as strict as the qualifications of the elders, but the number of deacons should exceed the number of elders. In terms of numbers, the church has a greater need of deacons.</p>
<p>The church urgently needs these three kinds of persons. The services in the local churches are not strong because we lack these three kinds of persons. If the churches have gifts, elders, and deacons, the church service would be strong. We need to ask, &ldquo;How many gifts, elders, and deacons are in the churches? How many saints can function as gifts to speak for God? How many saints can function as elders? How many saints can function as deacons?&rdquo; It is hard to find these three kinds of persons in the local churches. When we visit the churches, we carefully observe the brothers to see if any can function as a gift to speak for God, as an elder, or as a deacon. The churches are nearly void of gifts, and the churches are short of elders and deacons. Hence, the churches are not strong. The saints in other localities might consider the church in Taipei to be excellent, but this is not our condition, because there are not enough gifts, elders, or deacons.</p>
<p>The churches cannot be strong if we depend on zeal but do not have enough people in these three categories. The gospel will not go out if we simply sing Hallelujah. In order for the church to be strong and for the gospel to go out, there must be an increase in gifts, elders, and deacons. We need many gifts, elders, and deacons. The churches are not strong because the responsibilities of the church are not borne in a strong way, and the responsibilities of the church are not borne in a strong way because we are lacking in these three kinds of persons. This is a serious problem among us. I hope that the saints in every locality will pray for this matter so that the Lord would give us those who are gifts, those who can function as elders, and those who are willing to serve as deacons.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
