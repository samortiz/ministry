[1]  CONTENTS Three Prerequisites Entering into Three Things Related to the Holy Spirit Keys to Studying the Bible The Practice of Studying the Bible Various Plans for Studying the Bible PREFACE
[2]  This book, How to Study the Bible, contains messages given by Watchman Nee in Kuling during his training for his co-workers between 1948 and 1949.
[3]  The Bible shows us what God has done for us in the past and what He has said.
[4]  We must let the word of God dwell richly in our hearts before we can hear His speaking today and before He can make us ministers of His word.
[5]  Only one kind of person can study the Bible, and we have to be that kind of person before we can study the Bible well.
[6]  CHAPTER ONE THREE PREREQUISITES I. THE NEED TO BE SPIRITUAL A. "The Words Which I Have Spoken Are Spirit"
[7]  In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit."
[8]  The words of the Bible are not only letters but spirit.
[9]  We also should recall the Lord's word in John 4:24: "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit."
[10]  Here the Lord points out a fundamental principle: God is Spirit, and man can only touch Him with his spirit.
[11]  God is Spirit, and we can only worship Him with our spirit; we cannot worship Him with anything other than the spirit.
[12]  When some unbelievers argue with us, we may not match them in eloquence or wisdom, and we may not be able to tell them profound teachings, but we have the confidence that we know God because we are regenerated.
[13]  If we use any other part of our being to touch the Bible, we are doing something apart from God, and such activity will not touch anything related to Him.
[14]  Some may ask, "I am regenerated, and I have a regenerated spirit.
[15]  But why can I not study the Bible well?
[16]  But we do speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory."
[17]  But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God; which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words."
[18]  As a rule, after a man becomes a Christian, he should know the things of the Spirit.
[19]  But why is it that so many brothers and sisters do not know them?
[20]  The reason is that though they have a regenerated spirit, they are not necessarily spiritual men.
[21]  But to have the spirit alone without living under the principle of this spirit, that is, without living in this spirit and walking according to this spirit to be a spiritual man, is useless.
[22]  Many portions of the Bible explicitly speak of light.
[23]  In Matthew 6:22 the Lord Jesus spoke on the light of the heart, saying, "The lamp of the body is the eye."
[24]  God grants us revelation of scriptural teachings according to the measure of obedience we render to Him.
[25]  The more we obey Him, the more light we will receive.
[26]  If we continue to obey God, we will continue to see.
[27]  Second, no one can be careless in reading the Bible.
[28]  As soon as we hear a brother speak on the Bible, we know whether he is a sloppy person or a careful person.
[29]  I have heard some say that we put on the righteous robe of the Lord Jesus, that God has given us the righteousness of Christ as our robe of righteousness, and that we are no longer naked, but now can come to God.
[30]  In the entire New Testament we only can find the Lord Jesus as our righteousness except one instance in 2 Peter 1:1, which means something different , never the righteousness of the Lord Jesus as our righteousness.
[31]  Some have said that the blood of the Lord Jesus gives us life.
[32]  They say that when we drink the Lord's blood, we acquire His life.
[33]  Third, in trying to be accurate, we must not become curious.
[34]  God's Word is accurate, but we must never search it with a curious mind.
[35]  If we search God's Word with a curious mind, we will miss the spiritual worth of the book.
[36]  The Bible is a spiritual book, and we must exercise our spirit before we can understand this book.
[37]  CHAPTER TWO ENTERING INTO THREE THINGS RELATED TO THE HOLY SPIRIT
[38]  First, the Holy Spirit desires that we enter into His thoughts.
[39]  If we do not know the intention of the Holy Spirit behind a portion, we are liable to make a mistake in quoting it at a later time; we may even twist the original meaning of the Holy Spirit.
[40]  Some parts of the Bible are subject texts, while others are explanatory words; some are primary in importance, while others are ancillary in function.
[41]  We should find out what the Holy Spirit is saying in a passage, how He is saying it, how many things are spoken of, and how many words He has used to achieve His goal.
[42]  First, we can separate the subject text from the explanatory words.
[43]  Verses 2-4 say, "Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[44]  This kind of paraphrasing requires that we be objective, that we understand the meaning of the Bible, and that we do not add our own thoughts to it.
[45]  ENTERING INTO THE FACTS RECORDED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT A. The Impression from the Facts
[46]  When reading the Bible, the Holy Spirit next requires that we capture an impression from the facts.
[47]  Once we have an impression of these facts from the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for Him to convey God's word to us.
[48]  Examples of Contrasts a. Zaccheus and the Two Disciples on the Way to Emmaus
[49]  In contrasting Luke 19 with Luke 24, we find a marked difference between the Lord's stay at Zaccheus's house and His entering the house with the two disciples who were on the way to Emmaus.
[50]  We have to touch the tender feelings of the Lord Jesus before we can realize who Jesus of Nazareth is and who this One is whom God intends to reveal to us. b.
[51]  The Lord's Feeding of the Five Thousand and Mary's Anointing of Him
[52]  Two incidents are recorded in all four Gospels: the Lord's feeding of the five thousand with bread, and the anointing of the Lord by Mary.
[53]  Many impressions in the Bible have to be studied by the way of contrast.
[54]  In John 11 we find another instance of men being dissatisfied with the Lord.
[55]  Martha said to the Lord, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . She was blaming the Lord for arriving late.
[56]  The Lord Likes to See Men Asking Great Things from Him
[57]  In studying the Gospels carefully, we find that the Lord took pleasure in men asking Him for great favor.
[58]  4 "Even the Little Dogs Eat of the Crumbs Which Fall from Their Masters' Table"
[59]  The story of the Canaanite woman gives us a clear picture of this principle.
[60]  When men sought to catch the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane, He stepped forward and said to them, "Whom do you seek?
[61]  In order to study the Bible well, we have to acquaint ourselves with the thoughts of the Holy Spirit as well as the facts from the Holy Spirit.
[62]  B. How to Touch the Spirit behind the Word
[63]  We must point out that this can be realized only through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, not by man's effort.
[64]  The discipline of the Holy Spirit means that God's Spirit comes in to replace man's work.
[65]  If our spirit has not been brought into harmony with the spirit of the writers of the Bible, at most we can be a teacher; we cannot be a prophet.
[66]  If our very person has not been dealt with and disciplined by God, and if God has not operated in us systematically, we will be shrouded with a veil when we come to the Word.
[67]  C. Moving from Sameness in Quality to Increase in Capacity
[68]  The Holy Spirit is matching our spirit with the spirit of the Bible.
[69]  The spirit of the Lord Jesus is thousands of times greater than our spirit.
[70]  As we begin to understand the Bible, we begin the process of feeding, and as we are fed, our capacity increases.
[71]  The starting point in our understanding of the Bible is a matching in the quality of the spirits, while the consummate issue of our understanding of the Bible is an increase in the capacity of our spirit.
[72]  Why do we treasure a portion of the Scriptures so much, yet another brother sees nothing precious about it?
[73]  This is because we capture the spirit of that portion of the Scripture, while the other brother does not.
[74]  The scope of our knowledge of the Bible depends on the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit.
[75]  If we are not rich in such experiences, our feelings will not be rich, and if our spiritual feelings are not rich, our knowledge of the Bible will not be rich.
[76]  Although Jacob was cunning, he became a very spiritual man in his old age.
[77]  When he went down to Egypt in his advanced years, he was very much different from what he was before.
[78]  Verse 5 says, "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
[79]  Among Paul's Epistles, 2 Corinthians stands out as the book that reveals more of his spirit than any other book.
[80]  Either we should give up reading the Bible altogether, or we have to bring our spirit up to the level of the spirit of the Bible.
[81]  In the previous section we took note of the person who studies the Bible.
[82]  Let us now turn our attention to the method of studying the Bible.
[83]  In studying the Bible, we must not only be right persons, but we must also have the right methods.
[84]  In other words, if we want to find out anything from the Bible, we have to search for it in the Scriptures themselves.
[85]  In order to have the word of Christ dwelling in us richly, at least we have to memorize the Scriptures.
[86]  But we can say that if one does not memorize God's Word, he certainly cannot have it dwelling in him richly.
[87]  If a man merely memorizes the Scriptures with his mind, but his heart is not receptive or open to God and he is not submissive or meek, his memorization will not result in God's word dwelling in his heart.
[88]  Yet if a man thinks that there is no need to memorize God's word because he only needs to be meek and submissive and open and receptive to God, he also will not be able to have God's word dwelling in his heart.
[89]  If we do not memorize it, we will forget what we have read, and we will reap little benefit from it.
[90]  If we compare the spiritual man with the spiritual things, we will see something.
[91]  If we realize that no Scripture should be interpreted by its own interpretation, we immediately will look for the meaning of "sharp sword" when we come to this passage, and from Ephesians 6:17 we will find that the sharp sword refers to the word of God.
[92]  Our mind should not be set on the Bible only when we are thinking about the Bible; it should be on the Bible even when we are not thinking about it.
[93]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PRACTICE OF STUDYING THE BIBLE I. ALLOCATION OF TIME
[94]  Every Bible reader must set aside a certain amount of time every day to study the Bible in a definite way.
[95]  Servants of the Lord do not need to spend more than two hours every day to study the Bible.
[96]  During the second twenty minutes, we can turn to lighter subjects, such as the study of specific words.
[97]  There are at least two to three hundred words in the Bible that need to be studied in depth.
[98]  For example, the word blood is used in the Bible over four hundred times.
[99]  The fourth period is ten minutes for paraphrasing the Bible.
[100]  When we have a fresh understanding of a portion of the Word, we should write out the whole portion in simple and intelligible language for the easy comprehension of others.
[101]  A person who is trained in this exercise will find meaning and significance in every word of the Bible.
[102]  If our emphasis is on how our old man is crucified with Him, we can say, "Because God has placed us in Christ, we are crucified together with Him."
[103]  If we come across a verse that we do not quite understand, we have to ask the Lord to shine on us so that we can express the verse in language simpler than the original and in utterance more concise than an exegesis.
[104]  While we are reading the Bible, we have to jot down notes.
[105]  In studying Adam's history, we have to know about his place in God's plan, his creation, his initial innocence and sinlessness, his relationship with Eve, his judgment from God and the promise he received from God after the fall, his expulsion from the garden of Eden, his life outside Eden, and finally, his relation to the last Adam.
[106]  In order to study the types in the Old Testament, we must first have a foundation of the New Testament.
[107]  The New Testament speaks of Christ, His redemption, the church, and the Holy Spirit.
[108]  Further on, we see in the book of Numbers that the Israelites passed through forty-two stations after their exodus from Egypt prior to their entry into Canaan.
[109]  In reading the names of the stations we get a picture of man's sojourning as well the condition for his entry into Canaan.
[110]  We can classify the prophecies in the Bible into two categories, those concerning Christ's first coming and those concerning His second coming.
[111]  If we are not clear about the different dispensations, we will think that some statements in the Bible are confusing.
[112]  The Bible contains many topics, including: 1 creation, 2 man, 3 angels, 4 sin, 5 the satanic kingdom, 6 salvation, 7 repentance, 8 the person of Christ, 9 the work of Christ, 10 the life of Christ, 11 the Holy Spirit, 12 regeneration, 13 eternal life, 14 eternal security, 15 sanctification, 16 justification, 17 selection, 18 forgiveness, 19 righteousness, 20 freedom, 21 law, 22 inspiration, 23 revelation, 24 the Body of Christ, 25 ministers of the word, 26 God's authority, 27 the second coming of Christ, 28 judgment, 29 the kingdom, 30 eternity, etc. At the beginning we can study one topic a year.
[113]  We can also classify the work of Christ into different categories: 1 The relationship between His person and His work, 2 His substitution, 3 His satisfaction of God's requirement for the redemption of sin, 4 His reconciliation of men to God, 5 His acceptance and receiving of men, 6 His priesthood, and 7 His mediatorial work.
[114]  Some have classified God's relationship with man in the Bible according to the following considerations: 1 God, 2 men in general, that is, humanity in general, 3 the individual, 4 the God-man, 5 God and man, 6 God in man, and 7 God over men.
[115]  Fourth, we have the God-man, which we see in the Gospels; the Lord Jesus is the God-man.
[116]  We can go through all the parables of the Bible.
[117]  After studying a few of them carefully, we will realize that there are certain principles to interpreting parables.
[118]  Once we identify principles, we will know how to interpret other parables when we study them.
[119]  We can study all the teachings that the Lord taught, including Matthew 5, 6, 7, 13, 24, 25.
[120]  The Bible contains many crucial chapters, such as Genesis 2 and 3, Numbers 21, and Deuteronomy 8.
[121]  In the Bible there are thirty to forty such crucial chapters, and we have to understand the meaning of each one of them.
[122]  We can group subjects such as the Lord's calling, His blood, and His work under the category of salvation; we can group all the work of the Holy Spirit under the category of sanctification; and we can group subjects such as endurance, testimony, and the power of the Holy Spirit under ministry.
[123]  The Bible speaks of all kinds of minerals and stones.
[124]  Names like Adam, Eve, Cain, Seth, Abel, Noah, Melchisedek, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Israel, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, Micah, Zechariah, Peter, etc., all have meaning, and if we research a little, we will find their meaning.
[125]  In the Bible we often find a passage written in a way that is different from the immediately surrounding text; the style of such passages in Greek is different from the rest of the surrounding text, and it more closely resembles poetry rather than prose.
[126]  We have Abraham's prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah, Moses' prayer for the rebellious children of Israel, David's prayers in the Psalms, Ezra's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Nehemiah's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Daniel's prayer in chapter nine of his book, the prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6, His own prayer in John 17, Paul's prayer in Ephesians, etc. If we study these prayers one by one, we will have a good grasp of the whole subject of prayer.
[127]  There are a few basic principles to dealing with difficult passages in the Bible.
[128]  First, we must believe that the Bible itself contains no difficulties whatsoever.
[129]  Whenever we encounter a difficult passage, we have to study it in conjunction with other passages before we can arrive at any conclusion.
[130]  We have to look for the answer elsewhere in the Old Testament.
[131]  If we look, we will find evidence that the sons of God refer to the angels.
[132]  Are the angels who leave their own place among the one third who fall in Revelation 12:4, or are they different ones?
[133]  I believe they are different from the original third who fell with Satan.
[134]  After we have a general grasp of all the books of the Bible, we should choose a few books and have an in-depth study of them.
[135]  The study of topics concentrates on subjects; the exact wordings of the Bible may not necessarily match the subjects exactly, but we can consider the content and the spiritual meaning of the texts, putting texts together that are similar in content and spiritual meaning.
[136]  If we serve God in His field as our Lord did, we spontaneously will be fed as we work because our food is to do the will of the Father.
[137]  He put several dozen verses together and grouped them into ten sections.
[138]  For illustration, I will list them in the following sections: Section One The source of our calling: The primary source God 1 Thes 2:12 .
[139]  This brother compiled all these verses together and grouped them into ten sections.
[140]  Once this is done, we have a clear picture of our calling.
[141]  If we pick up several dozens of these terms, we will establish a foundation in the knowledge of the Bible for ourselves.
[142]  Concerning God the Father, we can consider His name, His heart, His nature, His attributes, His power, His authority, His relationship with the Son, His way of redemption, etc. We must also group all the related verses together.
[143]  Every Bible reader should know one more thing: The Bible is God's revelation handed to us in many portions and in many ways Heb 1:1 .
[144]  God grants us revelation not only in many portions but in many ways, and every time He grants us a new revelation, it is more advanced than the old ones.
[145]  In the New Testament, we see Christ clearly in the four Gospels.
