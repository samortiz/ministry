   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT TO DO AFTER THE GOSPEL MEETING Taking Down Their Names</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The end of the message is not the end of the story; there are still many things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important thing is to collect the names of all the gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are our leads for future visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other items need to be put back in order.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The pens have to be gathered together in bags and placed in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seats and the hall must be cleaned and properly rearranged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After a man has heard the gospel, someone needs to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work of visitation should be done as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sooner we visit, the better the result.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Appointment of visitation can be done in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is best to finish the arrangement by Sunday i.e., the same day that the gospel is preached and to visit them that same afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On Monday evening the brothers and sisters can come together for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are two kinds of visitations: one in which all the brothers and sisters participate, and a special kind of visitation that should be done by specific people assigned by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOSPEL TEAMS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only must we invite people to come to the meeting hall to hear the gospel; we must organize gospel teams to bring the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Indoor gospel preaching is for drawing people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outdoor gospel teams are for bringing the gospel to people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord commanded the disciples to "go therefore and disciple all the nations" Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church in Hong Kong should organize gospel teams to go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not only good for exercising the gospel spirit; it will bring many to salvation who otherwise cannot come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Taiwan a person about to board a train saw men running after the gospel teams.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was curious, and he ran with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seventy percent of the saved ones in Taipei are college students.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many are out-of-town students who have come to Taipei for their education.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we send the gospel teams to the streets, we can gain those who are away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we only preach the gospel indoors, the number of people saved will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to organize gospel teams, we need manpower and money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to have trumpets, accordions, drums, banners, armbands, and T-shirts for these teams.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need some to play the instruments, beat the drums, and shout the slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our gospel teams in Taipei are big in number.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have an inner circle of ushers and an outer circle of ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The inner circle of ushers is responsible for sitting down and talking to the friends.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outer circle of ushers is responsible for attracting people to come to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some preach the gospel on the street corners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They kneel down with people and help them to pray and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This brings some to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Outdoor gospel preaching can build up our gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Nanking, one brother was a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day he put on a gospel T-shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the front was the word sin, and on the back was the word death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He passed out tracts on the street and exhorted men to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others considered him odd, but he led people to kneel down and pray on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He brought many to salvation this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PASSING OUT GOSPEL TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Hong Kong we should be passing out gospel tracts, putting up gospel banners, and making gospel billboards everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If possible, we should install gospel neon signs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the businessmen put up advertisements everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their goal is to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we Christians do not put up gospel advertisements, it is to our shame.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The merchants advertise in order to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We advertise for the gospel in order to gain men's souls, that others may receive the benefit of the gospel freely 1 Cor 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>History tells us that the newspaper was first used by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But today Christians have abandoned it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope that some will receive a burden from the Lord to give themselves to the service of gospel advertisement.</S>
