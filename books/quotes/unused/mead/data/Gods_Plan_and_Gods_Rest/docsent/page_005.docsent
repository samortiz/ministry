   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, we must distinguish the difference between the work of saving souls and the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times the work of saving souls is not necessarily the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Saving souls solves the problem of man, but the work of God requires that man exercise authority to have dominion over all things created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God needs an authority in His creation, and He has chosen man to be that authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we were here just for ourselves as mere men, then all our seeking and longing would be to love the Lord more and to be more holy, more zealous, and save more souls.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of these pursuits are good indeed, but they are too man-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These things are concerned simply with the benefit of man; God's work and God's need are entirely neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see that God has His need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are on this earth not merely for man's need but even more for God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank God that He has committed the ministry of reconciliation to us, but even if we have saved all the souls in the whole world, we have not yet accomplished God's work or satisfied God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here is something called God's work, God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God created man, He spoke of what He needed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He revealed His need to have man rule and reign over all His creation and proclaim His triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ruling for God is not a small thing; it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God needs men whom He can trust and who will not fail Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's work, and this is what God desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not lightly esteem the work of gospel preaching, but if all our work is just preaching the gospel and saving souls, we are not causing Satan to suffer fatal loss.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If man has not restored the earth from the hand of Satan, he has not yet achieved God's purpose in creating him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Saving souls is often only for the welfare of man, but dealing with Satan is for the benefit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Saving souls solves man's need, but dealing with Satan satisfies God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, this requires us to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know how the demons can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A demon once said, "Jesus I know of, and with Paul I am acquainted; but who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a demon meets us, will he flee or not?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Preaching the gospel demands that we pay a price, but a much greater price must be paid to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a matter of a message or a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This requires our practice, and the price is extremely great.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are to be men whom God will use to overthrow all of Satan's work and authority, we must obey the Lord completely and absolutely!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In doing other work it matters less if we preserve ourselves a little, but when dealing with Satan, we cannot leave one bit of ground for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may hold on to something of ourselves in our study of the Scriptures, in preaching the gospel, in helping the church or the brothers, but when we are dealing with Satan, self must be utterly abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan will never be moved by us if self is preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May God open our eyes to see that His purpose demands that we be wholly and absolutely for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A double-minded person can never deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May God speak this word to our hearts.</S>
