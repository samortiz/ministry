 <h2 class="head1">FIGHTING IN A WARFARE<br />
WITH STRUGGLING AND STRIVING</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to share one serious matter with you. I have also been a young man. I know all the young people dream that since they have given themselves to the Lord in a full-time way, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will surely have a bright future. As soon as the army advances, victory will be everywhere and the evangelization of Taiwan will be a great success. On the one hand, the revelation of the Bible tells us that the white horse, representing the gospel, will overcome again and again (Rev. 6:2). Yet, on the other hand, we must go through much warfare. The evangelization of Taiwan will undoubtedly be accomplished, but it will be through much struggling and striving. We must see that in the whole process of the evangelization of Taiwan there are fightings and strivings all the way.</p>
<p>The verses quoted in this message prove to you that Paul&rsquo;s life was a life of struggling. First, in Acts 15 we see that Paul and Barnabas were originally intimate co-workers, often fighting along side one another. They won a victory in Jerusalem for the Lord&rsquo;s truth. Shortly after returning to Antioch, they intended to visit the brothers. Yet, there was a dispute between them concerning whether Mark should be brought along. The dispute was so intense that they each went separate ways (v. 39). This was no small blow to Paul. Then came the difficulty in the church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 16:12. This difficulty somewhat had to do with Apollos. So, Paul urged Apollos several times to go with the brothers to rectify the situation there. But he was absolutely unwilling to go, and would go only when the opportunity presented itself. This incident really put Paul in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:14 and 15, Alexander frequently persecuted Paul and greatly opposed the apostle&rsquo;s words. Paul&rsquo;s co-worker Demas also forsook him, having loved the present world, leaving for Thessalonica (4:10). In the end, even all who were in Asia turned away from Paul, forsaking his ministry and teaching which they received from him (2 Tim. 1:15). These difficulties, persecutions, and forsakings were all a warfare to Paul.</p>
<p>Even though Paul met so many difficulties, persecutions and forsakings, he was all the more strengthened in the grace of Christ. He labored and struggled according to the operation which operated in him in power. By the time he was to depart from the world, he declared, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:7). Consequently, he could charge Timothy to &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). This means that whether the time is convenient or not, whether we are welcome or not, and whether there is opposition or not, we all should be firm and steady, and strive to preach the word.</p>
<p>We should &ldquo;sail on&rdquo; like Columbus who, not fearing storms or difficulties, went straight toward his goal. From this day on, we all must have such determination in the Lord. Regardless of others&rsquo; opposition and criticism, and in spite of others&rsquo; apostasy and backsliding, we will labor and strive in the way the Lord leads us. I believe these words are an inoculation to you against many negative things. Today, before the Lord returns and the kingdom comes upon the earth, there will still be warfare. In Ephesians, the book that reveals the church, Paul says in the conclusion that the church is a corporate warrior for executing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. At present, the church is waging a war against spiritual enemies, wrestling against the power of darkness. May we all strive and struggle in this war until a full victory is won. I believe that these words will equip you. I hope that you will bring them back and will pray and fellowship about them.</p>
