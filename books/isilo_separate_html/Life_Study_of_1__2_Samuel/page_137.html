Giving All That Belonged to Saul<br>and to All His House to Mephibosheth</H2><P>David gave all that belonged to Saul and to all his house to Mephibosheth, making Ziba and his household servants to Mephibosheth. David also asked Mephibosheth, who had a young son and who was crippled in both feet, to dwell in Jerusalem and eat at the king's table continually (vv. 9-13). This was the fulfillment, on David's side, of the covenanted love between him and Jonathan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. FURTHER CONQUEST</H2><P>Chapter ten is a record of David's further conquest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Over Ammon</H2><P>David tried to show kindness to Hanun the king of Ammon by sending word through his servants to comfort Hanun concerning his father, who had died (vv. 1-2). However, Hanun insulted the servants of David by shaving off half their beards and cutting away half their garments at the buttocks (vv. 3-5). Seeing that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon hired soldiers of the Syrians and men of Maacah and Tob (v. 6). When David heard of this, he sent Joab and all the host of mighty men. The men of Israel defeated the Ammonites, Syrians, Maacathites, and Tobites (vv. 7-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Over the Syrians</H2><P>The Syrians beyond the Euphrates helped the Syrians from Syria to fight against Israel (vv. 15-16). David defeated all the Syrians, and all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer king of Syria made peace with Israel and served them (vv. 17-19). From this we see that David was altogether victorious, that the surrounding enemies were defeated or subdued, and that many brought tribute to David.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_136.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_138.html">Next</a> </body></html>
