   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 12 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 15:21-22, 24-28</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>21 And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of 1 Tyre and Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>22 And behold, a 1 Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, 2 Lord, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>24 But He answered and said, I was not 1 sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>25 But she came and worshipped Him, saying, 1 Lord, help me!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>26 But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>27 And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Be it done to you as you wish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And her daughter was healed from that hour.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>21 1 The further troubling by the rejecting religionists caused the heavenly King to depart farther from them, even into the districts of Tyre and Sidon, into a Gentile land.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>22 1 Because of the rejection by the religious Jews, the opportunity to contact the heavenly King came to the Gentiles, even to a weak Gentile woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>22 2 The title Lord implies Christ's divinity, and the title Son of David, His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was proper for this woman, a Gentile, to address Christ as "Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, she had no right to call Him "Son of David"; only the children of Israel were privileged to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>24 1 The Lord was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, at this time He came to a Gentile region, thus affording the Gentiles an opportunity to participate in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This bears dispensational significance, showing that Christ came to the Jews first and that because of their unbelief, His salvation turned to the Gentiles Acts 13:46; Rom 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>25 1 This second time she addressed Christ only as "Lord," not as "Son of David," because she realized that she was not a child of Israel but a heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here in verse 26 another opportunity was created for the heavenly King to reveal Himself, this time as the children's bread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord a divine person and the Son of David a royal descendant, great and high in His reign.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies that as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can be the proper people in His kingdom only by being nourished with Him as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To eat Christ as our supply is the way to be the kingdom people in the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said that the children's bread should not be thrown to the dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that in the eyes of the Lord all the heathen are dogs, which are unclean in the eyes of God Lev 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord's word but admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, had come as a portion to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile land, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a realization this Gentile woman had at that time!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No wonder the heavenly King admired her faith v. 28 . Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>547-549</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>543-554; Hymns: #1145, #1146</S>
