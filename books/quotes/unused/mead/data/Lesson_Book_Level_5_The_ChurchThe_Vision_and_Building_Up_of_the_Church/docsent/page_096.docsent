   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After seeing the vision of the church and how the church may be built up, we must proceed to see the matter of the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians think that after they are saved initially, they simply wait to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They have no idea that they were saved as members of the Body to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some among us may think that we have nothing to worry about, because by His mercy, we are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that all of our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is also true that we are in the practical local church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet, we must labor diligently in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this lesson we will address two of the most crucial matters concerning building up the church increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH A. The Need to Increase</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The increase of the church is to impart Christ to others and make them a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The branches of the Vine bear fruit by imparting the life of the Vine to others and making them a part of the Vine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the branches of a vine do not bear fruit, there will be no increase of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fruit-bearing of the branches is the increase of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So the increase of the church is by the fruit-bearing of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the members must bear fruit; otherwise, there will be no increase of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today in Christianity, nearly everything is abnormal, even the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christianity today depends upon the giant preachers with huge gospel campaigns, but this is not so in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible, especially in the gospel of John, the real gospel preaching is the fruit-bearing of every member.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is just like the Tree of Life in the New Jerusalem: it bears new fruits every month.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the proper preaching of the gospel, and this is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not depend upon great preachers and large gospel campaigns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The normal daily life of the members of the church is simply to bear fruit; then there is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The proper way to preach the gospel is to impart Christ into others as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not trust in the great preachers; we have to trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every member of the church is a branch to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consider the fruit tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every kind of fruit tree bears fruit at least once a year this is a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do believe that as living members of the local church, we must bring at least one new convert a year to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose a branch of the vine does not bear fruit year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What do they do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They prune it or cut it off.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every local church must encourage every member to bring at least one new convert to the Lord every year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even to bring in ten or twelve a year is not too many, for that is simply like a cluster of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the local church, we should be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we come to the church meeting, we must come with some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not come to the meetings alone that is not a glory; that is a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to come to the meetings with others for the increase of the local church.</S>
