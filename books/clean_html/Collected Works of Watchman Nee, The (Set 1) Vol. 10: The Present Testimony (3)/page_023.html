<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 27</H2><P>We have seen that, when God created Adam, Adam had a certain kind of supernatural and miraculous power. Later on, this miraculous power fell as a result of Adam's fall. Those who are ignorant think that after Adam's fall, all the miraculous power was lost. But the facts of modern psychology prove that Adam's initial power was not lost; rather, it was hidden in his soul. During the past five or six thousand years, some people, though not many, have been able to demonstrate this kind of power, even those who have not believed in the Lord Jesus. In the past century, however, more people have been able to demonstrate this kind of power. In the previous message I mentioned many examples and cited much evidence. This evidence is enough to prove that Adam's initial power was only hidden within his flesh and not lost. Today I would like to talk about the relationship of the soul's latent power to Christians. If we do not understand this relationship, we will not know its danger and how to be on the alert. I would ask us to pay special attention to the following four matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR FACTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. There Is Unlimited and Miraculous Power within Adam</H2><P>We call this power the soul's power. The facts discovered in today's psychology prove that all the miraculous power is still within man. Since Mesmer's discoveries in 1778, many forms of the latent power within man, whether they are manifested in psychology, in Christian Science, or in other sciences, have been discovered, and we know that they are just the power latent within man's soul. Even in Buddhism and Taoism, various inventions including breathing, asceticism, meditating, and numerous miracles prove that the latent power inherited from Adam is still within man's soul. We should remember that this power was in man before man's fall. After man's fall, this power still remains; the only difference is that it has become a latent power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Satan's Goal Is to Rule over the Power<br>within Man's Soul</H2><P>Satan knew that within man's soul there was a great power which could do many things. He did not want God to rule over this power in man; instead, he wanted to rule over man himself and utilize this power to do many things. In the garden of Eden, his purpose in tempting Adam and Eve was to have the authority to rule over this power.</P><P>In the past I have talked about the spiritual meanings of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. The meaning of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence; it is to act independently. The meaning of the tree of life is to depend on God. The tree of life reveals that Adam's original life was only a human life; Adam still needed to depend on God and receive God's life in order to live. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, on the other hand, means that man does not need to depend on God; he can act, live, and bring forth fruit by himself. I mention this matter again because I want us to see the very cause of Adam and Eve's fall. If we see this, we will know what we now need to do. If we utilized and manifested the latent power in Adam, we also could perform many works of wonders. But we have to ask whether it is all right to have this kind of manifestation.</P><P>Satan is fully aware that this strange power is latent within man. Therefore, he tried to tempt man to become independent and lose his trust in God. The fall in the garden of Eden was nothing less than the separation of man from God, and man taking action independent from God. By tempting man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan caused man to not depend on God and instead do things on his own. He caused man to depend on his own ability to accomplish things. If we know the story of the fall in Eden, we will understand Satan's purpose. He desires to gain man's soul. When man failed, all his capabilities and miraculous power fell into Satan's hands.</P>
