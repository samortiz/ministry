<p>In Ephesians 2:21 Paul said, &ldquo;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; The phrase <em>all the building</em> in this verse refers to the universal church. However, in verse 22 Paul went on, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; In this verse <em>you also</em> refers to the local saints. In each local church we are in the process of being built together. If we wait until the next age to be built, we will miss the mark. We need to be built today. We need growth, transformation, and building. We are being transformed not to be beautiful precious stones to be displayed individually; rather, as precious stones, we are good only for the building. We should not merely be piled together. According to verse 21, we need to be fitted together, that is, made suitable for the condition and situation of the building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Able to Remove Ourselves<br />
from the Building</h2>
<p>Once we are built together with the saints in the church, we cannot separate ourselves from the building. If we decide that we do not want to be in the building because we desire more freedom, it is too late. Once we have been built into the church, we cannot leave the church. What a blessing this is! What a glory it is to be built into God&rsquo;s building!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY-CHRIST BEING EXPERIENCED<br />
TODAY IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is building the Body-Christ. The main burden in this book is the Body-Christ, which is the individual Christ built with all His members. In the Body-Christ, Christ is wrought into all His members, and all Christ&rsquo;s members are wrought into Him. The entire New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the Body-Christ. Today the church, the Body-Christ, is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; The Christ in this verse is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ&mdash;Christ Himself incorporated with all His members. We are incorporated in Christ by the growth in life. The more we grow in life, the more we are wrought into Christ and the more Christ is wrought into us. Growth in life results in transformation, and transformation is for something corporate and mutual. As we are transformed, Christ is wrought into us, and we are wrought into Christ. Our old element is discharged, and Christ&rsquo;s element is wrought into us. This issues in the Body-Christ, which today is the proper church life, expressing Christ and satisfying God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMPLETED DIVINE REVELATION<br />
IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A Garden and a City</h2>
<p>We need to see the vision of God&rsquo;s goal in the Bible. At the beginning, in Genesis, there is a record of creation. This record shows that God planted a garden (2:8). Among the many trees in the garden was the tree of life (v. 9). Near the tree of life, there was also a river flowing to water the garden (v. 10), and the flow of the river issued in three precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (v. 12). Bdellium is a pearl-like material produced from the sap of a tree. When the sap of a certain tree flows out, it congeals into a kind of gum, or resin, which becomes bdellium. Onyx is a precious stone. In this picture we see not only the heavens and the earth formed by God but also the garden planted by God with the tree of life and a flowing river, which watered the garden and issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stone.</p>
<p>To see the full meaning of the picture in Genesis 2:8-12, we need to go to Revelation 21 and 22. The completion of this picture shows that the garden eventually becomes a city. A garden is something natural, but a city is something built, or constructed. In this constructed unit, the building of the New Jerusalem, there is the tree of life, a flowing river, and gold, pearls, and precious stones. However, these materials are no longer scattered about; rather, they have been built up into a city for eternity. This is the completed picture of the whole divine revelation. The whole divine revelation is for this wonderful building, which is the Body-Christ. The Body-Christ is Christ with the church, the Head with the Body, and it is produced by our eating Christ, drinking the Spirit, growing, being transformed, and being built together.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
