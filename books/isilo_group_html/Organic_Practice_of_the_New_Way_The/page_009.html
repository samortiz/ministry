<p>As soon as a person rises up from baptism, you need to have a long time of fellowship with him. This is his first home meeting. I suggest that you talk to him about the Lord being the life-giving Spirit and being one spirit with us. You should tell him, &ldquo;The Jesus whom you have believed in has become the life-giving Spirit today. Originally, He was God becoming the flesh on earth. But for the bearing of our sins, He died on the cross for us and shed His precious blood. After He died and was buried, He resurrected again after three days to become the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is just like the air; He is everywhere. Although He cannot be touched or seen, He is more real than everything else. Everyone needs Him. Moreover, this Spirit is personified; that is, He is a person, a divine person. That is why if you call on Him today, He will enter into you. In addition, when God created us, He created us with a spirit. Not only do we have an outward body; we have a soul within also. Inside the soul, there is a spirit, which is our innermost person. Today, this pneumatic Lord has entered into our spirit and has regenerated our spirit, so that the two spirits are now one spirit. Now your calling and praying must be from this spirit.&rdquo; Following this, you can lead him to pray. By then, he may feel ashamed of himself. You can then lead him to confess his sins to the Lord. As long as a person is willing to confess his sins, everything will work out. This is like a person who has taken the wrong kind of food into the stomach. When the wrong food is vomited out and the stomach is cleared, everything will be recovered. When a person has &ldquo;vomited out&rdquo; all his sins, the result is the filling up of the Holy Spirit. With all these words, you have enough to talk about for the first home meeting. After this, you should set up an appointment for the next meeting. Preferably, it should be within the next one or two days. The reason for this is that newborn babies need special care.</p>
<p>Before you go to his home the second time, you should first pray at home, and you should confess your sins thoroughly and be filled with the Holy Spirit. While you are on your way, you should sing along the way. The best song to sing is the one you taught him the last time. When he hears your singing from within his house, he will join in as soon as he greets you, and the home meeting begins. This home meeting does not begin at his home. Rather, it begins from your home. This is what we mean by being organic. After you sing a few times, spontaneously, you can utter a simple prayer, &ldquo;Lord, how we praise You. We are all rejoicing. Our brother is happy, and we are happy. How wonderful this is! This is Your grace to us.&rdquo; There is no need for religious prayers. We have to turn our prayers into a kind of ordinary speaking.</p>
<p>Following that, he may open his mouth to say, &ldquo;Yesterday evening I was saved. This was really marvelous. But this morning, while I was rejoicing, suddenly I began to feel sad. Why is this?&rdquo; This is a question that has to do with the truth. It also has to do with life. If two have come to his house, you may not necessarily be the first to answer. The other one can first answer the question, &ldquo;According to my experience, when I am happy and there suddenly comes a sad feeling, often it is the Lord speaking to me that I have a problem within. You can pray to the Lord and ask Him why you are not happy. Gradually, you will be clear.&rdquo; After he says this, you can add some more to show him that this is the Lord trying to point out something within. For that reason, he should pray more to the Lord, so that the Lord will reveal Himself clearly to him. For example, some have cheated their companies before they believed in the Lord. They have coveted some money. Later, the Lord was shining on them and gave them a feeling towards this matter. They would then pray and would ask the Lord for strength and courage to confess the transgression and to return the money. When he obeys this way, he will feel happy. Some may have hidden away items like an image of Buddha. The Lord causes him to remember these things, and when he moves them out of his house, he will be filled with joy. This kind of fellowship has, on the one hand, the teaching of the truth and, on the other hand, the leading in life. In this way, he will be helped to grow in life.</p>
<p>The home meeting does not need to have a set topic. A question that a new one raises can become a topic. If the new ones are not very aggressive in asking questions, you can ask them questions instead. For example, you can ask them if they have prayed in the morning. This question will bring out many more questions. As for ourselves, first, we need to have some foundation in the Bible, some edification in the truth, and we need to love the Lord and have the experience of life. Only then will we know the others&rsquo; condition, and only then will we be able to help them. We are all going on the same way. I have walked through it ahead of you. Now I am leading you on in the same way. When we go to the meeting, we are not going to a worship service. Everything has to be organic. This requires practice. What I have just spoken is not imaginary. I have experienced these things and they have proved to be effective, powerful, and far-reaching.</p>
<p>After you leave the new ones, they will begin to experience something according to what you have instructed them to do. When you come back the next time, they will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! What you told us the last time was really right. Now I feel very refreshed within.&rdquo; Based on this, you can go on to say something more: &ldquo;This feeling of refreshment is there because the sins within you are removed. Now the Lord has the ground within you, and He can now move in you. From now on, in your daily life, whatever you do, whether things great or small, you have to follow the sense of the Lord within you. This sense is the sense of the spirit and the sense of life.&rdquo; In this way, you have given him another lesson.</p>
<p>There is no need to be too legal or regimented. Everything depends on how the Holy Spirit leads. If you would visit this one in this way ten times a week, he will surely become stable. All the mothers know that the period after a child is first born is the most dangerous one. It is easy to catch diseases at that time. But after a month or two, the condition will become more stable. When we help a newly baptized person to go on, the principle is the same. As soon as a person is baptized, immediately we have to feed him. This is why the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; If we do love Him, then we have to &ldquo;feed the lambs&rdquo; (John 21:15).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
