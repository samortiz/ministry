<h2 class="head2">The Killing Light</h2><p>I will mention another important matter: We need light to bring us to death. If we have not received scorching light, we should ask for it. It is true that we are weak enough, but when light comes, it makes us even weaker. When we become extremely weak, we die. We are like the lepers; the more the leprosy breaks out in the body, the better it is. When the whole body is covered with leprosy, the leper becomes clean. Scorching light brings us to nothingness. Logically speaking, how can a man resurrect if he has never died? Without death there cannot be the possibility of resurrection. Therefore, any grace that we claim before death takes us further from resurrection. Life, gift, and work should only come to us after death. Genuine light will remain with us until we die. This is not the time to ask for life, power, resurrection, and the new creation. This is the time to ask for a thorough shining of the great light. If we are in weakness, we should not ask for power immediately. Death does not require power. It is God's mercy that we can die. Without death, there can be no life. Those who have not passed through death cannot have resurrection. I hope that the brothers and sisters see this. When you are weak, you should not seek for power, but for light. When you find evil in you, you should not ask for an increase in life, but for a stronger shining of the light. You have to say to the Lord, "I need more light, greater light, intense and absolute light from You."</p><p>The mistake of our human nature is to seek to be useful when we find out that we are useless. Has anyone ever realized that resurrection only comes after a consciousness of extreme uselessness? Those who find death working in them, but who do not overcome in the end, are engaged in an act of suicide. Those who are able to overcome in the end enter the realm of resurrection. This does not mean that we should seek death in order to have resurrection. We should not think that we can exchange death for resurrection. All we should do is put ourselves under God's shining. We should say to Him, "I do not ask for power or anything else. I only ask for light." Our incompetence is absolute, and our corruption is thorough. When we lie down in bed tonight, we do not know if we will rise up tomorrow. It is strange that many people want to resurrect before they die. The light has not done enough work in them, yet they seek for recovery and resurrection. Let me repeat that we should not pray for resurrection or for power before we have died. We should only pray for the Lord's mercy and light. We have to allow the Lord to shine on us until we fall flat on our face. We should not accept help lightly or prematurely when it comes to the matter of resurrection. Asking for resurrection before we have died is the greatest hindrance we can pose. The Lord wants us to fall down, not to climb up. It is impossible for a person, who has not received an intense and absolute shining and who has not crumbled completely, to ask for resurrection. Resurrection is God's business, not ours.</p><p>Another thing we should beware of is looking inwardly at our spiritual journey. We should never look inwardly to find out if we have received any light. This is most foolish. We should trust in God's shining. We should trust in His mercy and trust that He will bring us into resurrection. If we want to be useful in His hand and want to serve as a deputy authority, we need more shining. The more we see our own weakness and corruption, the closer we are to death, and consequently the closer we are to resurrection. Any "grace" that we grasp hold of before we experience the shining of the great light is a delay to resurrection. We have only one basic need before the Lord, which is to know ourselves as God knows us. God exposes us through the light, and we know ourselves through the light. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p>
