   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you read through your Bible, going on from the Old Testament through to the end of the New Testament, you will see that the Lord's ultimate charge to you is not that you follow laws or teachings, but that you walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Romans 8:4 we are told to walk, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit here in Romans 8:4 is the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to walk according to our spirit because today the Holy Spirit is within our spirit and is even one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we walk according to our spirit, spontaneously we walk according to the Holy Spirit, because the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people walk and do things according to the mind, according to what they think, and according to what they like.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some who walk according to the flesh are doing sinful things, while others are doing good things according to their mind, their thinking, and their likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we Christians should walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easy to discern the spirit from the flesh, but sometimes it is not easy to discern the spirit from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps, for example, you may be thinking about visiting a brother, but deep within something is bothering you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should walk not according to your thinking or your likes and dislikes, but just according to the "inner red light" or the "inner green light."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to walk according to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To walk means to live, to act, or to have one's being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must live and act and have our being, not according to the Ten Commandments, or the so-called Sermon on the Mount, or some doctrines, but according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Practice walking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every day, from morning till evening, cease from your doing and seek to constantly remain in this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING LED BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse is a continuation of the foregoing portion in which Paul tells us that we must walk according to spirit v. 4 . In a sense, to walk according to spirit is to be under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inward life gives you the sense, even in small things, of whether or not you are under the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we are led of the Spirit by walking according to spirit and by setting our mind upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the leading of the Spirit mentioned in verse 14 is not derived from the outward environment, but from the inward sense and consciousness of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This leading proves that we are sons of God, for "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would like to say a word especially to the teenagers who might be reading this message.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While your classmates are talking in a worldly way, you may find yourself, at a certain point, unable to join in the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although nothing outward frustrates you, you do sense an inner forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This inward regulation comes from the life of God within you, the life which makes you a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your classmates may be discussing sinful things in a happy, excited way, but the divine life within you does not allow you to say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, it turns you away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This leading of the Spirit marks you out as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of this mark from the leading of the Spirit your classmates will wonder what has happened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will wonder why you do not talk and what is different about you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will wonder because they are sons of the devil and you are a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have the leading of the Spirit within you.</S>
