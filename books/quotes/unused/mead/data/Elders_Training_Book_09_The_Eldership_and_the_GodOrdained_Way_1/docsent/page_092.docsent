   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE WAY TO GO ON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to say a word to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our locality we should not do anything in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the present time, some of the saints may not feel good about changing our way of meeting from one person speaking to a meeting of mutuality with all prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may be concerned that nothing will come out if we begin to meet in mutuality and that this will result in a drop in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to consider the situation of the saints in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to fellowship with the saints who are concerned and with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also have to help the prophesying in the larger church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders need to do a supporting work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the church is having a prophesying meeting and nothing substantial comes out in forty minutes, the elders need to take the last fifteen minutes to speak a word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we first begin to take the way of meeting in mutuality, this may be needed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A word from the leading ones in the final fifteen minutes will fill in the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The elders should exercise to be very flexible in bringing the church into this God-ordained way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we have a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the Bible and many spiritual books that open up the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These can help us to get ourselves prepared to give a word full of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In some meetings there may be no need for the elders to supply something special to support the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we begin to take this way of meeting, the elders and certain gifted ones need to get themselves prepared and need to be on the alert to supply a word full of the riches of Christ if the meeting is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This God-ordained way will open up the mine for the riches of Christ to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every group meeting is a digging meeting, and every district meeting, the larger meeting of the church, is a meeting to exhibit, to display, the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have fifty meeting together on the Lord's Day, I believe five will be very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will always have some riches in their pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the others in the meeting do something to support and to supply the meeting, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they do not, some of the rich ones can function to make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, no meeting will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be very difficult for other Christian groups to take the way of all speaking in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible has not been opened up among them, and they have very few books to help them get into the riches of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But with us it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of the brothers and sisters in the recovery have the riches of Christ, and they have the capacity to release these riches for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They need to be given the opportunity to practice to release their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we will be faithful to take the Lord's ordained way, I believe that all the local churches will be brought on the right track within ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By that time the "custom" of the new way will be built up in the Lord's recovery.</S>
