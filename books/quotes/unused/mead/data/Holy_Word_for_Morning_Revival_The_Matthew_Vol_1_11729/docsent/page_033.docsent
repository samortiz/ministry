   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother's eye, but the beam in your eye you do not 1 consider?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5 Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will 1 see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 Do not give 1 that which is holy to the 2 dogs, neither cast your 1 pearls before the 2 hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1-12, concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 2 The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 1 Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the kingdom people will be judged with what they judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged with righteousness by the Lord; if they judge others with mercy, they will be judged with mercy by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mercy triumphs over judgment James 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 1 As the kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we must consider the beam in our own eye whenever we look at the splinter in our brother's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The splinter in our brother's eye must remind us of the beam in our own eye.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5 1 As long as the beam remains in our eye, our vision is blurred and we cannot see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>6 1 That which is holy must refer to the objective truth, which belongs to God; your pearls must refer to the subjective experiences, which are ours.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the revelation in 2 Pet 2:12, 19-22, and Phil 3:2, dogs and hogs here refer to people who are religious but not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>7 1 First ask, then seek, and last knock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to demand in the most intimate and most earnest way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>11 1 In the parallel verse, Luke 11:13, it is the Holy Spirit instead of good things, because Luke emphasizes the blessing of the gospel, the center of which is the Spirit Gal 3:8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Matthew stresses the kingdom of the heavens, good things should refer to the blessings of the reality of the kingdom, as revealed in chs.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not try to determine how spiritual others are, how much growth they have, or what is their condition in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you refrain from measuring others, you will be kept from criticizing them and judging them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mercy does not do any measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mercy is absolutely blind.</S>
