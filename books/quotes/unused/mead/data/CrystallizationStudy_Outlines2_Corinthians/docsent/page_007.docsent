   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Seven Living a Crucified Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Manifestation of the Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by the Excellent Power of the Treasure</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the Earthen Vessels Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:7-18 Second Corinthians 3 and 4 are an accurate and precious record of Paul s spiritual constitution: What the apostles ministered was their constitution; they ministered what they were, what they had become cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Phil 1:20-21a.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that their reconstituted being became their ministry cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 20:18.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life and the excellent power for us to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life 2 Cor 4:7; Phil 4:13: Paul said that he and his co-workers were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living...that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead 2 Cor 1:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, resurrection requires death, discouragement, and disappointment in order to be manifested v. 4; 7:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The working of the cross terminates our self that we may enjoy the God of resurrection; such experience produces and forms the ministry 1:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostles lived the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry: Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body 4:10: Jesus, in a positive sense, is always killing all the negative things within us in order to heal and enliven us Phil 1:19; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exo 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we reject ourselves in the morning to receive God into us, we have the sense during the day that a killing process is going on within us cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prov 4:18.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh 2 Cor 4:11: The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life; this daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection 1 Cor 15:31; 2 Cor 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The title Jesus implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth; the Lord s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So then death operates in us, but life in you 2 Cor 4:12: When we are under the killing of the Lord s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Josh 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross for the release of the fire of the divine life Luke 12:49-50; John 2:19; 12:24-26: The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is by the spirit of faith that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry 2 Cor 4:13; 5:7: We must exercise our mingled spirit, the spirit of faith, to believe and to speak, like the psalmist Psa 116:10a , the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind; doubts are in our mind cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Heb 11:6.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the exercise of our spirit of faith, we regard the unseen things of eternal glory, not the seen things of temporary affliction 2 Cor 4:18: The Christian life is a life of things unseen Heb 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s recovery is to recover His church from things seen to things unseen v. 27; 1 Pet 1:8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16: The outer man consists of the body as its organ with the soul as its life and person; the inner man consists of the regenerated spirit as its life and person with the renewed soul as its organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to live a crucified life, the life of the soul must be denied Matt 16:24-25 , but the functions of the soul the mind, will, and emotion must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued 2 Cor 10:4-5 so that they can be used by the spirit, the person of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our outer man is being consumed and worn out, but our inner man is being daily renewed by being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life: The Christian life is a life of being renewed day by day with the divine element through the process of sufferings 1 Thes 3:3; Jer 48:11: We are renewed by the cross, the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, and the word of God 2 Cor 4:10; Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23; 5:26.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be revived every morning Matt 13:43; Prov 4:18.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should come to the Lord s table in the principle of newness by forgiving others and seeking to be forgiven Matt 26:29; 5:23-24; 18:21-22, 35.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory 2 Cor 4:17: All the sufferings God has assigned to us have one unique purpose to renew us; today we are in the process of being renewed to become the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The weight of glory will become the beauty of the adorned bride v. 11.</S>
