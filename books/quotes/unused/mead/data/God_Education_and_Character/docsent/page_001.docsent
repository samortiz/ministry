   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD, EDUCATION, AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The human life is a long racecourse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You are young perhaps twelve, thirteen, or fourteen and are at the beginning of your course.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am eighty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have been running the course for many years and am at the finish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be sure, I know what we human beings need to run our course well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you found out what people need?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to what I have experienced, we need three things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that these three things are eating, drinking, and money is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we need is not eating, not drinking, and not money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the universe, the most important One and the first One is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our need is not eating and drinking, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not have God, you miss a lot; if you do not have God, you have not yet started your race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the worldly people do not know God, they have not started their course.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not know what the racecourse is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are simply in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are walking, even running, in the vanity of their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the time of their forefathers until now, they do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is pitiful not to have God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that the most pitiful person is the one who does not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may lose everything but you should not lose God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as you have God, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the second thing you need?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say it is the Word, the church life, the Body life, or to be burning in spirit, but if you have God, you have all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is the totality of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as you have God, that is enough; that implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may also say that we need a spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yes, you do have a spirit, but that is not the second thing you need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The number one thing young people need is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This may surprise you, but the second thing you need is education.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know you may not like to hear this; this may bother you a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may say, Oh, education!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From preschool to kindergarten, elementary, junior high, high school, and university we study books from the time we are four years old!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hate all the books!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You do nothing but handle book after book for exactly twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you would not spend twenty years for education, you might be a wretched person, never knowing that you need God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You need education.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this time you may be in junior high.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must reach the goal of getting a grade point average of 4.0.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let me encourage you to get higher than a 4.0.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Does this bother you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fact is, if you do not take my word, you will regret it when you pass the age of twenty-four, but that will be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The best time to get your education is from the age of four to twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That is the unique time; there is no other time for this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of you are close to fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That means that half of your age for education has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have only ten years left.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I must tell you that what your life will be all depends upon the upcoming ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please believe my word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you get a 3.9, that is wonderful, but when you are twenty-four, you will regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You will say, Why did I not spend a little more energy to get a 4.0 or higher?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some of you may say that this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No, this is not too much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to my experience of human life, education is next only to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I thank God that when I was young, He afforded me the opportunity, the time, to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I had God when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, at the same time I received a certain amount of education.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I encourage you all to consider your education, especially the last ten years of it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Next year you may go on to high school.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a total of four years of high school.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then you will go on to college for another four years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I encourage you, do not stop your education after graduation from high school.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is a problem for the country of the United States that many of the young people today do not like to go on past high school.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have to keep going on for another four years.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I would like to encourage you all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you do not get a Ph.D., you have to get at least a master s degree.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will take you ten more years from today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This seems like a long time, but in actuality, it is very short; it will go by very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not you are successful in the future depends upon how you spend these next ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Bible is very important, but I must tell you, education is also important for young people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not agree that any one of you would graduate from high school and then stop your schooling.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Anaheim in 1977, I gave a message saying that all the young ones have to finish college at least, although it would be better to get a master s degree, and it would be best to get a Ph.D. That word encouraged many young people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today many have come back to thank me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some said, At that time we thought that as long as we loved the Lord, that is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is good enough simply to wash dishes in a restaurant, mow lawns, or wash windows.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I told them, This is not okay.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You must go on to finish your college education.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But even this is not the best.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is barely up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You have to go on to get a master s degree, or even the more, you have to go on to get a Ph.D. A number of young people took my word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One brother, who is now my useful helper in the translation of the Bible, heard that word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He went on to study and received a Ph.D. degree.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Now he is very good in Greek and is the most useful helper to me in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, please take my word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You must have the goal to receive God, but in fact, you have already received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now you have to receive an education.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What is the third thing you need?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is not something spiritual such as consecration or full-time service.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is also not health, and if you say it is a family, that simply means you are anxious to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Rather, the third thing you need is character.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You must have God, you must have education, and you must have a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If a young brother stands to speak in a conference, he may think that he is in a good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He may dress very well with a light blue shirt and a necktie.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is not bad, but if he turns around, we may see that he has not tucked in his shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If so, he is wrong in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When you put on your shirt, you must tuck it neatly into your pants.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When I go into someone s room, I first look at the books on his desk.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>How do you arrange your books?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You must put them in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Every time you leave your desk, all the books on it must be arranged in a very nice order.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is to build yourself up.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In my eyes, many things about the young people are too free.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You need to be adjusted; you need to be instructed; you need to be corrected in many ways, not in only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The way you cut your hair may be wrong, and the way you comb it also may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>You need to build yourself up.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our proper person is our character.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our character is what we are; it is our being.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You have to realize, however, that character is composed of two things: your birth and your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>What is character?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Character is birth plus habit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>With all of us, though, birth does not occupy as much importance as habit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Character is mostly what we ourselves build up from our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Day after day, you have to build yourself up.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>All your parents probably taught you to have good manners at the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>That is the building up of a good habit, but it is not only that; it is the building up of a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In brief, you need God, you need education, and you need character.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Seventy or eighty years ago I was still young, so I know all the problems, situations, and gimmicks of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>A young brother may say that he was on fire for the Lord while visiting another church.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>However, that is too easy.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When there is a fire, everyone is burning, but when the brother sat in his room by himself, was he still on fire?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If he was not, then the burning was not his own; he simply took advantage of everyone else s burning.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>This is due to the lack of a built up character.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Even in seeking the Lord, in pray-reading, and in keeping a morning watch, you need a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The basic need is not your doing or your acting.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The basic need is what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>You have been in the human life for at least twelve years already, or perhaps fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>You have only half of your time left to build up yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Every young person should be built up by the time he is twenty-four years old.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>After twenty-four, even just at twenty-five, it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Please believe me.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>You must get yourself prepared and educated within the limit of twenty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>By the age of twenty-four, you must have God, you must have an education, and you must have a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Then you will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>God bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Amen.</S>
