   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BRINGING IN THE LORD S PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose that the elders in a church decide to study the book of Romans together in the meetings, but a few of the brothers and sisters speak out against it and suggest studying Ephesians instead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the surface this may seem to be a small matter, but it violates a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It proves that those brothers and sisters have not learned the lesson of submission and have not known authority and order.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If all the brothers and sisters were like this, how could there not be contentions in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once there is contention, we lose the presence of the Holy Spirit and fall short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, if all the brothers and sisters would learn the lesson of submission and recognize the authority and order in the church, then, whether the elders decide to study Romans or any other book or decide to do something else, they would all receive it joyously from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were such a harmonious situation, then it would surely bring in the full presence of the Lord, and the glory of God would fill the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not think that the authority in the church is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let me give another example to illustrate this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose that the sisters come to the meeting hall to clean and wipe the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The responsible brother previously told the sisters that the paint on the chairs is not waterproof and that they should use dry cloths, not wet cloths, to wipe the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, one sister who has never been in the cleaning service but who recently became zealous also comes to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because she did not understand the instructions, she uses wet cloths to clean the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sister who is in charge of cleaning knows that this sister is like a goldfish bowl that looks beautiful but is very fragile and cannot be touched, because once it is touched, it breaks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, she very carefully and with a gentle voice asks the sister to use dry cloths to wipe the chair instead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unfortunately, after being adjusted, the sister speaks up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She says, I came to the meeting hall to clean the chairs, so why are you criticizing me?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is it not better to wipe the chairs with a wet cloth?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is the church practicing dictatorship?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is this how you oppress the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, she does not come to clean the next week and later even stops coming to the meetings because she thought that the church was too undemocratic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you love the Lord with your whole heart?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are you willing to serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you want to see the church built up soon?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you must accept the breaking, tearing down, and subduing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only in this way can you submit to the deputy authorities in all things, keep the order arranged by the Lord, coordinate in harmony with the saints, and be built in one accord unto the Body of Christ in its full stature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must also see that we can learn this practical lesson only in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not easy to learn this lesson in other settings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would seriously learn these lessons, then when we preach the gospel, how powerful we would be!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we open and read the Word of God, how much light there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We would see how blessed a place the church is, and whoever comes to this place would definitely meet the true and living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are the lampstands appearing in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Christ with all His riches is the light upon the lampstand, and the God of glory is the light within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is altogether a miniature of the New Jerusalem, manifesting a scene of incomparable glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the work that God wants to recover in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must consecrate ourselves without any reservation to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must offer ourselves wholly for the glorious building work of God in the local church where He has placed us, submitting to the deputy authorities, keeping the order, accepting the limitation of the Body, and coordinating with the saints in one accord until the Body of Christ becomes full-grown for the glorious expression of all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May God bless every one of us that we may be joined and built together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May He also bless all the local churches that they all may become golden lampstands appearing gloriously in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the eternal purpose of God be accomplished soon.</S>
