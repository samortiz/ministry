<p>Genesis 49:10 says, &ldquo;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ as the Pacificator. As the Pacificator Christ is not only the Peacemaker; He is also the One who rectifies the situation between us and God and between us and one another. Christ has made propitiation for us so that there may now be peace between God and us. This was prophesied in Genesis 49:10 and fulfilled in Ephesians 2:14-16.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:14 says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;our&rdquo; refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, making both one. Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption this separation has been removed. Now in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, both are one.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 goes on to say, &ldquo;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;the two&rdquo; refers to the Jewish and Gentile believers. By Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man peace was made between all believers.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:16 continues, &ldquo;And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;both&rdquo; refers to the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only the uncircumcised Gentiles but also the circumcised Jews needed reconciliation to God through the redemption of Christ accomplished on His cross. The cross of Christ, on the one hand, has slain the enmity caused by the ordinances which were given because of the flesh, and, on the other hand, has redeemed us with the blood of Christ shed upon it. It was through this cross that both Jews and Gentiles were reconciled in one Body to God. Therefore, in these verses we have the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ as Shiloh, the Pacificator.</p>
<h2 class="head2">49. The Stone Rejected by the Jewish Builders<br />
 Who Became the Cornerstone</h2>
<p>Psalm 118:22 and 23 say, &ldquo;The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.&rdquo; Here we have a prophecy concerning Christ as the stone rejected by the Jewish builders who became in resurrection the cornerstone. The Lord Jesus quoted this prophecy in Matthew 21:42: &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the corner-stone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?&rdquo; The stone here is Christ for God&rsquo;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&rsquo;s building. In this verse the Lord said that the stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone (lit. the head of the corner). Christ is not only the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16) and the topstone (Zech. 4:7), but also the cornerstone. The Lord&rsquo;s word here unveiled the Jewish leaders&rsquo; rejection of Him and God&rsquo;s honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth.</p>
<p>In his preaching Peter also refers to the prophecy concerning Christ as the stone: &ldquo;This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone&rdquo; (Acts 4:11). The Greek word translated &ldquo;despised&rdquo; also means rejected. The stone despised, rejected, by the builders has become the cornerstone. Peter had come to know Christ as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle (1 Pet. 2:4-7). Peter&rsquo;s quoting of Psalm 118:22 indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the salvation of sinners but also as the stone for God&rsquo;s building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners and in whose unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God (Phil. 2:9-10), sinners must be saved (Acts 4:12). Therefore, the stone in Acts 4:11 is the Savior in verse 12. The stone despised by the builders has become the cornerstone, and there is no salvation in any other name. We can be saved only in the name of Jesus, and Jesus is the stone. He is the Stone-Savior. In the four Gospels we have the King-Savior in Matthew, the Slave-Savior in Mark, the Man-Savior in Luke, and the God-Savior in John. According to Acts 4:11-12, we also have the Stone-Savior, Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4 also speaks of Christ as a stone: &ldquo;To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.&rdquo; This living stone is Christ for God&rsquo;s building. Although He has been rejected by men, with God He is chosen, held in honor. The Greek word translated &ldquo;held in honor&rdquo; also means precious. This word indicates preciousness as recognized and held in honor. As we experience Christ as the stone living in us, He makes us living stones, transformed with His stone nature, so that we may be built with others a spiritual house upon Him as the foundation and cornerstone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">50. A Stone of Stumbling,<br />
a Rock of Offense, at Which Israel Stumbled</h2>
<p>Christ is also a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense, at which Israel stumbled. This is prophesied in Isaiah 8:14 and 15: &ldquo;He shall be&#133;for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.&rdquo; Because Israel rejected Him, He became to Israel a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense. This word is fulfilled in Romans 9:32-33a; Luke 2:34; and 1 Peter 2:8. Christ was appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel so that many of them would be stumbled by Him and many raised up by Him.</p>
<p>Regarding Christ as a stone of stumbling, 1 Peter 2:8 says, &ldquo;A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the reliable Christ (1 Pet. 2:6), being rejected, became a stumbling stone, at which the rejecting Judaizers stumbled (Matt. 21:44). The relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; refers to the Jews&rsquo; disobedience with the result of stumbling.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the building stone but also the stumbling stone. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 21:44a, &ldquo;He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces.&rdquo; In Romans 9:32 Paul says that the Jews &ldquo;stumbled at the Stone of stumbling.&rdquo; The Jews who have rejected the Lord Jesus have fallen upon this stone and have been broken to pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head2">51. A Stone of Foundation<br />
on Whom the Believers Believed</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also a stone of foundation on whom the believers believed. Concerning this, Isaiah 28:16 says, &ldquo;Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in 1 Corinthians 3:11; Romans 9:33b; and 1 Peter 2:4, 6-7a. In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; As the Christ and the Son of the Living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay any other foundation. In Romans 9:33b Paul says, &ldquo;He who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.&rdquo; The same thought is in 1 Peter 2:6-7a: &ldquo;Because it is contained in Scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame. To you therefore who believe is the preciousness.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo; here is a kindred word to honor in 1 Peter 2:4 and 6. The very Christ chosen by God as a stone held in honor is the preciousness to His believers.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
