<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom." We have to let the Word dwell in us. We should not only memorize it, but we should also digest it into our heart. The Lord taught us to pray for God to give us this day our daily food. We should ask the Lord to give us our daily food. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of the Lord. Therefore, we must pray for God to give us not only physical food but also spiritual food and to teach us the way to eat this food so that we can store the word in our heart.</p><p>Our reading of the Word in the morning should be different from our ordinary reading; we should not read through it sequentially. Instead, while we read, we should meditate and pray. After reading one or two sentences, we should begin to pray. Never read without stopping. You have to pray in order to mingle your reading with prayer. These prayers do not have to be like ordinary prayers in which we say, "In the name of Jesus, amen." This prayer is a mingling of reading with praying. On the one hand, we read God's Word, and on the other hand, we speak to God through prayer. We have the Word of God before us, and we read it to ourselves as well as to God. While we are reading, we should pray. We should not read through hastily but digest the Word as we read slowly. If we do this, we will receive nourishment from the Word.</p><p>For example, Isaiah 54:1 says, "Give a ringing shout, O barren one, you who have not borne;/Break forth into joyful shouting and cry out, you who have not been in labor; /For more numerous are the children of the desolate one/Than the children of the married woman, says Jehovah." This means that the Lord can give man through the Spirit what he does not have in his flesh. When you read this verse, you should meditate on it and pray, "Lord, I am barren, and I have not borne anything. Spiritually speaking, I have nothing to give others. But I thank and praise You. I can sing because You can give to me what I do not have; You have the power."</p><p>Whichever portion you may come across, you can meditate on it and pray over it. Some people say that they do not have enough items to pray about. Actually there are enough items for you to pray about in the Bible already. Whatever you read can become the subject of your prayer. Many things in the Bible can lead you to pray, utter a praise, confess your sins, and make supplication for others.</p><p>When you come across a commandment of God, you may pray to Him saying, "God, forgive my sins, for I am weak. I have not obeyed You in this matter. I do not have this thing, and I am not this kind of person. Lord, forgive me." You may think of others and confess for others. You can say, "Lord, I cannot make it. I look to You to accomplish this in me." God wants you to be faithful. You can look to Him to make you faithful. God intends that you love. You can look to Him to make you love. When you read God's command in this way, you will find that all of God's commands are actually His promises. When God gives you a command, He also gives you the strength to keep that command. If you only see God's command and feel that He is giving you a hard time by asking you to do what cannot possibly be done, you have not seen that His commands are with promises. Remember the story of the young ruler in Luke 18. He heard the Lord Jesus' word, "Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" (v. 22), and he left in sorrow. He thought he could keep the Ten Commandments, but he could not do this one thing. He thought this commandment of the Lord was too harsh. But shortly thereafter, the Lord showed that His commandments are not merely commandments but promises as well. He said, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (v. 27). Thank the Lord that His commandments show two things: man cannot make it and God can make it. Before His commandments, we have to see that we cannot make it and that He can make it. If we see only that we cannot make it, we become sorrowful. But if we see that God can make it, we will praise Him. Many times when we read God's Word, we realize that we cannot make it. Since the commandments are so severe, we pray, "Lord, I cannot make it. But I praise You because You can make it. This is impossible with man. Lord, I cannot do it. But with You, nothing is impossible. So I look to You to accomplish this in me today. Please come and accomplish this in me." If we pray this way, we will see God answering our prayer.</p><p>When we read and pray simultaneously this way and learn to read God's Word in God's presence, we will gradually touch the spirit within the Word and discover the vast difference between our condition and the spirit in the Word. For example, we may read Philippians 3:18-19: "For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their stomach..." It is very easy for us to say that these are the enemies of God, and that their end is destruction. But it is difficult to touch the spirit of the writer of the Bible. If we read it casually through, we will not detect it. But if we pray while we read, we will read ourselves into the heart of the writer of the Epistle and see that he was full of love. One who was full of love was used by God to speak a severe word: "I have told you often and now tell you even weeping." Some had made their stomach their god. They were the enemies of the cross of Christ, and their end was destruction. This is a fact, and Paul had to write this. But while he was writing, he was full of love. It is very easy for us to speak severe words, but it is very difficult for us to have Paul's spirit. It is easy for us to be nice and speak nice words, but it is very difficult for us to speak severe words as he did. When we come to this portion and touch the spirit of the writer, we will know him as a person, and we will also know ourselves. If we do not touch the spirit when we read His Word, we will not have much feeling. But if we read and pray at the same time and our heart is turned to God and our spirit is open to Him, we will get into the Bible, and the Bible will no longer be dry and tasteless. It will be full of life-food, and while we are reading, we will be eating as well.</p><p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will read God's Word conscientiously every morning. Do not read it through quickly; pray as you read, and read as you pray. If you read this way for fifteen minutes, half an hour, or an hour every day, you will be fed and strengthened. If you eat God's Word today, you will find that the Lord is your strength today; He will carry you through everything.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>In addition to reading the Word in the morning, we must also spend time during other hours to study His Word. We have to read the Bible consistently, repeatedly, thoroughly, carefully, and systematically. Only then will the word of God dwell in our heart richly.</p><p>Other than our personal reading of the Word, we can also read a portion of the Word with the brothers and sisters when we meet together. It is also a big help to memorize the Word with other brothers and sisters. We may not understand one verse, but when it is recited through the mouth of another person, we suddenly understand it. This may sound strange, but it is a fact. Once the brothers and sisters come together, they will receive light which as individuals they cannot receive. Therefore, when brothers and sisters come together, it is better for you to not gossip. You can open the Word and read it. It does not matter if you do not understand it. Either one person can read while everyone else listens, or everyone can take turns reading. Or you may read the chapter you read today, while I read the chapter I read today. This kind of reading will uncover many hidden things in the Bible.</p><p>Reading the Bible is indispensable to a Christian. Young brothers and sisters should first develop a habit of rising early to read the Word. We believe that this kind of reading is most beneficial to the growth in life; it will unlock the power within God's Word. I am afraid that many Christians have been starving for a long time. They have been starving not only for a few days or a month but for many years! Perhaps some have never eaten God's Word from the time they became a Christian; they have never risen up early to eat God's Word. It is no wonder that they are so weak! Brothers and sisters, we have to eat God's Word. In the morning, we should pray and read God's Word simultaneously. This is to eat God's Word. May the Lord deliver us from spiritual poverty. May He deliver us from any form of poverty in His Word so that we may have the word of God dwelling in us richly and so that we will receive the supply of life from His Word daily.</p>
