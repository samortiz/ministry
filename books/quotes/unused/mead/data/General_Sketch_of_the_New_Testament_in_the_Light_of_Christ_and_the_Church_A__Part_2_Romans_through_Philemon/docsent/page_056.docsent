   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Shine as Luminaries in the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are two key verses in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One says that Paul was being poured out as a drink offering, and the other says that we shine as luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot shine as luminaries until we lower the standard of our living and are willing to give up our rightful position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not grasp our position.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To proclaim that we are professors or bank managers is to grasp our position, but if a professor would go to the street corners on Saturdays and distribute tracts to the people, he will be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Christ while on earth grasped His position as God, no light would have shined forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He gave up the high standard of being equal with God, put it aside, and lowered Himself to live in poverty as a lowly man from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of this, men saw the light shining through Him and out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides verses 15 and 17, verses 6 and 7 are also crucial, saying, "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For Christ to empty Himself, to make Himself of no reputation, means that He lowered His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our living and in the things we do, we must lower our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not try to be honored by people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To try to be honored by people is a wrong concept in our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we may be despised by others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For Christ to keep His position of equality with God would not have been robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was one hundred percent legal and right, but He gave that up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lowered Himself and made Himself of no reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was despised as a lowly carpenter from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not talk about taking Christ as our life in a vain way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To speak in vain about taking Christ as life is to enjoy a kind of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are serious, we have to lower our position and standard and be willing to be poured out on the altar as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the light will shine through us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the key to Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST AS OUR GOAL AND AIM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter three of Philippians shows us that Christ must be our goal and our aim.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 14 speaks of the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are in a race, and our goal is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the apostle Paul wrote this Epistle in approximately A.D. 64, he was already quite old and had been running the Christian race for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Paul was aged and very experienced in Christ, he did not have the assurance that he had arrived at the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was even afraid that he would miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So he said, "Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>13b-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The goal is Christ Himself as the prize to be awarded to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament the good land of Canaan was the goal for all the people of Israel after they were saved and delivered out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While they were wandering and pressing on in the wilderness, they had a goal ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The good land of Canaan is a type of Christ, who is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being Conformed to the Death of Christ by the Power of His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are many important verses in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 10 begins, "To know Him."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul knew Christ already, but he desired to know Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse continues, "And the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The death of Christ is a form, like a mold used for cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God puts us as pieces of dough into the mold of Christ's death, onto His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a person makes a cake, he conforms the dough to the form of the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, God puts us into the mold of Christ's death to conform us to it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is by the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Within us is the resurrection power and without is the cross, the mold, in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul's imprisonment provided the circumstances in which he was put into the mold of Christ's death that he might be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By himself there was no strength to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The strength was the resurrection power within him.</S>
