   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Based upon this, I realized something further.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the tree of life in Genesis 2 is a figure of speech, indicating something mysterious, invisible, and glorious, the same tree of life mentioned in the last chapter of the Bible must also be a figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tree of life grows in the New Jerusalem Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, since one item of the New Jerusalem is a figure of speech, the rest of the items must also be figures of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation is a book of signs 1:1 because it unveils to us things which we have never seen and which we cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based upon this principle, the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the book of Revelation should surely be a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need signs, or figures, to help us see the mysterious things of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old creation is altogether visible and physical, and the Bible tells us that God's intention is not to have the old creation as something that remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, God uses the old creation as the means to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The old creation is altogether physical, whereas the new creation is altogether spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam was physical, but the second man, the last Adam, is a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today in the universe there is such a thing that is called, in a figure of speech, the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have not seen it, yet it is there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is actually the very uncreated life, the divine life, the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That life is altogether not physical and altogether invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to describe it, God in His divine revelation uses a figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 1 and 2 speak of how God created the heavens and the earth with billions of items, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The created universe is physical and visible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only one thing mentioned in Genesis 1 and 2 is real yet invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That one thing is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tree of life is real but invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire book of Revelation shows us invisible things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you believe there are seven physical lampstands?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely these lampstands are not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seven lampstands signify the seven local churches Rev 1:11-12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A local church can be seen since it is physical, but if we are going to see the intrinsic reality of the local church, we need a figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the lampstands are not real lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are figures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They signify the local churches, not in the physical sense but in the intrinsic, invisible sense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Revelation, the Lord Jesus is described as the Lamb 5:6, 8, 12-13; 6:1, 16; 7:9-10, 14, 17; 12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4, 10; 15:3; 17:14; 19:7, 9; 21:9, 14, 22-23, 27; 22:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospel of John also speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When John the Baptist saw Jesus, he declared, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:36, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, the Lord Jesus was not a physical lamb with four legs and a little tail.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lamb of God is a figure of speech indicating a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the book of Revelation, there are the lampstands and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are also many other signs in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the end of this book, there is a great sign the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This should help us to realize that the New Jerusalem is not something physical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It must be something mysterious, something very intrinsic, something spiritual, and something which can never be apprehended by the human mind and seen by the physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have spent much time to study the last two chapters of Revelation concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I was in mainland China, I understood the New Jerusalem to some extent, but I was not completely clear until after I came to Taiwan in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the beginning of the 1960s, when we were fixing our hymnals both in Chinese and in English, I wrote some new hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Four of these are concerning the New Jerusalem see Hymns, #975, #976, #978, and #979 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These hymns express the understanding of the intrinsic reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the universe there is something called the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Body of Christ is not something physical like the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body of Christ is a figure of speech to indicate that the church is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This figure of speech must be used because no one can explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Things which are mysterious and intrinsic must be described with figures of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The book of Revelation is really a book of revelation, and in this book a great sign is revealed the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This great sign signifies the ultimate consummation of God's new creation work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this new creation work is fully accomplished, the old heaven and old earth will pass away Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's new creation work will take Him at least seven thousand years to complete.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Almost six thousand years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God will also use the thousand-year kingdom to complete His new creation work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's new creation work is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to make the old creation, God did not need to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For God to become a man and live on earth for thirty-three and a half years was not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Revelation 21 and 22 there is a picture of a holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This picture must be very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Over thirty-five years ago, I received the understanding of the significance, in detail, of every item of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hymn #979, composed of sixteen verses, gives the details of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to see what this holy city, the New Jerusalem, is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many in Christianity say that it is a heavenly mansion, but we need to throw away that inaccurate concept.</S>
