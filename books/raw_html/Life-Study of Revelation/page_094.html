<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN EYES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2><p>Zechariah 3:9 says, &ldquo;For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the Lord, but also the seven eyes of the stone. This stone was engraved in one day for the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people. The engraving of the stone was its being dealt with by God&rsquo;s righteousness on the cross for our redemption. Christ, the redeeming Lamb, is also the stone on which are the seven eyes. These seven eyes are the seven lamps for God&rsquo;s building. When we come to the book of Revelation, we see very clearly that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of the Redeemer, and that the seven eyes of the Redeemer are the seven Spirits of God for the building of God.</p><p>According to the book of Revelation, the Lord Jesus has seven burning eyes. Although these eyes are for searching, judging, refining, and enlightening, they are ultimately for transfusing us with His essence, His divine element. How can the Lord&rsquo;s divine essence be wrought into our being? By the transfusing of His seven eyes. Whenever we are searched, purged, purified, refined, and judged by the flaming eyes of Christ, we gain something of Him. Not only is some element of ourselves purified, but some element of Him is transfused into us. The natural things are purged, and the divine things are transfused into us. Through this process, the Lord builds us together and carries out God&rsquo;s building. The book of Revelation is not mainly for searching and judging; it is for producing and building up the New Jerusalem, the ultimate issue of this book. As a result of the transfusing of the seven eyes of Christ, the New Jerusalem will be built up. The seven eyes of Christ look at God&rsquo;s chosen people, enlightening, searching, judging, purifying, and refining them, and ultimately infusing them with whatever He is. By infusing us with His essence, He makes us the same as He is and, by so doing, He transforms us from being natural into being the same as He. Then we become the transformed material for the building up of the New Jerusalem. We all must see that the seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God and of the Lamb, are absolutely for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE EYES OF CHRIST</h2><p>These seven Spirits are the Holy Spirit. Being the Holy Spirit, They are not separate from Christ. According to doctrine, the Spirit and Christ are two separate individuals, but according to experience, They are one. Just as a person and his eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one. When someone looks at you, he looks at you with his eyes, and when his eyes look at you, he looks at you. It is ridiculous to say that the eyes are separate from the person himself. In our experience, the Spirit is the eyes of Christ. Those who attempt to argue about this may hold mental doctrines, but they lack experience. If they put all their doctrines into experience, they will find that it is wrong to separate Christ from the Spirit. The Triune God is not experienced in a doctrinal way. While some may attempt to define or explain Him, when we experience the Triune God, we realize that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and that the Spirit is the expression of the Son. They are one. The Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is realized, expressed, and experienced as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2><p>The Triune God is for God&rsquo;s building. In order for God to have the building, the Triune God must be dispensed into us. This is fully revealed in the book of Revelation. The controlling view in the Bible is God&rsquo;s building. If you have not seen God&rsquo;s building, it will be difficult for you to rightly understand the Bible. The whole Bible is related to God&rsquo;s building, and God&rsquo;s building is accomplished by the Triune God being dispensed into us. As we come to the book of Revelation, we must hold this view. If we do, we shall be able to understand this book and see that it is not mainly a book of judgment but a book for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
