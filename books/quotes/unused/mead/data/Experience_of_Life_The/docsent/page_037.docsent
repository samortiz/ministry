   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Functionally</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the conscience, in position, is so closely related to the inward parts; naturally, in functions also, the conscience and the inward parts have their influence on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, let us discuss how the intuition affects the function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When anyone has a lively and keen intuition in his spirit, his conscience is sensitive and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Take, for example, a very dark room.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If an adjacent room has a bright, shining light, it will somewhat illuminate the dark room.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, since the intuition is adjacent to the conscience, its function affects to a large extent the function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true of the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a person's fellowship with God is free, without any hindrance, the function of his conscience is also keen and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The deeper his fellowship is with God, the livelier and brighter he is within, and his conscience becomes more keen and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The three parts of the soul also affect the function of the conscience in a very evident manner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A clear, understanding mind, a rich, balanced emotion, and a strong, pliable will greatly affect the function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, a man's knowledge toward things greatly affects the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people are born with a dull mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their thinking is inaccurate; therefore their conscience is confused and slow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates how the mind affects the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In like manner, the emotion and the will also affect the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in order to acquire a conscience which functions normally, our mind, emotion, and will must be guided into their proper course.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The function of the conscience is also under the influence of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person has a righteous mind, a kind heart, and a pliable will, his conscience will be bright and keen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Should he hurt another even slightly, he will feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, if one has a crooked mind, a cruel heart, and a hardened will, his conscience will be dark and dull.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though he hurts others deeply, he will be insensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These influences are rather fine and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to realize and experience them in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. The Relationship of Conscience with Government</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some students of Scripture have divided the Bible into seven dispensations: the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first three dispensations are categorized according to the principle of government.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the dispensation of innocence we see the principle of God's rule; in the dispensation of conscience, the principle of self-rule; and in the dispensation of human government, the principle of man's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of the three kinds of government, the one which is under the rule of self is the one related to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the fall, no sin barrier existed between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the so-called dispensation of innocence, when man was ruled directly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He lived before God and was responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unfortunately, man failed under God's rule and became sinful within and without; so the holy and righteous God had to leave man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consequently, from the time of Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden to the time of Noah's departure from the Ark, God established the conscience within man to represent Himself in ruling over man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the so-called dispensation of conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this period man was ruled by his own conscience and was responsible to his own conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unfortunately, under this self-rule, man again failed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He ignored the rebuke and control of the conscience, the issue of which was murder and fornication, which proceeded unto utter corruption and fullness of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God judged this dispensation by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the flood, God told Noah, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" Gen 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because man was neither subject to God's rule nor obedient to self-rule, God authorized man to represent Himself in ruling over man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, not long afterwards there was the beginning of nations; there came into being among the human races the rule of political authorities, the power of the society, and the control in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, in a nation there are the president and the officials; in a factory, the supervisors; and in a family, the parents and elder brothers, etc. These are the authorities set up by God to represent Himself in ruling man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why Romans 13:1 says, "Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the dispensation of human government, in which man is ruled by man and is responsible to man.</S>
