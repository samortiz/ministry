   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I do not want to disappoint or discourage the young people, but I must say that with the young ones it is hard to have a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot expect a young sprout to bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To bring forth fruit a person needs maturity, and the maturity comes into being through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the young ones in the church life, but we need the mature ones even more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need those who have some ministry which comes into being through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not a teaching gift, not a speaking gift, but a life-producing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of how the outer man has to be consumed, broken, and reduced all the time v. 16 . The outer man cannot be fully reduced in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Soon after I was saved by the Lord in 1925, I thought that if I could pray much for one or two years, I would become very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now, many years later, my feeling is that there is still too much of the oldness of the outer man with me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to enter into the full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the foretaste for our enjoyment today, and we are waiting for the full sonship, which is the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have our old man decreased, reduced, and consumed is a slow process.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The young people have many dreams of being somebody in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One young person expected to be a great evangelist, but instead he became a big backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I love the young people, but we need to realize that they are not so trustworthy because they are in their dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They need the experiences of Christ through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul did not tell us how much he could do or what kind of gift he had.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he commended himself as a minister of Christ, he did not say that he had the biggest gift or that he was a great speaker, preacher, or Bible expositor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, in chapter eleven he commended himself as a minister of Christ by speaking of his sufferings in following the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>16-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He even said that five times under the hands of the Jews he received forty stripes less one v. 24 . I do not believe that we would write such a letter to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would want to speak only about the wonderful aspects of Christ, not about the beatings we suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul even mentioned the sufferings and perils he experienced in his journeys.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He spoke of being in dangers among false brothers v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may wonder why the Lord would allow such a great servant of His to suffer so much.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because the ministry is produced through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that the Lord comes back soon, but it may be that He will delay His coming just because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say that we love the Lord and that the Lord will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely He will bless us, but what do we mean when we say this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our dictionary is different from the Lord's dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord does desire to bless us, but His blessing us is according to the meaning in His heavenly dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the sufferings, we cannot experience the Lord as our blessing in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The chorus of Hymns, #626 says, "Each blow I suffer/Is true gain to me./In the place of what Thou takest/Thou dost give Thyself to me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every blow takes away something of ourselves and brings in something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should like this kind of trade.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He takes away a part of our old man and gives back to us something of Himself.</S>
