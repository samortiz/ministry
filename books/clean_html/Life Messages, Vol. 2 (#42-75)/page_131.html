<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD’S TWOFOLD LAMPS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:1b; Prov. 20:27; John 3:6; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4, 6; Rev. 1:10a</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD AND MAN BECOMING ONE</h2><p>The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one. It is not simply that the two are united together. Rather, it is a oneness in which He becomes us and we become Him. He is our life, and we are His living.<p>This relationship is an organic one. If I make a table and glue or screw the legs to the top, the relationship between the legs and the top is not organic; there is no living connection. Nor are false teeth organically part of us, even though they may look just like our natural teeth; the false teeth are lifeless.<h2 class=head1>GRAFTED TOGETHER</h2><p>Grafting illustrates the organic relationship between God and man. God is not only the Creator to be worshipped or the Savior to be believed in and followed. He comes into us to be our life. Even many preachers do not have a clear understanding of this organic union. They do not realize that “he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17). God and man are not pasted together like two pieces of paper; nor are they welded together like two pieces of metal. Because God and man are both spirit, when the two spirits touch, they join and grow together.<p>When a branch from one tree is grafted to another, the life from the second tree flows into the branch, and the two become one, sharing the same life. Similarly, with a skin graft a piece of skin from one part of the body is affixed to another part. This joining produces an organic activity which results in the two growing together and becoming one. If two similar living things have a wound cut in them, when they are brought together at the site of the wounds, there is a flow of life between them and they can become organically one. This wonderful life process illustrates the relationship between God and us.<p>Have you been grafted into God? I know you worship Him as the only true God. I know that you have believed in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. But my question is, have you been grafted into Him? Your being joined to Him is not like holding hands. You would never grow together with Him by holding His hand! Nor is your relationship to Him like that of two sticks tied together! Grafting requires the life juice from the cut tree to flow into the cut branch; or, in the case of a skin graft, the cells from both parts begin to “fellowship” together and then grow together.<p>This word grow, which describes an organic process, is used in the New Testament in reference to our relationship with the Lord (see Rom. 6:5; 1 Pet. 2:2). When God is added to us, He grows with us, like living tissue which is added to the body. He is not like false teeth set next to our regular teeth! God is Spirit (John 4:24). He created a spirit in man (Zech. 12:1). It is most precious that we have a spirit, because this is the means by which we are joined to God. The two spirits can become one and grow together.
