Because of Thee!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Golgotha! Because of Thee!<br /><br />Once was a day, because I feared to die,<br />I clothed myself in works, virtue to buy,<br />Tried to avoid God's laws encompassing,<br />But now I know He is my righteous King.<br /><br />Though days may come when nations cry with pain,<br />Thy raptured church shall Thy true blessings gain.<br />By Thine own blood sprinkled inside the veil,<br />She conquers all the violence of hell.<br /><br />The Lamb of God indeed my sorrows bore,<br />The Lamb of God has saved me evermore;<br />The cup of righteousness He drank for me,<br />The taste of death is gone eternally.<br /><br />In pastures green Thou caused me to recline,<br />Thou leadest me, the God of peace is mine;<br />Because of grace I lie upon Thy breast,<br />I taste of love the highest and the best.<br /><br />Each hour sweetly keeps me by Thy life,<br />Though evil spirits threat with daring strife.<br />Unto my Father I may look always,<br />Learning to trust midst darkness as in days.<br /><br />Lord, teach me to refuse the worldly fames,<br />To waver not through water deep or flames,<br />Willing to suffer shame and loss with Thee;<br />For Thy name's sake a martyr I may be.<br /><br />When I am raptured, brought before Thy face,<br />The Crucified shall be my song of grace;<br />From glory Thou didst come, didst suff'rings know:<br />On Calvary poured out redemption's flow.<br /><br />(Chorus)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of me! Because of me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of sinful men! Because of me!</p>	<p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></div>
