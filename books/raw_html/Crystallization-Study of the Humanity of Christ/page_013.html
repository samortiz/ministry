<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Measuring the Holy Building of God</H2><P>In Ezekiel 40&#151;43 Christ, as a man in His humanity, measured the holy building of God for His possession among Israel in the millennium (40:3-5; 43:6-7a). According to Ezekiel's measurement, that holy building will be wider than today's holy land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Walking with Daniel's Friends<br>in the Midst of the Fire</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, was walking with the three friends of Daniel in the midst of the fire. Because Daniel's friends would not worship the idol of King Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar gave the commandment to throw them into a blazing furnace. When he looked into the midst of the fire, Nebuchadnezzar said, "I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not harmed. And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods" (Dan. 3:25). This story in Daniel occurred about six hundred years before Christ was actually born as a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Appearing to Daniel<br>for His Appreciation, Consolation,<br>Encouragement, Expectation, and Stabilization</H2><P>In Daniel 10:4-19 the excellent Christ, the centrality and universality of God's move on the earth, as a man in His humanity, appeared to Daniel for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Being with Israel<br>in the Suffering of Their Dispersion</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, was with Israel in the suffering of their dispersion for God's eternal economy (Zech. 1:8). The children of Israel offended God and were given up by Him to be exiles in foreign countries. While they were suffering in their dispersion, Christ as a man in His humanity was with them in order to maintain Israel for God's eternal economy. If Israel had ceased to exist, how could Christ have been born to carry out God's eternal economy? Israel had to remain in order for Christ to be born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Measuring Jerusalem for His Possession</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, measured Jerusalem for His possession so that He would be her wall of fire round about and the glory within her (Zech. 2:1-5). Christ as a man would be a wall of fire around Jerusalem for her protection and the glory within her for His expression.</P>
