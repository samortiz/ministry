   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although this is a common way in today's Christianity, this is not the way shown in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The biblical way is to spread life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Human multiplication is an example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Human multiplication goes on year after year, and by this multiplication human life spreads.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not by any method, but by life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's ordained way is not the way of a great facade or of great achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the way of life spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new way annuls the way of facade in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must give up the thought of having a big congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must forget about this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as we still have this thought within us, we are in the tradition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today in the United States, there are approximately sixty-five million Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But some of the leaders of these major denominations have said that they are short of workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for this is that nearly all of the people are considered as "laymen."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have never been developed and trained; therefore, they do not know how to speak, preach, and often do not even know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When there is a need for prayer, they may ask a pastor to come and take care of this matter for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This has been the result of the way of Christianity in keeping a facade.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the recovery, though the number is small, nearly everyone can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some pastors in Christianity who have come among us have been surprised that most of the attendants in our meetings can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a big difference between the God-ordained way and the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The God-ordained way absolutely annuls the facade of the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In saying this I do not mean that we should not have any big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Acts 20, Paul passed through Troas and stayed there for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the Lord's Day, the first day of the week, Paul held a big meeting and spoke for the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is an example of a special meeting for a gifted person such as the apostle Paul to function for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such meetings are needed, but we cannot make the regular meetings of the church like this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The regular meetings of the church should be for the universal prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The traditional way of meeting, in which one speaks and the rest listen, has drugged us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An indication of our having been drugged by the traditional way can be seen in the way we enter into the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When entering the meeting hall, often everyone becomes very silent and remains silent throughout the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should enter into the meeting hall in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We could enter in by saying, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord Jesus, I am here, and I know that You are here, too.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Bless this building and fill this hall with Yourself, with Your presence, with Your grace, with Your love, with Your kindness, with Your light, and with Your life."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If everyone would come into the meeting in this exercised way, the meeting would be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A meeting in which we all speak Christ to one another will be living, rich, uplifted, strengthening, and glorifying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a proper Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We mentioned that in a recent conference in the Southeast, the saints used outlines for their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the practice of using outlines is like using a "cane."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The use of such a cane is needed because we still cannot walk very well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a while, we will not need the cane.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, when everyone is regularly contacting the Lord and having enjoyment in the Word, they will gain an accumulation of the experiences of Christ and a living storage of the living word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, everyone will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we come together in this state, everyone will have something to present from the storehouse in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The God-ordained way, negatively speaking, kills and annuls the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But positively, the God-ordained way develops each one's life gift, life function, and life capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as you are a Christian, you have the eternal life, and this life has the highest capacity, ability, gift, talent, and function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we need to see that the growth and spreading of life is gradual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, the grass in our yards grows and spreads gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we sow grass seeds in our yard today and go back to see it the next day, it seems that the yard is about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every day for many days it seems the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But eventually, after a number of months, a beautiful lawn full of green grass will cover our yard.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The spreading of life needs a certain amount of time and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not till the ground, sow the seed, water, and add fertilizer, the seeds may not grow well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You cannot just sow the seed, go home to sleep, and expect that the seeds will grow properly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a sense, the seeds grow on their own, but in another sense, there is still the need of proper care, fertilizing, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, there is the need of proper, adequate labor with a sufficient amount of patience.</S>
