   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two Verses That Speak of the Relationship between Gifts and Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament two verses speak of the relationship between gifts and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first verse is Ephesians 4:7, which says, To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The grace we receive is according to the measure of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, the amount of grace a person receives is according to the measure of the gift given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gift is like a glass, and grace is like water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The amount of water that a glass can contain depends on the capacity of the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the capacity of the glass is one cup, the amount of water it can receive is one cup.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, if a glass is large, it can receive a great amount of water, but if a glass is small, it can receive only a small amount.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much water that can come into the glass depends upon the capacity of the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, how much grace that we can receive is according to the gift that God has measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second verse is Romans 12:6, which says, Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gifts that we receive are according to the grace given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians says that grace is given according to the gift, but Romans says that gifts differ according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The relationship between gift and grace is of two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The two are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether it is grace given according to gift or gift given according to grace, in either case the two cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a person loses grace, he loses any related gift.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person loses grace but still exercises his gift, his exercise of the gift will be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The normal condition of a gift is altogether in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Explanations of the Two Verses Gifts Being Received according to Grace</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we spoke first of Ephesians 4 and then Romans 12, according to sequence Romans 12 comes before Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, Romans speaks of gifts being according to grace, then Ephesians speaks of grace being according to gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are saved, God first gives grace, not gifts; that is, God imparts Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Grace is God Himself the life of God, the Spirit of God and this is what God gives to us first.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God saves us, He gives Himself to us as life and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, we have grace within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we were saved, we had only sins and were empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now that we are saved, we have grace within and are no longer empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Upon being saved, God Himself God s life and God s Spirit came in. God, as life and Spirit, is grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Romans 12, God gives us gifts according to grace and based on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the gifts in Romans 12 are given according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s life, God s Spirit, and God Himself become grace in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is the basis.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Out of grace come gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within is grace, and without are gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The grace we receive is the same, but the gifts manifested in us differ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In some the gift of love is manifested, in others the giving of hospitality is manifested, and in still others the ministry of the word is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It may be easy for us to understand that the ministry of the word is a gift, but it is probably difficult to understand that giving hospitality is also a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most difficult thing for some Christians is to give hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some saints are willing to do whatever the brothers ask of them, except give hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Giving hospitality is too troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church, in the past there was always the practice of giving hospitality among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In recent years, however, the saints seem to have lost this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, they have also lost the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, there are some who having received God s grace are not only willing to give hospitality but also consider it the sweetest matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, giving hospitality has become their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this we see that gifts are produced out of grace and are given to us according to the grace within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though gifts may differ, they are the result of the same grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This can be compared to the circulation of blood in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When blood flows to the ears, it enables them to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When blood flows to the eyes, it helps them to see, and when blood flows to the mouth, it enables the mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if the blood circulation stops, almost immediately the ears cannot hear, the eyes cannot see, and the mouth cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only one circulation of blood, but when it flows to different places, it enables different functions to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Similarly, everyone has the same grace, but the gifts manifested within them are different.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have received the same grace, but the gifts that are manifested through us are different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul received a large measure of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Old Testament typology, the grace that Paul received can be compared to a large bull.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In contrast, we may have received only a small amount of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Old Testament typology, the grace that we have received may be equivalent only to a small pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the same grace, but its measure is different.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the gifts that are produced by this grace are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main point is that gifts result from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot expect someone without God s life and God s Spirit to have a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only a person who has the life of God has a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, in the Old Testament age it was a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the New Testament everyone who has a gift has life and grace.</S>
