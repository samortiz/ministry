   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XLVIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH THE REMAINING THINGS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ABOUT TO DIE REV.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3:2A</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This also is a picture of the Protestant churches, with which some of the positive things remain but are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>XLIX.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>HAVING ITS WORKS NOT FOUND BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>COMPLETED BEFORE GOD REV.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3:2B</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This also is a portrait of the present Protestant churches, concerning which no work has been found by the Lord completed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The three cases related to the church in Sardis all indicate a shortage of the vigor of the divine life and a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the vigor of the divine life and the power of the Holy Spirit can make us living, fresh, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>L. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING NEITHER COLD NOR HOT REV.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3:14A, 15-16</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The main meaning of the Greek name Laodicea is the opinion, the judgement, of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a local church is full of peoples opinions, it surely will become neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of its lukewarmness, such a church will suffer being vomited out of the Lord s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to be given up by the Lord because the taste of that church is repulsive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, a church that is full of peoples opinions, peoples judgments, is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peoples opinions are versus God s judgment and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the Lord is standing at the door of the church in Laodicea v. 20 , indicating that the Lord has been rejected by that church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LI.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BOASTING, I AM RICH AND HAVE BECOME RICH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING, NOT KNOWING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THAT IT WAS WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BLIND, AND NAKED REV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3:17</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An opinionated and lukewarm church would always be proud and boast of its riches, thinking that it has need of nothing, but not knowing its wretchedness, miserableness, poverty, blindness, and nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature , white garments the conduct approvable to the Lord , and anointing eye salve the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit as their remedies v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But they were abnormally different in these eleven cases, all of which are serious tests that have done tremendous damage to the oneness of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the Lord advised all seven churches to overcome all these tests that they might be rewarded 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, they will be punished 2:5, 11 by implication 16, 22-23; 3:3, 11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seven local churches in Asia were sovereignly arranged by the Lord so that they might typify all the churches in the seven stages of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, regardless of what stage we are in as a local church, we should take care of all the eleven cases of negative things in the proper way as shown in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord have mercy on us and afford us His grace and blessing that we might not be negligent and indifferent in dealing with all these oneness-damaging problems.</S>
