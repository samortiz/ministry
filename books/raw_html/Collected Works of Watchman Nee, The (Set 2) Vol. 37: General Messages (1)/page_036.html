<h2 class="head1">WASHING ONE ANOTHER'S FEET</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He also commanded them, "You also ought to wash one another's feet." This shows us that the church needs to continue the work of foot-washing. We have to wash each others' feet.</p><p>Let me ask if you have had the following kind of experience. On a certain day you felt that your spiritual vitality was completely sapped and you were depressed. You checked with yourself and did not discover any particular weakness or sin within. The only thing you felt was tiredness and a lack of energy. You went to a brother's home. He was a good teacher, and he gave you a good message. But the more he spoke, the colder you became. You left and went to another brother's house. You prayed with him and nothing seemed to have changed. After you left his house, you met another brother who did not preach to you or pray with you; he merely chatted with you a little. However, that little, unintentional time of talking and listening gave you strength and energy. After those few words, you could sing again. When you met him, you were grim. But after you talked with him, you began to say hallelujah. Before you met him, you could talk, but only reluctantly. After you talked with him, the whole situation changed, and you touched life. That brother supplied you with life. He washed your feet. Foot-washing is to supply other members in the church with life.</p><p>After a day's work in a factory or in a school, you often feel very tired and spiritually debilitated. There is not much desire for reading the Bible or for prayer. While you are in this condition, you may meet a brother in a meeting or at your home who knows the Lord. The minute you touch him, energy comes and you feel that you have touched God. He has supplied you with life and has washed your feet. Once you touch life, your spiritual energy is recovered, and you brighten up once more. This is washing one another's feet.</p><p>Among all the things that Christians can do to help one another, there is nothing more precious than washing one another's feet, and nothing is more important than to supply life to another member of the Body. If a Christian with spiritual weariness and weakness comes to a meeting and leaves as tired as he was before, the meeting is a failure. Every time we come to a meeting, we must bring life to it; otherwise, we will increase the burden of the meeting. Everyone should come to the meeting with life so that other brothers and sisters may touch life. As soon as they touch life, their spiritual gloom will be over. They will be shining, and they will be fresh.</p><p>A brother once attended a preaching meeting. When he came in, he felt very dejected. He checked with himself and asked if there was any particular sin in himself. He could not find any. Were there any particularly bothersome matters? No. Yet he could not lift up his spirit. He began to pray, "Lord, I need the supply of life!" Later, another brother prayed, and his prayer supplied the dejected brother, who then brightened up. This is washing one another's feet.</p><p>If anyone comes to the meeting in a passive way and does not care for anything but simply sits there without expecting anything to happen or helping anyone, he is not washing others' feet. To wash one another's feet means that we want to help others when we come to a meeting and that we want others to receive benefit. We do not need to consciously try to do anything; all we need is a heart to help the brothers. Most importantly, we must not burden the meeting. Sometimes we really feel we are short of strength, and our spirit can hardly be lifted up. At these times, we can open ourselves to the brothers and sisters to wash our feet, cause us to touch God, and render us spiritual help. But we must be careful not to always bring a burden to the meeting. If four hundred out of five hundred brothers bring their burdens to the meeting, this is too heavy for the meeting to bear. Whether or not a meeting is worthwhile before the Lord and whether or not one touches life depends on whether there is more life or more burden. This responsibility rests on every brother and sister. If many spirits are open, the meeting will have no problem at all, and many will spontaneously be revitalized spiritually. But if too many people sit back in a cold way, the meeting will become too hard to bear. Passivity is the heaviest burden to a church. No one can come to the meeting without praying or preparing for it. Everyone should pray and spend time before the Lord. Everyone should render help to the meeting with life. In the church meetings we should help one another, and then we will all be helped. To help one another is to wash one another's feet.</p><p>The Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." We must remember that the work of foot-washing has been committed to the church. This does not mean that one cannot obtain freshness by coming to the Lord, but it means that the Lord has commanded that we wash one another's feet. If we want to wash others' feet, we ourselves must be fresh first. If the Lord constantly does a new work in us, we always will have a new supply for others. It is a pity if others contact us and find us to be the same as we were five years ago, without anything new to offer. It is a pity if others have to wait a few years or even a few months before they can find something new in us. We need to be aggressive and active before the Lord and not stay still.</p><p>A certain sister, who had received special dealings from the Lord, bore a particular characteristic. Every time others touched her, they could sense God's new work in her and touch the newness of life in her. When others were out of touch with the presence of the Lord and felt spiritually tired, all they had to do was go to her and sit in front of her for a few minutes, and the tiredness would disappear. Something would come out from her, and one would sense the supply of life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you need to aspire to be ministers of life to others. Do not ever be disappointed that you are not as eloquent as others, or that you do not have as much Bible knowledge as others. As long as you live in life, you will be able to supply life to other members. Some people begin to pray in the prayer meeting right after they are saved. Their prayers may be very awkward, but when others touch them, they receive light and supply. Yet after these ones have been Christians for a period of time, the life supply in them becomes less and less. Having lived the Christian life for a few years, they pick up much knowledge and many doctrines, yet there is a lack of the supply of life. The supply of life is not a matter of knowledge but a matter of freshness. It is better to have less knowledge and less doctrine than it is to lose the supply of life. We should ask the Lord to deliver us from our inability to supply life and should pray that we live before Him in a genuine way. If we live before the Lord and are in touch with life, we will supply others with life and wash their feet every time we contact them. They will receive the freshness of life and be recovered spiritually.</p><p>We must also remember that foot-washing is a mutual matter. We should learn before the Lord to supply others, and we should also learn to receive the supply from others. The reason we need to be humble is so that we can receive help from others. We need to wash others' dark spots, and we should be willing to let others wash our dark spots. Through this mutual foot-washing, mutual serving, and mutual supplying we can be built up, helped along, and run the race before us.</p><p>Acts 18:5 is a very precious word, "And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word." This shows us that Silas and Timothy supplied life to Paul. Silas and Timothy did not preach to Paul. Their coming was sufficient to cause Paul to be constrained by the word. Paul had been preaching and reasoning in the synagogue and laboring for the work, but upon the arrival of Silas and Timothy, Paul began to be constrained by the word. He was energized because he had received new supply from the two. Indeed, when we contact some people, the mere touch will bring life to us.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, before God we should pursue being used by Him as a minister of life to others. The basic requirement of one who always ministers life to others is to be one who always receives the dealing of the cross. Our natural life must be broken by the Lord. If we do not have the inner working of the cross, we can only minister knowledge or eloquence to others; we cannot minister the Spirit or the life of Christ to them. If our knowledge and eloquence are greater than our spirit, the impression we give to others will be of our knowledge and eloquence rather than of our spirit. We must continually live before the Lord, contacting Him and fellowshipping with Him, before we can minister life to others. We must remember that the supply of life is spontaneous rather than artificial. It is true that we need to wash with water, but this water is not pumped up by human efforts; rather, it flows from the source of life. If we live in life, we will spontaneously have the supply of life and will automatically wash others' feet with life. Others will touch the Lord just by one contact with us; they will feel the Lord's presence and will become more intimate with Him. We need to pray that the Lord grants us grace to reach this goal.</p><p>Note: This chapter is on the spiritual significance of foot-washing. There is, of course, the literal application of foot-washing as an act as mentioned in Genesis 18:4, 19:2, and 1 Timothy 5:10. The latter is an expression of love and humility.</p>
