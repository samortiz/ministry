   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If such a person leaves the word of the beginning of Christ today and slips and falls, there is no repentance for him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He cannot start all over again to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has too much history with the Lord already.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has received so much rain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has fallen and does not bring forth good things for God, but has brought forth thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He, like "the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Notice three things about such a person and his end. First, he is disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "disapproved" here is the same word as that used in 1 Corinthians 9:27 where Paul said that he feared that though he had preached the gospel to others, he himself would be rejected and would not be used by God anymore in this age and in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be disapproved, to be rejected, means that God will reject such a one and will not use him anymore in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, such a person is "near a curse."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The verse does not say that he will receive a curse, but the punishment that he receives is similar to a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will not perish forever, but he will suffer the hurt of the second death and will suffer the Gehenna of fire in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, his "end is to be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a few weeks ago, I intended to burn up some land in Jen-ru.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Could I burn the land forever?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Could I burn the land for even five years?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The burning here refers to something temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here it speaks about burning, whereas Matthew 5 says that some will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you put these two passages together, they match each other.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a Christian receives all these wonderful things but does not bear good fruit to God, but rather thorns and thistles, he will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However this burning will only be for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even an elementary school boy knows that if you burn a piece of land, the burning will stop after all the thorns are burned up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The burning in the kingdom will go on at most for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How long it will actually burn depends on you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have brought forth many thorns and thistles, then there will be more burning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have brought forth few thorns and thistles, then there will be less burning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How many things are there in us that are still not dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How many things have not been cleansed away by the Lord's blood, and how many things are not yet confessed, dealt with, and settled with the brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are the thorns and thistles referred to by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 5 the Lord said that one cannot go out from there until every quadrans is paid.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the debts have to be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When everything is burned away, all the debts will be paid.</S>
