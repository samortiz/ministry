   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPLIED BY THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are also supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 16:7 is the Spirit of Jesus, and in Romans 8:9 is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Philippians 1:19 is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The emphasis of the Spirit of Jesus is upon humanity and strength for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the emphasis of the Spirit of Christ is upon the resurrection and the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Spirit that can support us and sustain us to withstand all kinds of sufferings and to live a transcendent life, a resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was under the suffering of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Imprisonment was a great suffering to Paul, but he said that through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, he could be sustained to live and magnify Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this bountiful Spirit, Paul not only was able to withstand the suffering of imprisonment but also was able to live Christ and magnify Christ through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To magnify Christ is to live a resurrection life, a transcendent life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Imprisonment could not confine this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul could withstand imprisonment and magnify Christ by living Him because he was fully supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we can experience the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we can live a transcendent life to express Christ in the way of magnification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>RENEWED BY THE REGENERATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another organic process in the Spirit experienced by us is that we are being renewed by the regenerating Spirit Titus 3:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our Christian life, we are undergoing a process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we are up and other times we are down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether you feel high or low, up or down, strengthened or disappointed and discouraged, you are undergoing a renewing process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not encourage you to be disappointed or down, but the Christian life in our experience is always up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not know how to weep or laugh, you are not a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may be like a marble Mary in front of some Catholic cathedrals who never weeps or laughs because she is a statue, not a living Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that to be down is bad and that to be up is good, but for the renewing we need to be up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, it is not good to be down for too long a time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you are down, do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After some time, you will be up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you are down, you are ready to be up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when you are up, do not rejoice too much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are up, you are ready to be down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This process of being up and down is the process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have seen some saints who were down for three months or even one year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may feel that some of the saints conditions are pitiful and hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But do not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as a person is a Christian, there is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A Christian may be down today, but some day he will be up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the latest, he will be up when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ups and downs are the process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to realize that it is easier to stand than it is to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is normal for a person to stand, but there has to be a strong factor to make him fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not worry about the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy for them to stand, but not so easy for them to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle set up by God is that we stand Rom 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may fall down, but do not worry because you will be up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you recall your falling down, you may feel ashamed, but you will have a deeper sensation that you experienced much renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because the indwelling Spirit falls down with us when we fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also imparts the divine element into our being to renew us for our transformation into the image of Christ Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>SANCTIFIED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we are being renewed by the Spirit, we are also being sanctified by the Holy Spirit Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To be sanctified means that some element of God s holy nature has been wrought into our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Much of the time God s nature is wrought into us when we feel down.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we feel that we are up, not much of God s holy nature can be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are feeling down and disappointed, that provides an opportunity for the holy nature to be wrought into our nature to make us holy, that is, to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sanctification is an organic process in the Spirit that we need to experience daily.</S>
