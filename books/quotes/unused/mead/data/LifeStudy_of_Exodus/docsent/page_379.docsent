   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 4 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:14-16, 19 ENJOYING THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the tabernacle and the court of the tabernacle, there are two aspects of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Outwardly, God s expression is righteousness, signified by the linen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Inwardly, God s expression is holiness, signified by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we enter into the realm, the sphere, of God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God s judgment, where everything related to us is judged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we are qualified to bear God s righteousness as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we also have the ground, the way, and the means to enter into the gold, into God s nature, and to enjoy the divine nature as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have pointed out, in the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies everything is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This signifies that God s nature is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By enjoying the divine nature, we have the inward expression of God, that is, holiness as the expression of God s nature, of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s outward expression is related to what He does, His doings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s inward expression is related to what He is, to His being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be in the Holy of Holies is to be in God s golden nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE EXPERIENCE OF JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that we all shall realize something vital concerning God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who desires to come into God s building must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from the gate of judgment, there is no way for us to enter into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is through the judgment of God that we enter into His house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 16:8 says that the Spirit of reality will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He will exercise God s judgment on the world in a positive way, not that people may perish, but that they may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>True repentance is to be under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever a person repents, he places himself under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the experience of judgment can keep our spiritual life and our church life stable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A LIFE UNDER GOD S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A proper human life is a life constantly under judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to have a pleasant married life, both the husband and the wife need to live a life that is always being judged.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if a husband tries to justify himself all the time, he will have problems with his marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A basic cause of separation and divorce is self-justification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever a husband feels that he is justified, that he is right in every way and in everything, he will automatically condemn his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If she is one who has such an attitude, she will condemn her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, it will be impossible for them to stay together any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The husband justifies himself and condemns the wife, and the wife justifies herself and condemns the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This makes a pleasant married life impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But suppose the husband condemns himself and feels that there is nothing good in him, that not even his good intentions are acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, he remains under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he will say to himself, Whether or not my wife is wrong is not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My concern is to remain under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If both the husband and wife have this attitude, they will have a good feeling toward each other, and they will enjoy a very pleasant married life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church life we also need to be under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we justify ourselves, we shall not be able to stay in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more I justify myself, the more I shall condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, I shall leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who justify themselves and condemn others are not able to stay with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church God s way is the way of judgment.</S>
