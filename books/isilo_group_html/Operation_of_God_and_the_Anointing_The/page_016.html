<p>When we know that Christ dwells in us, we should consecrate ourselves to Him so that He can live in us and so that we will be well pleasing to Him. We also need to fellowship with Him so that He can operate in us. Then we will grow in life and be transformed into His image. In addition to these matters, which are within us, we need something from the environment, which is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The anointing is one aspect of our spiritual life, and the discipline of the Holy Spirit is another aspect.</p>
<p>The discipline of the Holy Spirit does not refer to the Spirit&rsquo;s ruling within us but to His disciplining us through the people, things, and matters that He arranges in our environment. Everything that we encounter in our environment has an element of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. There was a sister who was so particular about her clothes that she spent a long time getting dressed. One day while she was ironing a pretty dress, she had a sense to stop, but she ignored the sense and continued ironing. After ironing, she put the dress on and went out. As soon as she stepped out the door, a little dog jumped on her with its dirty paws, leaving a mark on her dress. This was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. While she was ironing, the Spirit operated within her, but she would not obey. Hence, there was a dog waiting for her at the door. This dog not only soiled her dress but also tore it. This sister was at a loss, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. This was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit often uses sickness, disobedient children, a complaining wife, a demanding husband, or even a cunning maid to discipline us. For example, through the operation of the Holy Spirit, a brother might realize that he should not serve the Lord in his own way, but he disobeys this sense. One day, however, the Holy Spirit might cause a maid to disobey him, and then he will realize that he also disobeys the Lord.</p>
<p>As one who served the Lord, Paul had many outward situations that caused him to mature in life. Paul was obedient to God; he did not need a &ldquo;little dog&rdquo; to deal with him. The dealing of the Holy Spirit with the sister mentioned above was negative, but the dealing of the Holy Spirit with Paul was positive. What befell Paul in Asia was beyond his power (2 Cor. 1:8). What he encountered in his environment was for him to experience the resurrection life within him. Hence, God did not deal with Paul merely for the sake of discipline; rather, God was providing an excellent opportunity for the divine life to mature in him. In order for wheat to ripen, it needs to be exposed to heat from the sun. Such exposure to heat is a dealing in the outward environment.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:2-7 Paul says that he was caught away to the third heaven and also into Paradise where he heard unspeakable words, which are not allowed for a man to speak. Because of the transcendence of the revelations, he was given a thorn in the flesh so that he would not be exceedingly lifted up. We do not know what this thorn was, but some people say that it refers to the weakness of his eyes (cf. Gal. 4:15). Whatever the thorn was, it caused him to suffer. Paul, however, says that there were two benefits from the thorn. One benefit was that it subdued him so that he would not be proud but would experience the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace, and the other was that it manifested his weaknesses so that he could experience the Lord&rsquo;s power (2 Cor. 12:7-9). Although he beheld the Lord and fellowshipped with Him with an unveiled face, Paul needed this thorn in order to mature in life. The thorn was an outward environment.</p>
<p>Paul was both defamed and praised; he received both evil reports and good reports (6:8). This means that while some people spoke well of him, others spoke ill of him. The more useful a person is in the Lord, the more he will be criticized. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, whom we mentioned earlier, is an example. Some people slandered her by saying that she was a witch. Those who are used by the Lord will be praised, criticized, despised, highly regarded, and reviled. They will receive both evil reports and good reports.</p>
<p>Paul had times of poverty and times of abundance. Because he experienced poverty, hunger, and abundance, he was able to enrich many, and he possessed all things (vv. 4-5, 10). These were adjustments from his environment. The life within him coordinated with his environment.</p>
<p>We should not think that we have no need of outward environments in order for us to mature in life. Even Paul needed his environment for the divine life to mature. He testified that his conduct in the world was &ldquo;not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God&rdquo; (1:12). This means that it was not easy for Paul to deal with the environment he encountered. Many people may use skillful maneuvering or play tricks in order to cope with their environment. Paul, however, was not like that; he relied on the grace of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Paul&rsquo;s outer man was persecuted, cast down, and afflicted, he was not abandoned or destroyed (4:9). We should not think that a life of following the Lord is one of ease and comfort, nor should we think that as long as we love the Lord, we will always receive material blessings. Because we have God&rsquo;s life, the world is an oven, a furnace, to burn us so that our vessels will be fit for His use. There is not one spiritual person whose biography portrays a life that was without any suffering from his environment. Such suffering is not only inevitable but also necessary. The world is a place of suffering. However, to the believers, suffering has a positive meaning. Some Gentiles might be spared from suffering, but for seekers of the Lord, suffering comes by the arrangement of the Holy Spirit for their discipline. For example, we might want to make much money, but the Holy Spirit prevents us from making money; we might want to be poor, but the Holy Spirit sends money our way. Do not think that being poor is a dealing but that being wealthy is not a dealing. Being wealthy can be a dealing.</p>
<p>Hence, on the one hand, our outward environment is in coordination with the divine life, but on the other hand, our outward environment is also a reflection of the divine life, showing the extent of our maturity. Having tears or complaints when we suffer is an indication that we are not yet mature. If we cannot tolerate being poor or being rich, we are not sufficiently mature. When we can bow our head and worship God in the face of suffering, poverty, or abundance, then we are maturing in life.</p>
<p>In order to pursue growth in life, we must know that Christ is our life, we must consecrate ourselves and love the Lord, we must fellowship with the Lord and be transformed into His image, and we must receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment. This is the way for the divine life to gradually reach maturity.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
