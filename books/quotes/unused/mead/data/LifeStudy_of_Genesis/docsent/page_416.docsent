   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY-ONE BEING DEALT WITH 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob's record in Genesis 30 and 31 is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based upon the two principles that the Bible contains no wasted words and that everything in the Bible is the word of life, we must look to the Lord that we might see the life in this record.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have spent a considerable amount of time in this section of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many years ago, I took this record merely as a story.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But after realizing that whatever is found in the Bible is the word of life, I began to seek the life in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After I was enlightened, I realized that this record is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the main items in 30:25-43 and 31:1-16, 38-42 can be classified under three headings: Laban's squeeze, Jacob's trick, and God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The three main parties in this record are Laban, Jacob, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two of these parties are visible and one is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Laban, the first party, squeezed Jacob, and Jacob, the second party, tricked Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither of these two parties, however, could make the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was made by the third party, the invisible party, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However much Laban squeezed Jacob, Laban was bound to lose, and whatever tricks Jacob might have played on Laban, it was not Jacob's tricks that made him rich.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The last word was not spoken by Laban or Jacob; it was spoken by God, the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would see the life in this section of the Word and receive the supply of life it contains, we must pay attention to these three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we see them, we shall appreciate this section of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have pointed out, Abraham represents a life justified by God and living in fellowship with God, and Isaac represents the life which enjoys God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Jacob we see the third aspect of the spiritual life transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob, a man under God's transforming hand, represents the life of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Laban's squeezing of Jacob was sovereign of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jacob needed Laban's squeezing hand, and God used it for Jacob's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As you read the record of Jacob's life, do not read it for others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Read it for yourself, for you are the unique Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even the sisters are Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While many sisters have Laban husbands, they, the tricky wives, are Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since they are so tricky, God has given them husbands like Laban to squeeze them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we may also say that many Jacob husbands have married Laban wives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nearly every husband is tricky.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although a certain married brother may appear to be a gentleman, he is actually a tricky Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every husband plays tricks on his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But however tricky we may be, God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob's record is our biography and autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The record in the Bible is our biography, and the record in our daily living is our autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are writing our autobiography day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In dealing with others, we are tricky; in suffering others' dealings, we are squeezed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jacob had been chosen to be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could such a supplanter become God's expression?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not by outward correction, but only through the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can transformation be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only by our being placed, by God's sovereign arrangement, into a certain environment and under the hand of certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is sovereign in His arrangement of our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To the brothers and sisters who are soon to be married I would say this word: Brothers, do not think that you are about to marry a good sister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, you will marry a squeezing Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sisters, be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will not marry a spiritual giant but a tricky Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is sovereign in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although God has chosen us, we are supplanters, heelholders, and must be transformed, whether we like it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have heard many among us saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you know what it means to say this to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means that you agree with His dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you say, "Lord Jesus, I love You," you are actually saying, "Lord Jesus, I'm one with You and I'm ready for You to deal with me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Probably you have not realized what is involved in saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose a young lady tells a young man that she loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This word involves a great deal and should not be spoken lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By speaking this simple word, she sells herself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, when we say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You," we are caught by Him and we become involved in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As many of us can testify, we had no problems before we began to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But since we began to say, "Lord Jesus, I love You," we have had one problem after another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These problems, however, do not kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes we may be plagued with so many problems that we want to die.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But at such a time the Lord will say, "You may want to die, but I will not let you die.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I will keep you alive that you might be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I did not predestinate you to die.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I predestinated you to be conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we approach this portion of the Word in this light, we shall see how living it is.</S>
