The first two chapters were spoken in Manila in June 1959, and the third chapter was given in Taipei in October of the same year
The disciples had been under the Lord's leadership and had gained a considerable amount of knowledge concerning Him
The principle of Christ is the mingling of God and man, and this God who was mingled with man is in us to be our life
If we have a desire to serve God today, we must have a considerable amount of knowledge concerning this matter of Christ's being life to us
Of just listening to some messages about life, we must see the vision of Christ as life and live practically by Him as life
Whether or not we can take Christ as our life depends on whether or not we are seriously willing to give everything of ourselves to Him
Reading from the Old Testament through the New Testament, you can see that those who loved the Lord intensely were strong
We need to look to Him, inquire of Him, and take counsel with Him in our daily life concerning all matters, whether great or small
When we fellowship with Christ and inquire of Him in this way, He will be our life practically in our daily walk
Although we can worship individually, we enjoy more precious and higher worship when we worship together with the brothers and sisters
As such, we cannot be detached from the Body, we cannot be Christians in an individual way, and we cannot serve the Lord independently
Losing the proper order indicates that we are still living an independent life and have stopped living the church life
The vision of Christ and the church is related not only to our personal growth in life but also to the building up of the church on earth
We know that the one book in the Scriptures which most clearly depicts the levels of our spiritual life is the book of Romans
In chapter five it tells us that those who have been redeemed and justified by God were formerly in Adam and had inherited sin and death
Only then can we become members of the Body of Christ in practicality, and only then will gifts and functions be manifested in us
Romans 12 shows us that even things in our daily life, such as showing mercy and loving the brothers, are gifts
Not only prophesying, teaching, and leading are gifts, but even giving, showing mercy, and loving the brothers are gifts
In Colossians 1 the apostle Paul said that he suffered for the Body of Christ to fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ
The first kind of suffering is the suffering for substitution in which He was judged and stricken by God for our sins
The early churches could not come into existence without the sufferings experienced by Paul and his co-workers
The apostle Paul said that his sufferings were for the church and his serving as a minister was also for the church
In all of our service in the church, we should bring Christ to people that they may receive Him and be built up in the church
If we desire to serve the Lord according to this vision, we must be prepared to satisfy the requirements of this vision
Compared to the glory which will be manifested to us in the future, the momentary lightess of affliction means nothing
We should not hesitate from going forward, considering the price to be too great and the afflictions too heavy
If we have seen this vision, no amount of opposition and hardship will be able to cause us to be shaken or to be disobedient
He said this to show us that in his living and in his work he did not do anything in himself, by his own strength, or by his own life
In the previous message we said that a person who serves the Lord must see the central vision of God in the universe-Christ and the church
If we have truly seen this central vision-Christ and the church-our entire being will be under its direction and control
On the one hand, we need to turn to our spirit to touch the Spirit; on the other hand, we need to come to the Scriptures to touch the word
Our emotions, preferences, opinions, ideas, insight, intelligence, ability, and capability are all our self, our natural life
We should learn this lesson not only in our daily life but even more in our work for the Lord and in our service in the church
Whether in ministering the word from the podium or in visiting people, we must learn the lesson according to this principle
After you have such a strict dealing, when you stand on the platform, you will be able to completely reject all that is natural
You will also be able to turn to your spirit to touch the Lord as the Spirit and to turn to the Scriptures to touch the Lord as the word
Whenever you go to visit people, you should always come back to your spirit and to the word to touch, to contact, the Lord
Brothers and sisters, if we take the Lord as life and live by Him, the result will be that we will be built by the Lord to be His church
Such a living is altogether the result of our living by Christ, taking Christ as our life, and allowing Christ to live in us
When you take Christ as life, allow Christ to live in you, and allow Him to live out through you, the issue will be the church
The relationship between you and the brothers and sisters will not only be horizontal but vertical, having the authority and the order
In the Epistles there are many verses telling us how the apostles took Christ as their life and how they lived by Christ
In such a living, there are some who teach, some who exhort, some who lead, some who serve, some who show mercy, and some who give
Whatever you do, however, you have to be coordinated with the brothers and sisters as members one with another
The reason for this insufficiency is that the brothers and sisters do not adequately take Christ as life or live by Christ
Since we live by Christ and thereby have the church life, we cannot be separated from one another and cannot be independent
Corinthians 12 tells us that the eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need of you,' nor the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you'
The apostle Paul shows us in Ephesians 4 that when Christ lives and grows in us, eventually we will become a full-grown man
The original text of this portion of the Scriptures does not refer to many full-grown men but to one full-grown man
We think that as we are in Christ individually and Christ is in us individually, gradually each one of us will become a full-grown person
Perhaps some will ask In John 12 did the Lord Jesus not say that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it will bear many grains
Are we members one of another with the brothers and sisters to the extent that we cannot live without one another?
If we feel that we cannot live without the brothers and sisters, that we need the brothers and sisters, then our living is the church
If we all live by Christ and allow Christ to grow in us, the result will be that we all will become a full-grown man
It seems that basically we do not know what a coordinated life is, what the church life is, and what the Body life is
The reason for this is that we always remain in ourselves and always try to preserve our wholeness, being unwilling to be broken
Brothers and sisters, the vision concerning Christ and the church is not a doctrine; rather, it is God's central purpose in the universe
Ephesians 5:32, a simple verse from the Scriptures, shows us that there is a great mystery in the universe-Christ and the church
In the Bible a number of mysteries are mentioned, but only this mystery, the mystery of Christ and the church, is a great mystery
Not only the purpose of God's creation is a mystery to the world, but even the church and the saints are a mystery to the world
Today people see that there are Christians and there is the church, but very few know why there are Christians and why there is the church
Unless God reveals the mystery hidden in His heart concerning the church, we, like others, cannot know what the church is all about
Strictly speaking, we should not pursue to understand and know the Bible; rather, we should pursue to know Christ and His church
God's purpose in giving us the Bible is that through His Word we may know the mystery which has been revealed-Christ and the church
Unless we have seen the vision of this mystery and thereby know Christ and the church, we cannot understand the Bible
We must be able to differentiate between our zeal and Christ, between our goodness and Christ, between our love and Christ
Many times when we see a brother who is zealous wellbehaved and full of love we think that such zeal goodness and love are what God wants
We have to see that what God wants us to know, pursue, and live out is not any of these things but rather Christ Himself
If we want to have Christ as our life and to have Him live out of us, we have no other alternative but to pass through the cross
To live out our zeal and our love, however, we do not have to go through the cross; we can live them out simply by our natural life
We must see that the cross has terminated our natural life, on the one hand, and released Christ as our life, on the other
We should not pay attention to such things as how to improve ourselves and how to do more good deeds and be more zealous
It is the case that with some brothers and sisters, their natural life becomes more prevailing even through their reading of the Word
In the beginning in the garden of Eden there were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In our Christian life we have the possibility of contacting either the tree of life or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
He will sacrifice and put aside everything that damages the church, regardless of how good it is, including his own spirituality
Of course, under normal circumstances, people being saved and the church being built up are one and the same thing
Under normal circumstances, the pursuit of spirituality builds up the church, but today the situation is rather abnormal
If you pay attention only to whether a certain matter is good and beneficial, and you neglect the church, in the end you will have regret
The church is a test to us to see whether the things we do are for the building up or the tearing down of the church
