   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution of the Triune God and the tripartite man in the Spirit of God and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place, and it is humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THIS IS THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD'S SELECTION IN ETERNITY AND OF THE WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF HIS OLD CREATION, REDEMPTION,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND NEW CREATION IN TIME</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What was presented above is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of the old creation, redemption, and new creation in time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these works of God in eternity and in time result in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN SUCH A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, GOD IS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BENEFACTOR AND MEN ARE THE BENEFICIARIES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One is the Benefactor while the others are the beneficiaries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both are also the satisfied enjoyers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God enjoys man, and man enjoys God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In conclusion, the Body of Christ is the Triune God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This multiplication and increase are God and Christ multiplying and increasing within us, the redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who have been graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</S>
