   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Expressed in Our Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we are found in Christ living Him as the God-man, He will be expressed in our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul s word in Philippians 4:8 indicates this: For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the items listed here are human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here to be true is to be true ethically, not in matter of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be honorable is to be venerable, worthy of reverence; it is also to be noble and grave 1 Tim 3:8, 11; Titus 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word implies the idea of dignity, which inspires and invites reverence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be righteous is to be right not just before God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be pure is to be single in intention and action, without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word lovely here means to be lovable, agreeable, endearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words well-spoken of are the translation of the Greek word that means sounding well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As used here, the word implies being of good repute, renowned, attractive, winning, gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this verse virtue is excellence, that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word praise indicates things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first six of these items are categorized as whatever is ; the last two are categorized as if any.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the last two are a summing up of the six foregoing items, in all of which are some virtue or excellence and something worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The point we would emphasize here is that these are human virtues in which Christ is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Doing All Things</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was a person in Christ 2 Cor 12:2 , and he desired to be found in Christ by others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here he declares that he could do all things in Christ, the One who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Christ to empower us means that He makes us dynamic inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ dwells in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By such an inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In particular, Paul could have all the virtues in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I can do all these things in the One who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that I can be truthful and honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am able to be right with God and man, to be pure, and to be a person who is lovable and well spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Christ I can have all the virtues that are praised by others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Philippians speaks of the reproduction of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whoever lives Christ, the God-man, is His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whoever lives Christ is a duplicate of the unique God-man, a reproduction of the prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Luke we see how Christ was incarnated and lived the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians we see how Christ is lived out from us in order to have many duplicates of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All Christians should be duplicates of the unique God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we be such duplicates, such reproductions?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we need to be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, and then we need to be gradually transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then spontaneously we shall live Christ, the God-man, by the bountiful supply of His Spirit, taking His mind and shining the word of life as luminaries reflecting His brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall also be found in Christ with Him as our surpassing righteousness, in the power of His resurrection, and conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we shall express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With the divine attributes of the God-man these virtues are strengthened, enriched, and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I trust that the Spirit will speak more to you concerning this.</S>
