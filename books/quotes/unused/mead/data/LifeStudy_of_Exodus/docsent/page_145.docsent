   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR DRINKING THE WATER OF LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 17:3a, 6; John 7:37-39; 4:10, 14; 1 Cor 10:4; 12:13, 3; Rev 21:6; 22:1-2, 17; Acts 2:17a, 21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider what is revealed in the Bible concerning the way to drink the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can testify that I have spent more than thirty years to find out how to drink the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message I pointed out that although I preached a great deal about drinking of the living water, I myself did not know how to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, I had to ask myself, You preach so much about drinking, but do you know how to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I had to admit that I did not have the way to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I came to realize the urgency of finding out the proper way to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What would I do if, after a message on drinking the living water, someone were to ask me how to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose someone approached you and said, I believe that Christ is the living water, and I am thirsty for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please tell me how to drink of this living water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How would you answer such a question?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not all the divine secrets in the Bible are revealed in a clear and evident way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His wisdom sometimes God reveals His secrets in a way that is rather hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These secrets are recorded in the Bible and revealed in it, but they are not altogether open.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, the Bible commands us to believe, but it does not tell us how to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For years in preaching the gospel I have told people to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever someone has asked me how to believe, I have been troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What would you say if someone asked you how to believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Would you tell that person in a doctrinal way that faith comes by hearing?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you simply tell him to believe, what will you do if you are asked how to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best answer to this question is that we believe by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To the unsaved we should not give complicated answers about how to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not try to explain that by believing we enter into an organic union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such explanations will only confuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tell those who want to believe in the Lord to simply open their mouths and call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way to believe in the Lord is to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as the Bible does not tell us how to believe, so it does not tell us how to drink the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scripture simply says that if we are thirsty we should come to the Lord and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we go to the Lord and ask Him how to drink, He may say, If you are thirsty and want to drink, just drink.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We learn to drink by drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the way to drink is somewhat like the way to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way to drink is not exactly the same as the way to believe, but it is close.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we consider how to drink, I would like to present in a simple yet practical way what I have learned through more than thirty years of study.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word is given to those who believe in the Lord, not to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I. POSITIONED TO DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As believers, we have been positioned to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the first aspect of the science of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through baptism we have been positioned to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we have been baptized into the Lord, we have the position to drink of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we were saved, we were far away from the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But now that we have been saved, we have been brought back to the water and positioned to drink of it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, there is a drinking fountain in our meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in order to drink of this fountain, our mouth must be in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, to drink of the living water, we must first be positioned to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Baptism gives us this position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that we all are positioned to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE NEED OF THIRST</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though we have been positioned to drink, we shall not drink unless we are thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To drink the water of life there is the need of thirst Exo 17:3a; John 7:37; Rev 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Millions of today s Christians are not thirsty for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a mercy it is to be thirsty!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I can testify that day by day I am thirsty for living water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I do not pray for a certain period of time, I become conscious of my thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a mercy that we are thirsty for the living water, especially when so many Christians have no thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many of us can testify that during the day we are conscious of the thirst within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This thirst causes us to pray and to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a simple way, we may say, Lord Jesus, I am thirsty for You, and I want to contact You.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we sense that our thirst is not adequate, we may need to pray, Lord, increase the thirst within me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need such a thirst for the Lord.</S>
