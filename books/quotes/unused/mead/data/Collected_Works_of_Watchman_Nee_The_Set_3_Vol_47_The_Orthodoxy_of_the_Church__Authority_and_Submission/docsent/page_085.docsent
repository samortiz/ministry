   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE NEED FOR A DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 24:1-6; 26:7-12; 2 Sam 1:5-15; 2:1; 4:5 5:3; 6:16-23; 7:18; 15:19-20, 24-26; 16:5-14; 19:9-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament David was the second king appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before David there was Saul, who was also appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David was the up-to-date authority appointed by God; he was God's present anointed one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Saul was God's displaced authority; he was God's previous anointed one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's Spirit left Saul, but he was still on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>David was already appointed the king, yet Saul would not step down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What should David do?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see how David submitted to authority and how he did not build up his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David was a man according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He could be a deputy authority because he was a person who genuinely submitted to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WAITING FOR GOD TO ESTABLISH AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Samuel 24 tells us of a story in the wilderness in Engedi.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Saul was pursuing David.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When David hid in a cave, Saul went into the same cave to cover his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David was hiding in the innermost part of the cave.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He cut off a corner of Saul's cloak, but later rebuked himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4b-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His conscience was very tender and keen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Samuel 26 tells us of another opportunity that David had to kill Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This time, however, he only took his spear and water jug v. 12a . David cut off a corner of Saul's cloak and took something in his possession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This could have served very well as a basis for him to boast to Saul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this would have been the way of a lawyer, not the way of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A lawyer is only concerned with reason and evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But a Christian is concerned with feeling; he is not concerned with reason.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is concerned with fact, not with evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David had the sense and feeling of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why he rebuked himself after he cut off a corner of Saul's cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should be those who are only concerned with facts before the Lord; we are not for politics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not pay attention merely to the procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both in Shanghai and Foochow I have seen brothers who were concerned only with procedures and evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But here was a man who began to rebuke himself after he had only cut Saul's cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian is one who is concerned with inward feeling, not with proof of evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those in the world are concerned with proof of evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person may be able to cut the cloak of others, he may be able to take their spear and water jug, and he may be able to boast of it, but his heart will condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David was a person who could submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not tear down Saul's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead he waited for God to establish his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was able to wait; he did not try to "help" God by hastening Saul's death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A deputy authority of God must learn not to establish his own authority, but to build up the authority of those who are over him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NOT BEING GOD'S CHOICE ALONE,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BUT ALSO THE CHURCH'S CHOICE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Samuel tells us of a person who came to David and reported that he had killed Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought that he would be rewarded, but David killed him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The man was wrong because he had annulled God's authority 1:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although he had not annulled David, David felt that it was wrong that the man had annulled Saul's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He judged any annulment of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After Saul died, David asked God to which city he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time the palace was in Gibeah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who among the Israelites did not know David?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as David knew of Saul's death, he should have gone to the capital with his warriors.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Humanly speaking, he should have hurried to Gibeah with his army.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was a golden moment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How could he let it slip away?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As far as common sense goes, he should have gone up to Gibeah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was good enough that he had been submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who did not know that David was a warrior?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But he acted strangely.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He inquired of God, and God told him to go to Hebron 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hebron was a small city and an unimportant one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time some came from Judah and anointed him the king of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows us that David did not try to seize authority by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He left it up to God's people to anoint him v. 4 . When Samuel anointed him, it was a mark that God had chosen him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the people anointed him, it was a mark that God's people a type of the church had chosen him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>David could not deny or reject the men of Judah's anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He could not say, "Since I have God's anointing already, why do I need your anointing?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is one thing for God to anoint someone, and it is another thing for His people to anoint someone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A deputy authority must be not only God's choice but the church's choice as well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No one can impose his authority upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He must wait for God's children to make their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>David did not go up to Gibeah.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, he waited for God's people to come to him in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He waited for seven years and six months.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Seven and a half years is not a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But David was not in any hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I have not seen one person who was full of self and desirous of self-glory who also was chosen by God to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God anointed David not only as the king of Judah but also as the king over the whole nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet as long as God's people did not acknowledge him, he would not come forward.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When only the house of Judah anointed him, he was satisfied to just be the king of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was not in any haste.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He could wait.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After seven and a half years, all the tribes of Israel came to Hebron and spoke to David, saying, "Here we are; we are your bone and your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even previously, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And Jehovah said to you, You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be ruler over Israel" 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The tribe of Judah first acknowledged him as king in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After seven years and six months, the elders of the tribes of Israel anointed him as king, and then he reigned in Jerusalem for thirty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In David we see that authority is not self-appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is not imposed upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Authority is appointed by God and anointed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>An authority does not proclaim himself the king, and he is not just appointed by God to be king.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>First, he is chosen by God, and then he is acknowledged by man.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>David was a real king.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In the New Testament, when David is spoken of, he is addressed as "David the king" Matt 1:6 , but Solomon is not addressed as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The New Testament gives special recognition to David's kingship because he did not trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He had God's anointing, and he waited for the anointing of His people, that is, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should have not only the Lord's anointing but also the church's anointing before we assume authority among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>David waited from the age of thirty to thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He did not doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He did not say, "What will happen if the children of Israel do not anoint me?"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He was humbled under the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Everyone who knows God can wait.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Those who know God do not need to move a finger to help themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you are in the right condition, not only will the Lord acknowledge you as His representative; the church also will acknowledge you as God's representative.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I hope that you will have not only God's anointing but the church's anointing as well.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You must never contend with your flesh or try to move your finger.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The flesh has no place here.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No one can stand up to proclaim, "I am God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You must all obey me."</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must first learn to have a spiritual ministry before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must wait for God's time before we can serve Him among His children.</S>
