   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THE BELIEVERS THEIR SYMBOLS 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover six more symbols of the believers: a lamp, a city situated upon a mountain, the sun, virgins, plants, and living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>F. A LAMP 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Placed Not under the Bushel but on the Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 5:15 the believers are symbolized by a lamp: "Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be the lamp shining upon others we need to be without any covering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 15 the Lord Jesus speaks about placing the lamp under the bushel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A lighted lamp placed under the bushel cannot shine out its light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety Matt 6:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of being covered by the bushel, we must be on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus wisely speaks about not being covered by a bushel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we Christians are anxious about our living and concerned about how much money we are making, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to shine upon others, we need to come out from under our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that, as kingdom people, we live without care and anxiety for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day after day we are a happy people, a praising people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When others contact us, they will sense that we have no anxiety, that we are not worried about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From experience we know that such a lack of anxiety touches others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If every time someone contacts you, you are happy and enjoying the Lord, he will be deeply touched.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Filled with anxiety and occupied with all kinds of worries, worldly people talk about the fear of losing their jobs or the difficulties they are having at work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the kingdom people, those not covered by the bushel, care only to talk about Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By being such a people we touch the hearts of others and shine upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Shining to All Who Are in the House</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 5:15 speaks of the light shining to "all who are in the house."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may think that the house here refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, there is no need to interpret the house in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The light as a city on a mountain v. 14 shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward but also inward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The outward shining of the kingdom people, likened to that of a city situated on a mountain, is general, and all of society can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Society can see a group of people who are built up, situated upon the top of a mountain, and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The inward shining, on the contrary, is particular.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When others see that we are not anxious about our living, the light of the lamp will penetrate into their being and shine within them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not the general shining from outside; it is the particular shining from within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are proper kingdom people, we shall be a lamp without any covering shining into others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This inward shining penetrates the inward being of others and convinces them.</S>
