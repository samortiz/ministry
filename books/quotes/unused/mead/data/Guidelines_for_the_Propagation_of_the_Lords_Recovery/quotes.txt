[1]  Guidelines for the Propagation of the Lord's Recovery CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE PURSUING THE TRUTH TO BE EQUIPPED OUTLINE The apostle Paul being a teacher of the truth 1 Tim 2:7.
[3]  The church being the pillar and base of the truth 3:15.
[4]  God desiring all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1.
[5]  The word of the truth being the gospel of our salvation Eph 1:13.
[6]  On the negative side, the poor condition of Christianity is also unprecedented.
[7]  By the Lord s mercy, after being immersed in the Bible for almost fifty years, in 1974 I was burdened to put my knowledge of the Bible into writing by holding two trainings every year, one in the summer and the other in the winter.
[8]  In every training we covered a book in the Bible, but books that are more profound and difficult, such as Ephesians, were covered in two trainings.
[9]  There is a spiritual famine throughout the earth just as there was a famine in Joseph s time.
[10]  However, the Lord s recovery is a storehouse filled with food, just as Joseph s storehouses were.
[11]  We have seen the need among God s children; therefore, we should rise up and distribute the food in our storehouse.
[12]  When I visited Taiwan in the past, I was not satisfied with our meetings, but this time I have a different feeling.
[13]  The outline of this message presents the following main points: the apostle Paul was a teacher of the truth 1 Tim 2:7 , the church is the pillar and base of the truth 3:15 , God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1 , the word of the truth is the gospel of our salvation Eph 1:13 , knowing the truth sets us free John 8:32 , God s word is the truth that sanctifies us 17:17 , we must build up ourselves upon our most holy faith Jude 20 , we must be fully equipped with the Scripture 2 Tim 3:16-17 , we must cut straight the word of the truth 2:15 , and the word of God grows Acts 6:7; 12:24 .
[14]  CHAPTER TWO GROWING IN LIFE TO LIVE CHRIST OUTLINE Growing in life: Needing to be rooted in Christ Col 2:7.
[15]  Enjoying the Lord and longing for the milk of the word in order that by it we may grow 1 Pet 2:2-3.
[16]  The workers planting and watering, but only God causing the growth 1 Cor 3:6-7.
[17]  We need to teach the saints the truth and to go and teach others the truth.
[18]  When we first came to Taiwan, we preached the gospel in one accord, and our whole heart was to preach the gospel.
[19]  We should not merely get excited concerning this goal.
[20]  Learning the truth is a must, and the only way to learn the truth is to study the Bible.
[21]  There are about one thousand two hundred messages in the Life-study of the New Testament.
[22]  We should read one message a day, and we should also read the Recovery Version of the New Testament with its footnotes and marginal cross references.
[23]  If we read six messages a week, we will read at least three hundred messages in a year and one thousand two hundred messages in four years.
[24]  Now we come to the main point of this chapter, which is growing in life to live Christ.
[25]  We first need to see what we mean by growing in life.
[26]  In order to grow in life we need to be rooted in Christ Col 2:7 .
[27]  This means that we should take Christ, not ourselves, as our foundation, our source, in all things.
[28]  CHAPTER THREE LOVING TO LIVE THE NORMAL CHURCH LIFE OUTLINE The church life: Christ as life living in all His members for His unique Body 1 Cor 12:12; Rom 12:5.
[29]  The Christian life not being an individualistic life but a corporate life 1 Cor 10:17; 12:14-22.
[30]  The church life being a meeting life that is communal, not isolated Heb 10:25; Acts 2:46; 1 Cor 14:23a, 26.
[31]  A young brother testified that he wants to preach the gospel in Africa.
[32]  I would advise him not to go and preach to the Africans yet but to stay in Taiwan and preach to the Chinese first.
[33]  Currently, while we are waiting for everyone to arrive and take their seats, some saints talk and others pray.
[34]  Then after everyone is seated, we wait for a brother to call a hymn, for another brother to read some verses, and for still another brother to give the message; then after the message we have a time for testimonies.
[35]  In the local churches, we did not follow this old custom of calling our gatherings worship ; instead, we called our gatherings meetings.
[36]  AND BY SPREADING THROUGH MIGRATION OUTLINE The commission of the gospel Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47.
[37]  The responsibility for the gospel Rom 1:14; 1 Cor 9:16-17.
[38]  We need to see the commission of the gospel.
[39]  Preaching the gospel is the greatest commission in the Bible, and it is the Lord s greatest charge to us.
[40]  After a person is saved, he does not need to be encouraged to preach the gospel, because there is a spontaneous desire within him to preach the gospel to others.
[41]  In 1 Corinthians he said, If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
[42]  He also feels that it is an offense to the Lord if he does not preach the gospel and that the Lord will judge him for not preaching the gospel.
[43]  In order to preach the gospel, we also need to be soaked with the Word of God through prayer and fellowship with the Lord 4:31 .
[44]  If we have the burden to preach John 3:16, we should spend at least half an hour to absorb this verse.
[45]  This verse says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.
[46]  Then when we use this verse to preach, we will not speak empty doctrine or dead letter; rather, we will utter the words with which we have been saturated.
[47]  After listening to John Sung preach the gospel, I came to the conclusion that his preaching was questionable in relation to the truth, but his way of gospel preaching was right.
[48]  When we preach the gospel, we must proclaim the Lord s name and lead people to call on the Lord s name.
[49]  The opposers say that calling on the name of the Lord is an erroneous doctrine.
[50]  However, in Acts 3 Peter spoke to the lame man who asked for alms at the door of the temple which was called Beautiful, and said, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk v. 6 . That man stood up and began to walk.
[51]  He entered with the apostles into the temple, and was walking, leaping, and praising God v. 8 . After this incident the Jewish rulers, elders, and scribes threatened the apostles and charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus 4:17-18 . We need to teach people to call on the name of the Lord, because the Lord s name is all-powerful, and it is in this name that we are saved vv.
[52]  We do not need to say this to people, but we need to say to the devil, Satan, you need to know that Jesus Christ has obtained all authority in heaven and on earth; He is the Lord of heaven and earth, and I am His representative.
[53]  In conclusion, in order to have the power to preach the gospel, we need to pray, enter into the Lord s word, and be released.
[54]  IN THE HOMES AND SMALL GROUPS OUTLINE The responsibility of the whole church coming together in one place 1 Cor 14:23.
[55]  We hope that by giving these messages the churches in Taiwan, especially the saints in the church in Taipei, will rise up quickly to preach the gospel.
[56]  In order to preach the gospel, we can have gospel marches, post gospel banners, distribute gospel tracts, and speak in every place.
[57]  Therefore, I am burdened to push the elders and co-workers to urge the saints to open their homes.
[58]  We need to speak until everyone is restless and rises up to preach the gospel.
[59]  After the saints open their homes, they do not need to hold a big gospel meeting or to invite many people to hear the gospel.
[60]  All the saints in the church in Taipei and in the Lord s recovery need to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel.
[61]  The leading brothers need to let the saints preach the gospel, especially the saints who do not know how to preach the gospel.
[62]  When we open our homes, we should also preach the gospel to the children, because almost every household has children.
[63]  There are not enough children in the children s meeting in Taipei.
[64]  There are many saints who want to serve full time.
[65]  After we sounded the call, over one thousand two hundred saints signed up.
[66]  Everyone in the church should participate in preaching the gospel, and we should also be able to match the gospel move with our material offering.
