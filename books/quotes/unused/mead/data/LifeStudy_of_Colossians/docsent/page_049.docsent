   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEART AND THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this verse Paul deals with two crucial organs of our inner being: the heart and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word understanding implies the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the heart has been hurt and has become cold and divided, it is easy for the mind to be distracted or even attacked by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the mind is in such a condition, it cannot understand the word that is ministered concerning Christ and God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Problems in the heart are often the cause of mental problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a person s mind is under attack by the enemy, this is an indication that his heart is wrong in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever the heart is wrong, it is easy for the mind to be in darkness or subject to attack.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most cases of mental illness have their source in problems that exist in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>More than forty years ago, the superintendent of a large mental hospital told me that, according to his experience and observation, mental problems are caused by problems related to greed for money and sex.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are problems of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Greed for money causes problems in the hearts of some, whereas lust causes problems in the hearts of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such problems cause the mind to come under attack.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through years of experience, we have learned that mental illness can be traced to problems in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mind is attacked because the heart is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps someone has a certain ambition or desire in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this ambition or desire is not fulfilled and is not dealt with, the mind may be attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul no doubt realized this; he knew that it was crucial for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted and knit together in love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If their hearts were cared for in a proper way, the saints would have the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their minds would once again function normally to understand spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When our hearts are comforted, our minds will function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if there is a problem in our heart, there will be a problem in our mind also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The heart regulates the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether the mind is normal or abnormal depends on the condition of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The relationship with the saints in the church life tests what is in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our hearts are possessed by certain ambitions, desires, and goals, our minds will not be normal and will cause us to have problems with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, if my mind is under attack because of a problem in my heart, I may be very displeased if a brother does not greet me with a smile.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I may be further troubled if this same brother invites another brother to lunch with him, but does not invite me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I may become quite angry over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This anger is not caused by temper; it is caused by the problem in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my heart I may desire respect, honor, and position.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This may cause me to feel that others should show respect for me by greeting me in a pleasant way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if I have no problem in my heart, I shall not be troubled if a brother does not smile at me or does not include me in a certain activity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our heart is right, we shall be happy in the church life, no matter what happens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if there is a problem in our heart, we shall be displeased with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FULL ASSURANCE OF UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the heart to be knit together with others in love involves the emotion, whereas to have the riches of the full assurance of the understanding involves the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not have a proper heart, we shall not be able to receive the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To see the vision of Christ we need a heart that is comforted, cherished, and knit together with others in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How happy I am that the hearts of the saints in the Lord s recovery have been comforted and knit together!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because our hearts have been knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, we can receive the revelation in the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The riches of the full assurance of understanding equal the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our hearts have been comforted and our minds function normally, we shall have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can see why Paul struggled for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He knew that this is the only way the saints can have the full assurance of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because our hearts have been cherished and knit together, we in the Lord s recovery have such an assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This assurance gives us the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord daily cherish our hearts that we may have a healthy church life!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our hearts are happy, it seems that all the brothers and sisters are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when our hearts are not happy, the opposite seems to be the case.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How important it is for our hearts to be cherished by the Lord!</S>
