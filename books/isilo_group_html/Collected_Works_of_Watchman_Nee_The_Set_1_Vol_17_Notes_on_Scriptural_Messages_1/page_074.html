To "run" means to not stand still, it means to not walk slowly. It means to run forward fast and finish the longest distance within the shortest time. In other words, it means to run fast. Since there are many competitors, one has to be ahead of others if he wants to win the crown. Whether or not we win depends on how fast we run. If we waste our time and linger about, we will surely fail.</P><P>We are running the race which is set before us. There is only one race, which is the race set before us. We cannot choose the race we want to run. We have to run what God sets before us. In a race, who would dare run outside of the track? Everyone must run inside the track that is drawn for him. This is what 2 Timothy 2:5 says, "Also if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully." Unfortunately, many Christians, though running zealously, are not running the race set by God. All our own zeal, labor, and activities can never replace God's will. All the running outside of God's will eventually results in loss. God has set the race before us. We must run this race in order to gain the prize.</P><P>Our feet have to run right inside the track drawn by God.  Our eyes have to be "looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:2). That means we have to look away from all other things and look to Jesus. We should not look at anything else but should look only at Jesus. Only when we look unto Jesus can we run straight. Many things around us may affect our vision and change our goal. Only by looking unto Jesus will we run the race from beginning to end.</P><P>He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith. Our faith is initiated by Him and perfected by Him. What we believe in is only Himself. Once we are in the Lord, we have to always abide in Him. We should set our mind only on the Lord Jesus. Even things like holiness, victory, perfect love, baptism in the Spirit, zeal in rescuing the perishing ones, spiritual warfare, and so on should not capture our hearts. All the "beginnings" and "endings" should depend on the Lord Jesus. Our faith should begin in Him and finish in Him. We must not look unto anything other than Christ. If we look unto Jesus only, things such as holiness and victory will spontaneously be manifested in our lives. But if we seek for anything apart from Christ, those things will only make our path crooked. In this spiritual journey, we must pray for revelation from God, so that we see that everything is in Christ. Forgiveness, justification, and regeneration are in Christ. Holiness, victory, the filling of the Spirit, and so on are also in Christ. Everything is Christ. He is the very beginning of the beginning, the very end of the end. He is the Alpha; He is the Omega. Everything of us depends on Him. Apart from Him, we cannot run the race set before us.</P><P>"Looking away" is the precondition of looking unto the Lord. Unless we look away from all other things, we can never look unto the Lord. Those who look around while running the race will never run well. They will either run into a wrong track or will stop altogether. Therefore, God does not want us to look unto anything else but Him. Furthermore, even looking back inside ourselves is a harmful thing in our spiritual journey. All kinds of introspection, self-analysis of our own feeling, self-consideration of our own progress, or even excessive concern about our own spirituality will hinder our progress. One of the greatest dangers in running the race lies in a subconscious introspection in the runners due to their anxiety over progress. The result is that we cannot look away unto Jesus. What is looking unto Jesus? Looking unto Jesus is not looking at ourselves. Looking unto Jesus is being drawn by Jesus from our inside world and joining ourselves to the One whom we are looking unto. Who is the Jesus we are looking unto? We look unto the Jesus who is the Author and Perfecter of our faith; He is the all-inclusive Jesus. The key to spiritual progress is to know in a proper way how to not look back on our own situation. Blessed are those who do not look at themselves. May the Spirit of God reveal to us what looking away means and what an improper looking back is.</P><P>Let us see how the Lord Jesus ran the race. He, "for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God." The Lord Jesus ran straight by looking unto the joy set before Him. What kind of joy is this? He Himself had said, "Good and faithful slave...enter into the joy of your master" (Matt. 25:21). This refers to the joy of His millennial reign. According to His holy nature, our Lord is submissive to God. But the Bible also reveals another side of the truth: God's reward and approval, especially the kingdom, exercised some influence on Him. Our Lord went through all the shame and the cross and never drew back because of the joy set before Him.</P><P>Why does the Bible say, "Jesus," the Author and Perfecter of our faith rather than saying "Christ" or "Lord Jesus" (the address after His resurrection)? We know Jesus is His name as a man. God wants us to look unto Jesus so that we will look unto His human aspect. He is submissive to God by His nature; this refers to His divine aspect. He despised all the shame, enduring the cross for the joy set before Him; this refers to His human aspect. This is why the Spirit specifically mentions "Jesus," to show us that the prize also had considerable effect on Him as a man. It is right for us to obey God out of love for Him. But on the other hand, since God wants to motivate us to serve Him faithfully by means of the prize, it is not wrong for us to serve Him faithfully for the sake of the prize before us.</P><P>Why did Paul "forget...the things which are behind and stretch...forward to the things which are before," and "pursue toward the goal"? His own answer was "for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward" (Phil. 3:13-14). The prize was the high calling of God, and Paul left all that he had for it. God is pleased when we serve Him faithfully for the sake of the prize.</P><P>Our Lord "endured" and "despised"  because of the joy of the kingdom. How about us? Brothers and sisters, have we ever left anything for the glory of the kingdom? Have we ever quit doing what we wanted to do or done what we did not want to do for the sake of the prize from God? If this joy captured our Lord, can it not capture us? Many saints, in ancient times as well as today, left all they had for the sake of the kingdom's glory and followed Jesus. How about us?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
