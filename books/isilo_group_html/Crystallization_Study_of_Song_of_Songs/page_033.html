These two armies are dancing in celebration of their victory. The country girl eventually attained the status of the Shulammite. The name <i>Shulammite</i> is not mentioned in the beginning of Song of Songs. Only in 6:13 is her name mentioned in a very extraordinary way. In this verse the Shulammite is likened to two armies, or camps, dancing.</p><p>This phrase <i>two armies</i> in Hebrew is <i>Mahanaim.</i> This is not a common word; it is a historical name from the Old Testament in Genesis 32:2. Jacob decided to go back to his fathers&rsquo; land when he could no longer stay with his uncle Laban, to whom he had fled from his brother Esau. By that time he had four wives and many children, servants, flocks, and herds. However, his twin brother Esau was still alive. Jacob was returning with the fear that Esau still wanted to kill him. As he journeyed with his family, there were no strong ones with him. There were only feeble ones, women and children. Jacob was very frightened at the prospect of meeting Esau. On the way &ldquo;the angels of God met him,&rdquo; and Jacob said, &ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim&rdquo; (Gen. 32:1-2).</p><p>After he saw the two armies of God, Jacob did a marvelous thing. He divided his wives, children, and the rest of his possessions into two groups, or &ldquo;two armies.&rdquo; He thought that if his brother Esau attacked one group, the other group could escape being slaughtered. This is full of spiritual significance. These two groups are not just the singular <i>army</i> of God but &ldquo;two armies.&rdquo; This means that we are more than conquerors. It also signifies a strong testimony. God does not want &ldquo;giants.&rdquo; He wants only the feeble ones, the weaker ones, the women and children. They can become His armies because the fighting is not in their hands but in His hands. He needs a people who are one with Him, a people who are submissive to Him, signified by the plaited hair (S.S. 1:11), and obedient to Him with a flexible will, signified by the neck with strings of jewels (v. 10).</p><p>When we consider how to arrive at the high peak of the revelation in Song of Songs, we should not trust in ourselves. We may think that because the apostle Paul was strong, he could do it. But the apostle Paul himself told us that he was less than the least among the saints (Eph. 3:8). He said, &ldquo;Who is weak, and I am not weak?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:29). All of us, like the seeker in Song of Songs, are country girls. We were not born in a palace but in the countryside. For the country girl to become the Shulammite was Solomon&rsquo;s doing. Solomon attracted, charmed, and captivated her. In Romans 9:16 Paul said, &ldquo;It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.&rdquo; We may think that we can run, but we cannot. It is Christ who can run. Paul also said, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20a).</p><p>Dear saints, when that day comes, all who are strong in themselves will be disqualified. Those who are counted as overcomers will be the weaker ones, the ones who wept with tears saying, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot make it. Thank You for releasing all these high-peak truths unveiling to us what we should be. We should be in the Holy of Holies, living within the veil. We should be in oneness with You. You are our dwelling place, and we are Your dweller. I want to attain to this, but I cannot do anything. I am just a little one, a feeble one.&rdquo; Such weaker ones who depend on the Lord will be counted worthy to be the overcomers.</p><p>There being two armies indicates that the country girl was not alone. An army indicates the principle of the Body. Both Tirzah and Jerusalem are buildings, not single pieces of stone. All these spiritual principles are here. We should humble ourselves and admit that we are nothing. Instead of worrying, we should change our feeling to praise. We can say, &ldquo;Praise You, Lord. What a joy that I cannot do anything! What a joy that You do everything and have done everything for me!&rdquo; Right away we will have plaited hair and strings of jewels around our neck, that is, submission and obedience to the Lord. We will no longer be stiff-necked.</p><p>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord said that those in Philadelphia had &ldquo;a little power.&rdquo; He admired their absoluteness and faithfulness to do what they could. If we are too able and too full of capacity in doing things, we are finished. Today the Lord is waiting. He is still calling for overcomers. If we say, &ldquo;Lord, I can&rsquo;t overcome,&rdquo; the Lord will say, &ldquo;My child, whatever you cannot do, I will do for you. I resist the proud, but I give grace to the humble.&rdquo; This is the principle of two armies (Mahanaim) dancing. Remember that these two armies were composed of Jacob&rsquo;s wives and children. Eventually, none of them fought against Esau. It was God who fought Esau by changing his attitude. Genesis 32 is a history of Mahanaim. Today we are the reality of God&rsquo;s armies (Mahanaim).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
