   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE TWELVE GOD'S ECONOMY WITH HIS DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; Lam 3:22-23; Jer 23:5-8; 31:33-34</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After spending more than sixty-six years in studying the Bible, I can testify that the highest peak of the revelation in the Word is the revelation concerning God's economy and God's dispensing to produce the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is very important that we have this view when we read the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Otherwise, we will not have a clear and proper understanding of Jeremiah's writing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, in this message I am burdened to give a word regarding God's economy with His dispensing in the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GOD'S GOAL THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible consummates with the revelation of the city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that the New Jerusalem is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The vision of the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the Bible, which has one thousand one hundred eighty-nine chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, are related in some way to the New Jerusalem as God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, because the Bible speaks of so many other things, in our reading of the Word we may easily be distracted and not see God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His wisdom, God does not directly say in the Scriptures that His goal is to have the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, knowing that the New Jerusalem is too wonderful for us to imagine, He reveals this matter by using the Bible with its plain words, stories, histories, types, figures, and shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By all these different means, He reveals His thought concerning the New Jerusalem and depicts the various aspects of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BECOMING ONE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND LIVING HIM FOR HIS CORPORATE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has an economy, and this economy involves a plan with many arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's aim in His economy is to have a group of human beings who have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This group of people is a corporate entity, the Body of Christ, to be one with Him and live Him for His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As God is expressed not only by the Body but also through the Body, He is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He is glorified, His people are also glorified in His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way God and man are one in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this oneness we, God's people, are not separate from God, but we definitely remain distinct from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are one with God in life, in nature, in element, in essence, and in constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are also one with Him in purpose, goal, image, and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, no matter how much we are one with God, we do not share His Godhead and will never share it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man remains man, and God remains God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yes, in the incarnation of Christ, God became a man, but He did not give up His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, He has reserved and preserved the Godhead for Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, man is still limited, and God still possesses the unique Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The group of human beings who are one with God in every way except in the Godhead is symbolized, signified, depicted, and portrayed by a wonderful, holy city the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to keep this vision before us as we come to the book of Jeremiah.</S>
