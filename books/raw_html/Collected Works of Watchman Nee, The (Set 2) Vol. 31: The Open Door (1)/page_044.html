<h2 class="head2">Canton</h2><p>To my beloved sister in the Lord, Mrs. X:</p><p>I read your letter of the ninth, and it reminded me of the verse: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." When I saw you in Hankow, your speech, attitude, and dress all told me how I should learn to be a faithful witness for the Lord. On the one hand, I love and respect you for your change; on the other hand, I marvel at the Lord's power and commit my family more zealously before Him and ask Him to change them also. The beloved in the Lord are more dear than sisters in the flesh. I always feel that seeing a brother or sister in the Lord, or even hearing their voices, can give me great blessing and joy. Even if there is a yoke we must bear together, it is always light. When the need calls for our laboring together, we will always find the Lord's leading in our labor. We should pray for and remember one another. If our loneliness satisfies the Lord and our loss contributes to the Lord's gain, we are willing to be lonely so that the Lord may fully capture our heart! But no matter how willing we may be, we cannot satisfy or enable Him to gain anything if He does not give us grace to preserve us. In Canton all the meetings except the Lord's table stopped on September 21 because there were frequent air raid drills and the roads were often blocked. Many brothers and sisters moved to Hong Kong or the countryside after August 18. There are only a little over ten brothers and sisters left in Canton. There are air raids every day, but thank the Lord for His special grace. All is peaceful. May you have peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Yu-zhi for me.</p><p>Sun Zhu Ming-seng<br />December 14, 1937</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Lin Town, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It has been twenty months since we said good-by to each other in Shanghai. Thank the Lord that He wants us to learn to walk on the narrow way during this time. There have been miracles, and sinners have been saved because the Lord is with us. This is all out of the Lord's mercy, and we thank the brothers and sisters for praying for us. The church in Yi- Lin has been affected by the war in that more and more people are losing their jobs. They are poor, cold, and pitiful. I can only do my best and pray for them before God. The village assemblies in the region of northern Kiangsu are doing better than the cities and towns. They do not have the fear of airplanes, and they also have their harvest. They are not in any real hardship. Brother Chiu has taken the farm back since his mother passed away; he does not have any problems making a living. Brother Yung-feng is now farming ten acres of land, and his son, Wen-li, is the principal of an elementary school. They can still eke out a living. Brother Yung-t'ung opened a tofu shop this fall, and his business is doing well. His second son, Wen-fu, is learning to operate a sewing machine here. His third son, Wen-tseng, is helping out in the tofu shop. The rest of his children are still in school. Everyone in the family is well. This is a summary of their individual conditions. Please continue to pray for them. Peace to you. Peace to Brother Nee, Miss Chang, Miss Liu, and all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Wu Wei<br />October 24, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p>
