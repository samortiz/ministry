[2]  1 Preface A Synopsis of the Book of Revelation Chapter One
[3]  In May 1925, Brother Watchman Nee moved to Lo-hsing Pagoda, Foochow, in the province of Fukien in China.
[4]  In addition to starting on the work of his book The Spiritual Man, he established the Gospel Bookroom and began publishing The Christian magazine.
[5]  We believe that the entire Bible is the Word of God, and every word of it is inspired.
[6]  A very grievous thought in the mind of godly ones is that men have despised and opposed His Word.
[7]  Although geology does not form part of our meditation, for the benefit of all, we will study the Word of God by the Lord's grace at the commencement of our meditation and will consider how perfect is His Word, so that we can silently behold His beauty in His presence.
[8]  If there are any incompatibilities between God and man, we would rather give up man and accept God.
[9]  After telling us that God created the heaven and the earth, Genesis goes on to tell us the condition of the earth after creation, and how He created light, air, the land, the plants, and the animals day by day.
[10]  In Hebrew, the original language, there are altogether seven words in Genesis 1:1.
[11]  God's inspired record does not say that at the beginning of time, God molded the heavens and the earth into being, or that He made them out of some elements.
[12]  The word bara is used three other times in Genesis 1 and 2: 1 "And God created bara great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good" v. 21 . 2 "So God created bara man in his own image" v. 27a . 3 "In it he had rested from all his work which God created bara and made" 2:3b .
[13]  Chalmers pointed out that the word was in "the earth was without form" should be translated became.
[14]  In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, but in the six days, God made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them.
[15]  Later, after an unknown period of time, the earth which was originally good became waste and empty, without any life whatsoever.
[16]  God then rose up to recreate the world; He restored the desolate world in six days.
[17]  Nevertheless, we can find many shimmering lights in the Word of God which will enlighten us concerning this question and which will enable us to have a little more understanding concerning the former world and the cause of its desolation.
[18]  And the fact proves that these remains have nothing to do with our world; since the Bible declares that all things made by God during the Six Days were very good, and that no evil was in them till Adam sinned...Since, then, the fossil remains are those of creatures anterior to Adam, and yet show evident tokens of disease, death, and mutual destruction, they must have belonged to another world and have a sin-stained history of their own, a history which ended in the ruin of themselves and their habitation.
[19]  This section is indeed hard to understand, for it contains many expressions which cannot be applied to any mortal man.
[20]  If the "king of Tyrus" were only a mortal man, how could we explain the things in verses 11 through 15?
[21]  How could the king of Tyrus have been in the garden of Eden or upon the holy mountain of God?
[22]  Mr. Darby said, "Verses 11-19, while continuing to speak of Tyre, go, I think, much farther, and disclose, though darkly, the fall and the ways of Satan, become through our sin the prince and god of this world." Dr. A. C. Gaebelein also said that the king of Tyre is a type of the last great sinner Antichrist , that behind this evil king, we see another power that is Satan; Satan was the power behind the king of Tyrus then, and he still is the god of this age now, who rules the nations of this world.
[23]  The first half of Ezekiel 28:14 says that he is "the anointed cherub that covereth."
[24]  The work of the cherubim is to lead men to worship the Lord Rev 4:9-10; 5:11-14 .
[25]  Therefore, his work in the beginning was also to lead the creatures at that time in the worship of God.
[26]  Now when Moses took seventy of the elders of Israel up the mountain of Sinai, "they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness...And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount" Exo 24:10, 17 .
[27]  This indicates that Satan enjoyed a very high place, right below the throne of God, and was very intimate with God.
[28]  Also in Revelation 12:10 we read, "Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."
[29]  Perhaps what was recorded in Ezekiel was the conviction of Satan by God and what was written in Revelation was the sending of Michael by God for the execution of that conviction.
[30]  From the New Testament we see that under the hand of Satan there are two living beings: 1 angels and 2 demons.
[31]  Revelation 12:4 says that the dragon's "tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth."
[32]  There are other clues concerning the sea being the place of detention for demons.
[33]  In the Septuagint Bible, the word "deep" in Genesis 1:2 is the same as "abyss" here.
[34]  We have said that these demons are probably created races who lived in the first world.
[35]  This corresponds to what we read in Genesis 1:2 because they originally lived on the earth.
[36]  After sinning, their bodies were destroyed by God; their habitation was judged by God and became without form and void.
[37]  Finally, on the third day when God restored the earth, He commanded the earth to come out from the water and called the gathering of the waters the sea.
[38]  From these biblical clues we see the original situation of the earth, the races who dwelt on the earth, the paradise, and the princes, etc. If we are not mistaken in our meditation, we can draw a conclusion concerning the first world and the cause of its desolation as follows: In the beginning of "time" as opposed to eternity God created the heavens and the earth.
[39]  CHAPTER THREE THE RECOVERY OF THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS
[40]  We have seen that in the beginning God created a perfect world.
[41]  In the book of Job, Job mentions the failure of Satan's rebellion in order to show that it is foolish to dispute with God.
[42]  "He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? which removeth the mountains, and they know not; which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble; which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars" Job 9:4-7 .
[43]  We should know that each of the six days is a twenty-four hour day.
[44]  In the Bible a day is often used to represent a period of time, such as "the day of the Lord," etc. But the six days are not six periods.
[45]  Psalm 104:5-9 speaks about how God created the earth in the beginning, how He then judged the earth, and how He finally rebuked the flood the third day's work in Genesis to restore the earth.
[46]  Jehovah "laid the foundations of the earth, / that it should not be removed for ever" v. 5 . This was God's original creation.
[47]  "Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: / the waters stood above the mountains" v. 6 . This was the condition after God's judgment over the various creatures then on the earth; this was the water that covered the earth in Genesis 1:2 compare with 1:9 . "At thy rebuke they fled; / at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
[48]  On the fifth day, after the dry land and the celestial bodies had been restored, God prepared to create living organisms to inhabit the earth.
[49]  "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven" v. 20 . God's commandment expressed God's purpose.
[50]  We do not know what materials God used to make fish and aquatic life.
[51]  Here God tells us His purpose in creating human beings, "let them have dominion."
[52]  Under God's judgment, he could no longer have dominion over the world.
[53]  Although Satan still retains his title of "the ruler of this world," the man created by God is endowed with a free will; he has autonomous power.
[54]  God established man, apart from the authority of Satan, to have dominion over the newly created living creatures and plants, and over all the earth.
[55]  For God to have ejected Satan would have been quite easy; but for reasons unknown to us, He wants man to be His co-worker to destroy the work of the devil.
[56]  We have seen that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, that later the earth became without form and void, and that God restored the earth and all the things on the earth in six days.
[57]  III."And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters" Gen 1:2 .
[58]  God could not rest in a situation that was without form, void, and dark.
[59]  Neither was He happy with a situation in which man was subdued under sin, death, and Satan.
[60]  In such a fallen, desolate situation, it would not have been a surprise if God had forsaken man.
[61]  Why did God still have compassion on something that was without form, void, and dark, which was not even worthy of His attention?
[62]  Although sinners cannot be reborn by themselves, just as the earth could not recover itself, although sinners cannot separate themselves from sin, just as the earth could not separate itself from the deep waters, although sinners cannot act righteously, just as the earth could not change from darkness into light, nevertheless, God Himself can rescue us.
[63]  The work of the first day was God's calling of light to come forth through His word.
[64]  Sin caused the eyes of man's heart to be darkened; it blinded the eyes of his understanding.
[65]  If man stands alone without any help, he will never know that his position is perilous and his future is perdition.
[66]  V."And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters" Gen 1:6 .
[67]  Through "the firmament," God has divided that which is pure from that which is evil and filthy, so that each may have its own place.
[68]  VI."And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so" Gen 1:9 .
[69]  God's work here coincides with "the third day" 1 Cor 15:4 , a number which indicates resurrection.
[70]  Although God did not eliminate the sea, He restricted it so that it could not go beyond its boundary.
[71]  As the earth came out from the waters, so the spirit is resurrected from within the flesh.
[72]  The flesh does not become the spirit, nor is it eradicated.
[73]  God "raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" Eph 2:6 .
[74]  The Lord Jesus was raised from among the dead and was seated at the right hand of God, "far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named" Eph 1:20-21 .
[75]  All of these lights were created by God "to rule" Gen 1:16-17 .
[76]  There is ruling power in the shining of the saints.
[77]  IX."And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so" v.
[78]  The work on the sixth day, like the work on the third day, was divided into two halves.
[79]  The living creatures on the earth were created on the first half of the sixth day.
[80]  The heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
[81]  In chapter one God spoke more than ten times.
[82]  If the Bible does not have Christ, it is a dead book.
[83]  If we examine the places in the Bible that are difficult to explain or understand with a view to Christ and put Him into them, we will receive extraordinary light.
[84]  The work of the first day is the first step of the redemptive work.
[85]  Without light coming into the world, God and man would never have the opportunity to meet.
[86]  Now we can see how the work of the first day and the Lord Jesus' coming into the world are the same.
[87]  God cannot grant grace at the expense of righteousness, nor can He save man without punishing sin.
[88]  God wants to save man, yet God also wants to punish sin.
[89]  But even if God could die for man, it would be an injustice because man committed sins, not God.
[90]  The cross of the Lord Jesus separated the people of the world.
[91]  When He was crucified, His cross forever separated the two thieves.
[92]  III.The work on the third day signifies the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[93]  In His work on the third day God caused the waters under the heaven to be gathered together unto one place, made the dry land to appear, and caused the earth to bring forth grass, herbs, and trees.
[94]  Originally the earth was covered by the deep waters; there was no sign of life, nor any life at all.
[95]  The earth was buried deep under the judging water of God.
[96]  Because of the death of the Lord Jesus, a Christian should realize in his spirit that his sins have been borne by the Lord, that his sins have been forgiven, and that they have been judged and punished in the Lord Jesus.
[97]  Through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the saints should realize in their spirit that they are not just forgiven sinners who should cringe nervously before God, but that they are beloved children of God.
[98]  Rather, we should be justified Christians, daily acknowledging the fact that God has reckoned us righteous before Him, not through any righteousness of our own, but through our new position afforded through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[99]  The ascension of Christ concludes His work on earth.
[100]  His ascension is based on His death and resurrection.
[101]  The meaning of His resurrection is the victory over everything that belongs to Satan's kingdom.
[102]  Ephesians 1:20-21 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named."
[103]  Satan is under His feet; he has no chance to defeat Him because Jesus is now the Lord over all and has become the Head of all things.
[104]  Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[105]  The most important thing is to have outward form.
[106]  For a saint to practically receive the Lord's life and express this life on earth is a kind of training.
[107]  In the work on the sixth day God created Adam in His own image and charged Adam to rule over the whole earth.
[108]  If we want to understand the Bible clearly, we must divide the Bible into different dispensations.
[109]  The revelation of God in the Bible differs according to different dispensations.
[110]  They think that the concept of God gradually evolved until it became bright and clear at the time of the Lord Jesus.
[111]  Before we go any further, we must first mention one verse in particular.
[112]  We know that in the seventh dispensation there will be one thousand years.
[113]  This is the millennial kingdom, and Revelation 20 clearly tells us that the dispensation of the kingdom will actually last one thousand years.
[114]  If we say that the seven days of creation mean seven thousand years because the Lord considers one day as a thousand years, then how do we explain the following clause which says that the Lord considers "a thousand years like one day."
[115]  We have previously mentioned that the work of the third day is divided into two halves.
[116]  The first half of the work is a type of the fourth dispensation, the dispensation of promise.
[117]  God gave the law to the children of Israel for them to bear fruit.
[118]  This series of messages by Brother Watchman Nee first appeared in The Christian magazine between 1925 and 1927.
[119]  It covers the first three chapters of the book of Revelation.
[120]  What a pity it is that God's children have the book of Revelation in their Bible but do not have it in their hearts!
[121]  It is the final message given by the Lord Jesus to His church, unfolding the relationship between Himself and His church, His Israel, and His enemies.
[122]  Genesis, the first book of the Bible, tells about Satan being cursed by God.
[123]  Revelation, the last book of the Bible, covers how Satan will be defeated in the future and how God will execute judgment upon him.
[124]  One will not understand it if he does not read it.
[125]  May the Lord give us more patience to read His Word and not give up the Word of God because of difficulties we may encounter, thus causing us to miss much blessing.
[126]  Clement of Alexandria thought that John returned from his exile after Domitian's death, which was in A.D.
[127]  In his book, Eusebius mentioned three times that John's exile was during the reign of Domitian, and he believed that it was in the fourteenth year of Domitian's reign, which was A.D. 95, when John received the Revelation.
[128]  He expounded on Revelation 10:11 "You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings" in this way: "John spoke in such a way, because he was on the island of Patmos and saw this vision; that is, he was exiled there by Caesar Domitian to do hard labor in the mines.
[129]  The interpretation of Revelation has always been a subject of debate among Bible interpreters.
[130]  The interpreters of Revelation are divided into three main schools: 1 the preterists, 2 the historicists, and 3 the futurists.
[131]  In this book we see the journey experienced by the church in the world and the glory she will receive in the future; how the remnant of the Jews are protected by the Lord, how they will go through the great tribulation, and receive the promised blessing which God promised through the prophecies; and how some Gentiles disbelieve, sin, and receive punishment, and how some of them turn to the Lord and receive their joy.
[132]  From this verse we can see that Revelation must be divided into three main sections.
[133]  But how do we divide the twenty-two chapters of Revelation into three sections?
[134]  Therefore, we must not consider this book to be merely "a book of symbols."
[135]  Though it has more than thirty symbols, half of them have been interpreted.
[136]  Since the whole book has only twenty-two chapters, it averages out to no more than one symbol per chapter.
[137]  We have seen that Revelation is a book on righteousness.
[138]  If we want to understand the function of its righteous nature, we must differentiate between salvation and reward.
[139]  The Bible as the Word of God has made a clear distinction between these two things; they are never mixed together.
[140]  What God has separated, no man can put together by force.
[141]  Even though a sinner may be corrupt to the uttermost, as long as he is willing to accept, that is, believe in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, he will immediately be saved.
[142]  After he is saved, as one who has been regenerated by God, he should develop the new life, work for the Lord, and serve Him faithfully so that he can receive the reward.
[143]  God is willing to save a sinner who has no merit, but God is not willing to reward a believer who has no achievement.
[144]  Before a man believes in the Lord, if he will confess that he is a sinner, and will come to Jesus, and will trust that His death on the cross is a substitution for him, he will be saved.
[145]  After we have seen the difference between salvation and reward, we come to a related question, that is, judgment.
[146]  Without judgment, how does one know who is saved and who is unsaved?
[147]  If anyone believes in the Lord Jesus as his Savior, the effectiveness of the judgment of the Lord Jesus on the cross for sin will come upon him.
[148]  One is the number of God, as Deuteronomy 6:4 says, "The Lord our God is one Lord."
[149]  When they are multiplied together, they make one, in the same way that God is three yet one, one yet three.
[150]  The seraphim praise God three times saying, "Holy, holy, holy" Isa 6:3 , and the four living creatures praise the Lord God three times saying, "Holy, holy, holy" Rev 4:8 .
[151]  The Lord Jesus appears three times Heb 9:24-28 : the first time He appeared for redemption v. 26 ; the second time He appears at the right hand of God for intercession v. 24 ; and the third time He will appear to His people who are waiting for Him for the redemption of their bodies v. 28 .
[152]  Six is the number of the devil and also the number of man.
[153]  Because man sinned and listened to the devil's speaking, man is joined to the devil.
[154]  It has seven visions; there are seven praises to the Lord God and the Lamb; before the throne of God there are seven Spirits; there are the seven golden lampstands, seven stars, seven lamps of fire; the Lamb has seven horns and seven eyes; there are seven seals, seven angels blowing seven trumpets, seven thunders; the beast has seven heads and seven crowns on the heads; there are seven bowls pouring out God's last seven plagues, and seven mountains standing for seven kings.
[155]  The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the first of the seven days which is the eighth day.
[156]  Seven is four plus three, the creature man joined to the Creator God .
[157]  Twelve signifies that God bestows grace on man and receives him so that the creature is mingled in with the Creator.
[158]  Recently, in the study of prophecies, many who have adopted the theory of equating a day to a year have caused a bad impression to be formed in the believers about this theory.
[159]  Bible interpreters who use the year-day theory often try to interpret the various numbers in the Bible by equating a day to a year.
[160]  They even predict the date when the Lord Jesus will return, which is contrary to our Lord's announcement on earth that the date of His second coming is not known to anyone.
[161]  The first three chapters of Revelation mainly speak of the things pertaining to the church.
[162]  Peter says, "No prophecy of Scripture is of one's own interpretation; for no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit" 2 Pet 1:20-21 .
[163]  "In distressful times" in the original text can also be translated "in short times."
[164]  This probably means the seven weeks because it is shorter than sixty-two weeks.
[165]  The rebuilding of Jerusalem is during the seven weeks, that is, forty-nine years.
[166]  If we look at the last prophecy in Daniel chs.
[167]  10 12 , we shall see that this last prophecy coincides with the former ones.
[168]  "And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the water of the river, as He lifted up His right hand and His left hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever that there would be a time and times and half a time; and when the shattering of the power of the holy people is completed, all these things will be completed...And from the time that the daily sacrifice is removed and the abomination that desolates is set up, there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days...the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days!
[169]  The Lord Jesus continued: "For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" v. 21 . This statement is also a quotation from Daniel: "And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered" Dan 12:1 . That day will be a time of great distress.
[170]  Now we can look at another portion, which are the prophecies of Paul.
[171]  We want to see how this section of the Word corresponds with the previous words.
[172]  "Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
[173]  Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth that he is God" 2 Thes 2:1-4 .
[174]  The Lord Jesus also prophesied on this point concerning Antichrist the man of sin, the son of perdition , how he exalted himself above all and opposed the Lord.
[175]  When we read Revelation, we see a beast Daniel's little horn : how he is greater than the ten horns 17:12-13 , how he speaks great things and blasphemies 13:5 , how he persecutes the Jews v. 7 , how he opens his mouth in blasphemies against God v. 6 , and how power is given unto him to continue forty-two months v. 5 . Here again we have the correspondence.
[176]  All that we have spoken concerns how Revelation corresponds to the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments.
[177]  We have talked about how Revelation and all the other prophecies in the Bible confirm one another.
[178]  Revelation, however, does not only repeat what has been said in the past or declare again what was spoken of by the prophets before.
[179]  Not only will we see God destroying sinners in this way, but having seen how Antichrist will perform miracles, God will also perform miracles to oppose the devil and to manifest His own Godhead.
[180]  5-7 The Testimony of God v. 8 John on the Island of Patmos v. 9 The Vision of the Glorious Christ vv.
