<P>We can use electricity as an illustration of this. The power plant is far away from the electrical lights in a building, yet these lights are one with the power plant when they are turned on. In a sense, they are in the power plant because they are experiencing the electricity at the power plant. Apparently, we are here on this earth. But actually, we are all in heaven when we turn ourselves to the spirit.</P><P>We do not have two Christs&#151;one in our spirit and the other in the third heaven. The One sitting at the right hand of God in the third heaven is the very One in our spirit. The same electricity can be simultaneously in the power plant and in a distant building. In the same way, Christ is in the third heaven interceding for us, and He is also in our spirit. While He is interceding for us, He is talking with us. Many times while we are speaking, He is speaking in our speaking. We are being built into the habitation of God in spirit. Our spirit is the gate of heaven.</P><P>May the Lord open our eyes to see this. We do not need any admonishing or exhorting to be good. We need the message from Romans 7 and 8 to see how ugly our flesh is. There is nothing good in our flesh, yet it is still here to help us turn to Christ in our spirit. Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin crushed the sinful flesh. In resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit. He has come into us and is indwelling our spirit to impart life to us. He is strengthening, supporting, and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. At the same time, He is in the third heaven interceding for us.</P><P>After listening to this fellowship, do not make up your mind to do anything. This never works. You have to see the vision concerning the flesh. You have to see a clear view of Christ as the Spirit in your spirit. Do not pray, "From now on I will make up my mind. I will never walk according to the flesh. I will never lose my temper. I will never be a shame in the eyes of my wife." That is a satanic prayer in the realm of the tree of good and evil. That is not a prayer by Christ interceding for us. We simply need to turn to the Lord in our spirit. Then He will become more and more real to us. Then we can tell the Lord, "You are my world. You are my kingdom. You are my sphere. You are my realm. Hallelujah, Lord Jesus! You are everything to me." Then the Lord will be happy, and He will become more to you in your experience for the fulfillment of His economy.</P>
