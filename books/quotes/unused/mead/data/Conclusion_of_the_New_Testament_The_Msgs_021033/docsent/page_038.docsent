   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One Enthroned for God s Administration</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another aspect of Christ in ascension is that He is the One enthroned for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For Christ to be seated at the right hand of the throne of God does not mean that He is seated next to the throne of God, at God s right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation we see that there is only one throne of both God and Christ Rev 3:21; 22:1, 3 , one throne for both God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ has been enthroned in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His ascension was for His enthronement for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the book of Revelation, the throne on which the ascended Christ is sitting is the throne of the divine administration: I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne carrying out God s administration over the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus has been enthroned to execute God s governmental operation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the Lamb with the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, He is carrying out God s administration for the accomplishment of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In ascension Christ is also the Ruler of the kings of the earth Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Ruler of the kings He is far above all earthly rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even all the kings and presidents are under His rule.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords Rev 19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the Ruler of all the ones who are in power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the chief Ruler in the divine government for the fulfillment of God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leader and Savior</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 5:31 says that God has exalted Christ to His right hand as a Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word rendered Leader is archegos, meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word is used only four times in the New Testament and always in reference to Christ Acts 3:15; Heb 2:10; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought is that this One is the origin and Originator, the Author, the Leader, and the Inaugurator.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is above all and spontaneously is the Ruler with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has exalted Jesus, the One rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His being the Leader is a matter related to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God s chosen people to receive His salvation Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One God has exalted to His right hand is also the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ was on earth, He saved Peter, John, and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, although the title Savior is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry John 4:42 , He was not officially the Savior until His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were saved officially by the Christ on the throne, by the One in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we were saved, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ has saved us from the throne and to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the ascended Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord of All</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In ascension Christ is Lord of all Acts 2:36; 10:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As God, Christ was the Lord all the time Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as man He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In ascension Christ was made the Lord of all to possess all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Acts 10:36 Peter speaks of Christ as the One who is Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All refers here to all men, all peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ in His ascension is the Lord not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is the Lord of all the different races and peoples on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acts 2:36 tells us that Christ was made Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have seen, He was Lord before His ascension, but He was not officially inaugurated into this office.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One of the Old Testament names for God is Lord Heb, Adonai , meaning master.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ in the Old Testament was Adonai.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then He became a man, a despised Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This very One was Lord even when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But it was not until His ascension that He was inaugurated into His lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ in His ascension was inaugurated as Lord of all, not only of all men, but also of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the Lord, Christ now possesses the whole universe, God s chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the Lord not only of God s chosen people, but also of the angels and of all those who will be in the millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything and everyone He has redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In ascension He is the Lord of all to possess all.</S>
