   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This leads us to an important question which needs our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the work of the Holy Spirit within man?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What do we know about His engraving work in man?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that the Spirit of God not only resides in man but is doing an engraving and constituting work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This constituting work of the Holy Spirit is something that can never be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit is in man and is one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now He is engraving something into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should never consider that the Holy Spirit's indwelling is like a guest taking hospitality in someone else's house, residing for ten or twenty years and then leaving everything in the same condition when he leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No. The Holy Spirit does an engraving, building, and constituting work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Little by little the Holy Spirit constitutes the Lord's character in man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even a house takes on the characteristics of its occupants after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The enduement of gifts upon a person may not produce any change in the person, but the indwelling of the Holy Spirit will surely manifest heavenly character traits when the Spirit bears fruit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The very fruit of the Spirit is the changes that are produced in a man's character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God reconstitutes man's character through the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Spirit operates in man's mind, He changes man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Spirit operates in man's feelings, He changes man's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Spirit operates in man's opinions and judgments, He changes man's opinions and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit works and constitutes something in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of this work is a change in man's character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul did not serve as a minister of God's word merely because he afforded the Spirit the freedom to speak through him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit actually took up his very character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fruit of the Spirit in the Divine Trinity is the very product produced in man's character.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit operates in man, a little today and a little more tomorrow, engraving and trimming more and more each day, until a certain character emerges.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This character is distinctly man's, yet at the same time, it is distinctly a work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The character fully belongs to man, yet at the same time, it is fully begotten of the Holy Spirit; it is the result of the Spirit's work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Spirit builds up something in man, there is a transforming change in man from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that transformation is a basic truth as well as a fundamental experience in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Philippians 3 speaks of one kind of fundamental experience, and 2 Corinthians 3 speaks of another kind of fundamental experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We readily admit that our flesh will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But at the same time, we believe that the Lord will transform us; He will create a new character in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit of the Lord does not reside in us like a man residing in a house; He is in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is unthinkable that the Lord could dwell in a man, being his life for ten or twenty years, yet the man would remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord's Spirit abides in us and becomes our life, our mind, feelings, judgments, and opinions all have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our heart and spirit have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly there was nothing within us except the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the cross has dealt with the flesh and overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a new constitution and new fruit in our feelings, thoughts, and judgments, as well as in our heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What then is the constitution of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is what results from God's building and constituting work within man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will never go away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should realize that the Lord's work within man is always solid, firm, and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul received mercy from the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord continued to work in him until he became a faithful one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His faithfulness refers to his attitude towards his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He admitted that he did not have the Lord's commandment, yet he told the Corinthians his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His opinion was the result of the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul's words were no ordinary inspiration; they were the issue of an inward constitution by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end, these words of constitution became words of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a man is under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he is conscious of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a man speaks under the constitution of the Holy Spirit, he may not have the consciousness that God is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may feel that he is speaking and expressing his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But because the constitution of the Holy Spirit has been wrought into him, his words become the words of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason that Paul said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need the Spirit's engraving work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need Him to work on us to the extent that our opinions, words, thoughts, and feelings no longer contradict God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When this happens, we are qualified to be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The character which the Holy Spirit constitutes within man is different from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul's preaching carried his distinctive features.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter's message carried his distinctive flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His Epistles are very different in style from Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>John's writings are also different from others' writings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone has his own style.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The styles are personal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet it is an amazing fact that the Spirit would take up the style of those who have been constituted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the sixty-six books of the Bible were all one style, the Bible would be very dull indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's glory is manifested in man's various styles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This can only happen when there is the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A word may be uttered in different ways, but it remains the word of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a man submits to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he is given the freedom to express his characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No two items in God's creation are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every blade of grass is different.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every tree is different.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No two faces are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The glory of one star is different from the glory of another star.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the same way, the constitution of the Holy Spirit is different in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul was full of the love of the Spirit, and so was John.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But those who have been taught by God know that the Spirit's love as manifested in Paul was different from that which was manifested in John.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They each expressed the love of the Holy Spirit, but in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God does not need uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everyone has his own characteristics, and the constitution of the Holy Spirit is different in everyone.</S>
