   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-SIX EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 2 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Redeemer and the Propitiation Place</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Romans 3:22-26 Christ is presented as the Redeemer and the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>a. The Believers Being Justified by God and Receiving</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>the Righteousness of God through His Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 3:22-24 reveals that we may enjoy and experience Christ as the Redeemer: Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These verses show that the believers are justified by God and receive the righteousness of God through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For us to be justified by God means that we are approved by God according to His standard of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how righteous we may be in ourselves, we cannot be approved by God according to our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our righteousness will never justify us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but that does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when God justifies us, we are approved by God according to the standard of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers are justified by God on the basis of the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 3:24 speaks of being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To redeem is to purchase back at a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We originally belonged to God but became lost through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The requirements of God s holiness, righteousness, and glory were so great upon us that it was impossible for us to fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, God paid the price for us through Christ, repossessing us at a tremendous cost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ died on the cross to redeem us Gal 3:13; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18 ; His blood obtained eternal redemption for us 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since Christ has paid the price for our sins and in His redemption has fulfilled all of God s requirements on us, God, because He is just, must justify us freely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God can justify us because the work of justification is based upon the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because God is righteous, He must have a proper ground on which to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apart from Christ s redemption, God would not have the ground on which to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, Christ s redemption is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ s redemption is the basis of God s justification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The redemption of Christ enables us to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ, which meets all His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the redemption of Christ not only are the believers justified by God, but they also receive Christ as the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 3:22 speaks of the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians say incorrectly that they have the righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ Himself as a person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made the righteousness of God to us 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we should declare, Christ is my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My righteousness before God is the living person of Christ, not an attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The righteous Christ is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has made Christ, who is the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The righteousness of God is not only God Himself in His justice and rightness, and it is not only the living person of Christ; it is also we who have been made one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that the believers are made the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse does not say that the believers are made righteous; rather, it says that they are made righteousness, the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can become the righteousness of God by having Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the embodiment of God, and God, as a living person, is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, righteousness, God, and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The righteousness of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since this God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The living person of Christ as God s righteousness has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Him 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have been mingled together with Christ as one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we have become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must proclaim, I am the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is righteousness, and I also am righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am fully justified.</S>
