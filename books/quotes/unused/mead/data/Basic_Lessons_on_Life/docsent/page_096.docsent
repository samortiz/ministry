   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOUL NEEDING TO BE BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT THE SPIRIT MAY BE DIVIDED FROM IT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS THE JOINTS NEED TO BE BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THAT THE MARROW MAY BE DIVIDED FROM THEM</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the joints are not broken but are whole, the marrow can never be divided from the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to divide the marrow from the joints, we have to break the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that without our soul being broken, our spirit can never be separated from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for the contents to be divided from its cover, its wrapping, the cover must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our soul must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we let our soul remain whole, there is no possibility for our spirit to be divided from it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To discern the spirit means not only to realize the difference between the spirit and the soul but also to divide the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there is the need of the breaking of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOUL THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL NEEDING TO BE DENIED</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The soul is composed of the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these components of the soul need to be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not give any ground to our mind, our emotion, or our will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They all have to be denied in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE DENIAL OF THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING THE DENIAL OF THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To deny our mind, emotion, and will is to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus told us that to follow Him we need to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 16:26 compared with Luke 9:25 shows that our soul, our soulish life, is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The soul is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, to deny the contents of the soul the mind, emotion, and will is to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have to see that the denial is the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To deny the mind, emotion, and will of our soul is to let the soul be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real breaking of the soul is the denial of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>V. THE LIVING AND OPERATIVE WORD OF GOD EXPOSING AND DISCERNING THE THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OF THE MIND, THE INTENTS OF THE WILL,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND THE DESIRES OF THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the context of Hebrews 4:12, we can see that the living and operative word of God exposes and discerns the thoughts of our mind, the intents of our will, and the desires of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the word of God exposes our inner situation, it discerns our entire inner situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because the word of God is living and operative.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be living refers to the nature of God's word, and to be operative refers to the function of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word itself is living, and it operates, functions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the saints, including the older ones, need to understand why Paul mentioned the word of God for the dividing of our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because every time God speaks to us, His word always exposes and discerns our inner situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hebrews 4:12 is mentioned based upon the fact that God spoke to the children of Israel, charging them to go on directly into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What God spoke to them exposed their inner situation and made their inner situation clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The children of Israel were absolutely in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were considering how tall and strong the Canaanites were and how weak they were.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Canaanites were giants and big in number, and the children of Israel were small in number.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They were considering all these things and were afraid of the Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This consideration, this thinking, was in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the word of God exposed and discerned this to show them that they were in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They did not exercise their spirit like Joshua and Caleb did.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Joshua and Caleb did not remain in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible says that they had a different spirit Num 14:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were exercising their spirit, so they had the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul compared the staggering Hebrew believers to the children of Israel in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To Paul's registration the Hebrew believers were staggering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were not clear what to do, whether to remain in Judaism or to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They were in their soul not in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So Paul spoke the word of God to them to expose their inner situation and to help them to discern that they were in the soul not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By this we can see that every time we read the word in the Bible in a living way, the word always either requires or demands something of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This demanding word, or requiring word, always exposes and discerns our inner situation so that we know whether we are in the soul or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To discern our spirit, we need to receive the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more we pray-read the Word, the more it becomes living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This living word shows us where we are, in the spirit or in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is by this that our soul is exposed and our spirit is discerned from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word of God always shows us our inner position and inner situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are to discern the spirit from the soul, we cannot stay away from the living and operative word of God.</S>
