   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Longing within Them unto Envy for God against Worldliness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James 4:4-5 reveals that the Spirit within the believers longs unto envy for God against worldliness: "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here James uses marriage to illustrate our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the Husband, and we are His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God's counterpart, we should love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we love anything or anyone in place of Him, we become adulteresses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The indwelling Spirit whom God has put within us longs to keep us singly for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we would not be solely for Him but would love the world, this indwelling Spirit will not only be offended but also envious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the correct understanding of what James means when he says that the Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as a husband longs to envy over his wife, so the Spirit longs unto envy for God concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us to love anything worldly is to have another husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Worldliness replaces God as our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indwelling Spirit always envies when He sees us loving something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we love the world or any material thing other than God, the indwelling Spirit envies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He longs to see us loving God absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a husband sees his wife loving someone else other than him, this husband longs to envy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God as the indwelling Spirit is our Husband and He longs to envy when He sees that we love something, someone, or some matter other than Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This requires us to deal with whatever we love other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the indwelling Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit works in this way that we may receive the unique dispensing of the Triune God into us for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>34.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Sword for Them to Fight against the Power of Darkness and the Evil Things</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The indwelling Spirit is the sword for the believers to fight against their spiritual enemies, the power of darkness and the evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul speaks of "the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The antecedent of the word "which" is Spirit, not sword.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among the six items of God's armor, only the Spirit as the sword is the one for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With this sword we cut the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sword, the Spirit, and the word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if this word is only printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for "word" in Ephesians 6:17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the logos, the constant word in the Bible, becomes the instant rhema, this rhema will be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This rhema which becomes the Spirit is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But apart from the Spirit, the Bible is merely dead letters to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit makes the letters of the Bible the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the Spirit is the word of God, and such a Spirit is a sword, a weapon, for us to fight the battle against God's enemy to bring in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting against the enemy, we must come to the word of the Bible, receiving the word by means of all prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By praying with the Scriptures in this way, the Spirit within us becomes the sword by which we slay all negative things.</S>
