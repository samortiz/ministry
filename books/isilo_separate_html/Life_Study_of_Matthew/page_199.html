By God&rsquo;s Gift</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;The disciples say to Him, If the case of the man is thus with the wife, it is better not to marry.&rdquo; Now the disciples realized that according to God&rsquo;s ordination, marriage is the strictest bond. Once one is married, he is fully bound, without any way to be released, unless the other party commits fornication or dies. It was such a realization that caused the disciples to think that it was better not to marry. But it is not up to them.</p><p>In verse 11 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;Not all men can accept this word, but those to whom it has been given.&rdquo; Not all men, but those to whom God has given the gift, are able to refrain from marriage. Without God&rsquo;s gift, any attempt to remain unmarried will meet with temptations.</p><p>Verse 12 continues, &ldquo;For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother&rsquo;s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Those who are made eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens are those to whom God has given the gift not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. Paul was such a one (1 Cor. 7:7-8; 9:5).</p><p>In ourselves we are not able to keep God&rsquo;s original ordination. For this, we need grace; we need God&rsquo;s gift. Only those who have received the gift of grace can accept the Lord&rsquo;s word regarding God&rsquo;s original ordination.</p><p>A eunuch is one who deals thoroughly with lust. In order to be such a spiritual eunuch, we need grace. Only grace can afford us the strength and the supply to have a thorough dealing with lust. Lust is a great problem in our life. Because in ourselves we are not able to deal with this &ldquo;scorpion,&rdquo; we need to look to the Lord and pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me and grant me the grace I need.&rdquo; By grace it is possible to deal with the subtle, evil &ldquo;scorpion&rdquo; of lust that damages our life.</p><p>Lust damages not only the kingdom life and the church life, but also human life. It ruins marriages and society. It damages the spirit, mind, and body. Anyone who is under the dominion of the &ldquo;scorpion&rdquo; of lust will be ruined for the proper human life, family life, social life, church life, and kingdom life. Lust damages every kind of life. The corruption in today&rsquo;s society mainly comes from lust. If lust is dealt with, most of this corruption will disappear. We in the church life must deal with lust in a serious way. For this, we must depend on the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p><p>The religionists&rsquo; temptation here afforded an opportunity for the Lord to unfold a further matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens. Chapter eighteen reveals how we must deal with the brothers that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas chapter nineteen reveals that firstly married life (vv. 3-12) and then our attitude toward riches (vv. 16-30) are related to the kingdom of the heavens. Married life involves lust, and our attitude toward riches involves covetousness. The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE KINGDOM BLESSING<br />COMING THROUGH HUMILITY</h2><p>When the disciples rebuked those who were bringing some little children to the Lord, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Permit the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (19:14). Then He laid His hands on them. Here the Lord stresses again that to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be like little children.</p><p>On the surface, 19:13-15 seems to deal with an insignificant matter. Actually, these verses are concerned with pride. The Lord seemed to be saying to His disciples, &ldquo;You should not reject these little ones. On the contrary, you must become a little one yourself. Pride is hidden within you. You must condemn and reject your pride. If you reject your pride and become as little children, you will be in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo;</p><p>Matthew placed the dealing with pride between the dealing with lust and money. This arrangement is meaningful. Every fleshly person who is a lover of money is a proud person. Pride is always found between lust and the love of money.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> </body></html>
