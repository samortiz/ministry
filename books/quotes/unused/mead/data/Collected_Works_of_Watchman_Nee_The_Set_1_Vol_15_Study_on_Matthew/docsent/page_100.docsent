   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's Note: The following study concerning the rapture is similar to the four articles entitled "The Rapture and the Tribulation" published in Notes on Scriptural Messages, Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>43, 49-50, and The Christian Resumed , Issue No. 1, which appear in Volume 19 of the Collected Works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To understand Matthew 24 and 25, we need to understand the matter of the rapture first.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rapture is the most important matter before the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regrettably, many people misunderstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word rapture is equivalent to the word "receive" in John 14:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be raptured is not to climb up by oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be raptured is be received by the Lord up to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, rapture is a special term.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will come quickly, and when He comes, He will receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the matter of the rapture, there are many different opinions among the believers: 1 Some say that all the saved ones will be raptured before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 Some say that all the saved ones must pass through the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 Some say that part of the saved ones will be raptured before the tribulation and part will be caught up after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With these three schools, each regards the others as heretical and cuts off fellowship with the others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all these schools there are well-known persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first school are Darby, Kelly whose mind Spurgeon once said could encompass the universe , Torrey who later changed to the post-tribulation school , Moody who later changed to the second school , Brooks, James Gray, Gaebelein, Weiss, Scofield, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second school includes M ller who first believed in pre-tribulation rapture , A. J. Gordon of Boston , Simpson, Erdman, Moorehead, Henry Frost of Canada , Chamberlain a co-worker of Taylor , James Wright, Newton, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the third school are Hudson Taylor, Robert Chapman, Robert Govett Spurgeon extolled the light of his writing as surpassing the previous century's, and said that in his writing there is gold , Pember, Panton the "king of prophecy" , etc.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although none of the three schools can ignore the others, only one school is right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us have an impartial attitude in studying this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us be the prosecutor, and not the lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. REASONS FOR THE FIRST SCHOOL</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RAPTURE BEFORE THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The proponents say that in 1 Thessalonians 1:10 "the wrath which is coming" is the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the verse says "delivers," it must therefore mean that the rapture is before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also, they say that 1 Thessalonians 5:9 tells us that God has not appointed us to wrath, and that wrath equals the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To assume that the above evidence refers to the great tribulation is completely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why must wrath here be the wrath of the great tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we assume that the wrath here is a part of the great tribulation, there is still insufficient reason to believe that the wrath equals the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The great tribulation, on the one hand, is God's punishment and wrath upon the unbelievers; on the other hand, it is Satan's punishment and wrath upon the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan's attack on the believers causes them to come under great suffering, but this is not the believers suffering under God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. These say that in Jeremiah 30:6-7 "a time of distress for Jacob" indicates that the great tribulation is only for the Jews, not for the Gentiles or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the church is not Jewish, in the concept of these men, we will not pass through the great tribulation Dan 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the whole Bible had only the above two references, the great tribulation would indeed be for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we must look at other places in the Bible, for example, Revelation 3:10: "To try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the prophecies of Jeremiah and Daniel were spoken to the Jews, there are the terms "Jacob" and "thy people," etc.</S>
