   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The praise about the King should undoubtedly come first, but the praise concerning the queen should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the queen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is deeply gratified when we speak well of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our praises must be not only about Christ, but many times about the queen, about the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The queen is seen in gold of Ophir.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gold in typology signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church's beauty is not in anything but the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She is royal and she is divine; she is in gold of Ophir, the best gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the Psalmist immediately turns to the queen and says, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of praises here we have an instruction to the queen which is exceedingly meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes even the instructions given to the local churches are the same as praises in the ears of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are the instructions: Hearken and forget.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget, how to hear the Spirit's living, up-to-date speaking, and how to forget the past the old relationships, the old ways, the old background.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must forget our people and our father's house "so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we forget the past, the more beautiful we become in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever I hear some people speak of their past, I have the sense of ugliness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the King's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He is the Lord, He is worthy of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"He is thy Lord; and worship thou him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible allows us to worship only God; anything or anyone that is not God, we should not worship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But here we have proper worship, because it is worship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the King, He is a man, He is God, and He is the Lord He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Worship Him!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 12: "And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that if the local church is in a proper condition, the people of the earth will come to it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only the poor and the lowly will come, but the rich and the honorable, on the one hand with a gift, and on the other hand to entreat the church's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these are praises about the church, but praises to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now let us go on to verse 13: "The king's daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we have not the daughters, but the daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 9 we read that the queen was arrayed in gold, but here the clothing is of wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gold, as we have seen, signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wrought gold, however, signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is not only gold, but wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He, with His divine nature, has undergone so many sufferings and has been dealt with in so many ways that the gold in Him has become wrought gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now this wrought gold, this Christ, has become our clothing, our righteousness, that we may stand justified in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eyes of God, we are clothed with Christ as the acceptable righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is our righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then verse 14: "She the queen shall be brought unto the king."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not say that she will be brought unto God, but unto the King.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wrought gold is sufficient for us to abide in the presence of God, but an added factor is necessary that we may stand in the presence of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of broidered work."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This raiment of embroidered work is the pure and white linen mentioned as the righteousness of the saints in Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The clothing of wrought gold, as we have seen, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The raiment of embroidered work here is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the first is the objective Christ; the second is the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The objective Christ is our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God; the subjective Christ is Christ Himself woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The latter is not merely a garment that we put on, but one that is worked into us, stitch by stitch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ as the wrought gold is the righteousness put upon us that is our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But following that, the Holy Spirit is working day by day to embroider Christ into us stitch after stitch.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we will have another raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will have two robes: the first is for the Father's satisfaction; the second is for Christ's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is by the second that we will be brought unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All these are definitions and descriptions of the church, but praises unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe that nearly all of you have the wrought gold as your clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have joyful assurance that you have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But suppose that today you should be brought unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On one hand you have been justified, but on the other hand you are short of Christ being wrought into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a real shortage of the embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From the day you were justified until today, how many stitches have been embroidered into your being?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the brothers and sisters in the church life are indeed precious, and we praise the Lord for them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But in another sense everyone is a little needle.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we will have a raiment of embroidered work to satisfy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Revelation 19 we see that it is by this garment the bride is made ready for the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the garment of broidered work mentioned in Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verses 14 and 15: "The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The virgins also are the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing they are all praises to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They shall enter into the King's palace.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All the saints shall be brought into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now we come to the third section of the Psalm, the praise to the King about His children.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verse 16: "Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On one hand we are the daughters and the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then all the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Verse 17: "I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How could Christ be on earth with all the people praising Him for ever and ever?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is through the princes, through His children, through us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To satisfy Him we are the virgins, the kings' daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To rule for Him we are the princes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He will rule over all the earth through us as His princes and will be praised by all peoples through us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe that this Psalm, Psalm 45, is the richest Psalm concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No human mind could compose such a Psalm; it is far beyond human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In such a short Psalm of only seventeen verses, how many aspects, how many points, how many items there are!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What a good matter we have with which to bubble over!</S>
