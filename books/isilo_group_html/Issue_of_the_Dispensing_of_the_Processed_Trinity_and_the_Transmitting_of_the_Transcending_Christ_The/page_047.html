We always behaved, acted, and took action in the recovery as one Body. This is why the Lord's recovery could exist on this earth over these past approximately seventy years. We do not have any organization to keep anything, but the recovery is still here. The recovery is still existing and has been kept by the principle of the Body. While I was ministering the word, I often considered Brother Nee. I considered what he spoke; I did not like to speak anything which was contradicting with his ministry. If I had spoken in a contradicting way, where would the recovery be today? We must know the Body.</P><P>I would like to say again that the Body is the intrinsic significance of the church. If there were no Body, the church would have no meaning. The church makes no sense without the Body. But hallelujah, there is the Body! Without the Body, the church makes no sense, but with the Body, there is the intrinsic significance of the church.</P><P>The transcending Christ is far above all. He is above Hades, above the earth, above the air, and even above the third heaven. This One is transmitting Himself to the church, which is the Body of Him who fills all in all.</P><P>What is the difference between the church and the Body? We need to see that the church of God is the frame and the Body of Christ is the organism. We can use an apple tree as an illustration. The tree is the frame, and the apples are the very organic essence of this tree. If you have only the tree, that does not mean much. The tree is for the apples. We do not eat the tree; we eat the apples. Apples come out of the tree. The church is the frame, like the apple tree, and the Body of Christ is the very organic essence of the church, just like the apples are the very organic essence of the apple tree. These two are one. The church is the frame for existing. The Body of Christ is the very organic contents for people's satisfaction.</P><P>We have encountered much opposition due to one thing. We are here not just for the gospel to save souls. We are here to carry out God's eternal economy, with the purpose of gaining a Body for His Son, Christ, and this Body has to be consolidated into the local churches. In this country there have been a number of spiritual giants, but no one would care for the church. They care only for saving souls, but where are those millions of souls today? Where is God's economy? Where is the church for the Body? Where is the "apple tree" and where are the "apples" today? As far as God's economy is concerned, there is very little on this earth for the fulfilling of God's intention according to His heart's desire. But I have the full assurance that the recovery we are taking care of today, by His mercy and grace, is absolutely of the Lord. The strongest evidence of this is the Lord's speaking. Through many years the Lord's oracle on this earth has been and still is in the recovery.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
