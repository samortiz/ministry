<h2 class="head1">THE LORD NOT COMING TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS<br />BUT SINNERS</h2><p>First Timothy 1:15 says, &ldquo;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.&rdquo; Christ Jesus came into the world, which, as we have seen, is not a positive term. He came into the world, into the fallen human race, to save sinners. Paul, as Saul of Tarsus, was the top sinner. If Christ came only to save gentlemen, to save righteous men, Paul would have been finished. He could not have participated in God&rsquo;s salvation. In coming to save sinners, Christ took the sinners as His object. His heart is to save us, the sinners in the world.</p><p>First John 4:10 says, &ldquo;Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.&rdquo; We may never have been impressed with the intrinsic significance of verses like this. God is love; it is not that we loved God, but that He loved us. We never cared for God, and we forsook Him. <i>Us</i> in this verse refers to the world. God not only loved the world, but He also loved us. Moreover, His love is shown in that He sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.</p><p>Matthew 9:10-13 says, &ldquo;As He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners? Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill. But go and learn what this means, &lsquo;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&rsquo; for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo; The house mentioned here is not a corporate-living house; it is a house of sinners and tax collectors. Jesus, though He was the God-man, feasted there with them, reclining at the table. He enjoyed that time, and all the tax collectors and sinners, the ancient &ldquo;gangsters,&rdquo; joined together with Him. That offended the Pharisees. The Pharisees here may be compared to the ones who regulate the corporate living homes. The &ldquo;corporate-living Pharisees&rdquo; came and asked why Jesus was eating with the &ldquo;gangsters&rdquo; and &ldquo;bank robbers.&rdquo; The Lord answered that those who are strong have no need of a physician. If one is healthy enough to live properly in corporate living, he does not need a vital group as a &ldquo;health clinic.&rdquo; A strong, healthy man does not need to go to a clinic. Jesus, the Son of God, did not come for the strong men; they do not need Him. He came for the ill ones. The vital groups are set up not for those who are healthy and strong and able to live in corporate living, but for those who return to the brothers&rsquo; homes after midnight. God desires mercy, not sacrifice. If we sacrifice and offer much to Him without mercy, He does not like it. First Corinthians 13:3 says, &ldquo;If I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.&rdquo; To give everything for others without love means nothing. Mercy is the usher of love. To love those who are poor requires that we have mercy on them. The Lord did not come to call the righteous but the sinners. This is His heart.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING A SPIRIT<br />TO GO TO TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS</h2><p>Luke 7:34-50 also speaks of the Lord Jesus being with sinners and tax collectors. Verse 34 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&rdquo; If we see one who is a drunkard drinking beer, we certainly would stay away from him. We would rather go to one who is a saint living properly in corporate living. This kind of spirit now is spreading everywhere around the globe in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We love those in the proper corporate living, but we do not love the ones who go to the movies or drink beer. Instead, we may gossip about them. This is the spirit that fills all the churches. Some may charge me, saying, &ldquo;Did you not teach us concerning beer drinking?&rdquo; Yes, I have taught about this, but there is another side. Believe me, in the New Jerusalem no one will drink beer again. At that time, the beer drinkers will all be in the lake of fire. But today Christ is the heavenly ladder. He is not a flat stairway but a standing stairway. Previously, we were in &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; When I was under twenty, I played mah-jongg behind my mother&rsquo;s back; all the Chinese like to play mah-jongg, but one day a heavenly ladder appeared to me, and I climbed it. I left the mah-jongg table and climbed to the New Jerusalem.</p><p>I can never forget a certain pastor. While I was playing mah-jongg, he came to me every week. My older sister was studying in the highest women&rsquo;s seminary in China. She loved the Lord at that time, and she knew I was not gained by the Lord, so she committed me to this pastor. After that commitment, he came to me every week for about three or four months, but he did not speak much. Finally, at the end of December he said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, you are busy at the end of the year because in your business you have many things to do. Therefore, I will not come to you next week. I will wait until the New Year is over.&rdquo; He did not come, but remarkably, the heavenly ladder came. As all the Chinese know, the second day of the Chinese New Year is a day of rottenness, gambling, and all manner of entertainment. On that day, I rose and put on my best, new clothes. After breakfast, as I stood there in my new clothes, my mother asked me, &ldquo;What shall you do today?&rdquo; As I considered her question, I could not speak. Right away without thinking I said, &ldquo;I shall go to Pastor Yu&rsquo;s church.&rdquo; My mother was very happy. Then I went to that denominational church. That was my first time to climb the heavenly ladder. Christ went to a house full of sinners and tax collectors. The vital groups, the co-workers, and the elders should pick up this spirit, the spirit of God loving the world, the spirit of Christ coming to the worst homes in order to gain people and put them upon Him as the heavenly ladder that they may ascend on Him.</p>
