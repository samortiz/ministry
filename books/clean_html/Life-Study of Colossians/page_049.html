<h2 class="head1">THE HEART AND THE MIND</h2><p>In this verse Paul deals with two crucial organs of our inner being: the heart and the mind. (The word understanding implies the mind.) Once the heart has been hurt and has become cold and divided, it is easy for the mind to be distracted or even attacked by the enemy. When the mind is in such a condition, it cannot understand the word that is ministered concerning Christ and God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>Problems in the heart are often the cause of mental problems. If a person&rsquo;s mind is under attack by the enemy, this is an indication that his heart is wrong in some way. Whenever the heart is wrong, it is easy for the mind to be in darkness or subject to attack. This is an important principle. Most cases of mental illness have their source in problems that exist in the heart. More than forty years ago, the superintendent of a large mental hospital told me that, according to his experience and observation, mental problems are caused by problems related to greed for money and sex. These are problems of the heart. Greed for money causes problems in the hearts of some, whereas lust causes problems in the hearts of others. Such problems cause the mind to come under attack. Through years of experience, we have learned that mental illness can be traced to problems in the heart. The mind is attacked because the heart is wrong. Perhaps someone has a certain ambition or desire in his heart. If this ambition or desire is not fulfilled and is not dealt with, the mind may be attacked.</p><p>Paul no doubt realized this; he knew that it was crucial for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted and knit together in love. If their hearts were cared for in a proper way, the saints would have the riches of the full assurance of understanding. Their minds would once again function normally to understand spiritual things. When our hearts are comforted, our minds will function properly. But if there is a problem in our heart, there will be a problem in our mind also. The heart regulates the mind. Whether the mind is normal or abnormal depends on the condition of the heart.</p><p>The relationship with the saints in the church life tests what is in our hearts. If our hearts are possessed by certain ambitions, desires, and goals, our minds will not be normal and will cause us to have problems with others. For example, if my mind is under attack because of a problem in my heart, I may be very displeased if a brother does not greet me with a smile. I may be further troubled if this same brother invites another brother to lunch with him, but does not invite me. I may become quite angry over the situation. This anger is not caused by temper; it is caused by the problem in my heart. In my heart I may desire respect, honor, and position. This may cause me to feel that others should show respect for me by greeting me in a pleasant way. However, if I have no problem in my heart, I shall not be troubled if a brother does not smile at me or does not include me in a certain activity. If our heart is right, we shall be happy in the church life, no matter what happens to us. But if there is a problem in our heart, we shall be displeased with the church. This is a very serious matter.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL ASSURANCE OF UNDERSTANDING</h2><p>For the heart to be knit together with others in love involves the emotion, whereas to have the riches of the full assurance of the understanding involves the mind. If we do not have a proper heart, we shall not be able to receive the revelation concerning Christ. To see the vision of Christ we need a heart that is comforted, cherished, and knit together with others in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding. How happy I am that the hearts of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been comforted and knit together! Because our hearts have been knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, we can receive the revelation in the book of Colossians.</p><p>The riches of the full assurance of understanding equal the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ. When our hearts have been comforted and our minds function normally, we shall have the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God.</p><p>Now we can see why Paul struggled for the hearts of the Colossians to be comforted. He knew that this is the only way the saints can have the full assurance of understanding. Because our hearts have been cherished and knit together, we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have such an assurance. This assurance gives us the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God. May the Lord daily cherish our hearts that we may have a healthy church life! When our hearts are happy, it seems that all the brothers and sisters are wonderful. But when our hearts are not happy, the opposite seems to be the case. How important it is for our hearts to be cherished by the Lord!</p>
