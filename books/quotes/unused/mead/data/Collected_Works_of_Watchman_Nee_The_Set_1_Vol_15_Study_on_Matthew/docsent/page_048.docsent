   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The first month is the time of Christ's working, and the second month is the time of the Spirit's working.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this there is a gap, a period with no feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in the seventh month there are feasts again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the things of redemption begin with the Feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Closely following the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can keep the Passover without putting away the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Three days after the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of the Firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is offered in this feast?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A sheaf not a single stalk of the firstfruits is to be waved before God Lev 23:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in Jerusalem many believers came out of the tombs after the Lord's resurrection Matt 27:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the death of Christ, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised v. 52 because the Lord had overcome the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Lord's resurrection, they came out of the tombs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the "spoil" mentioned in Isaiah 53:12, indicating the glory of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Feast of Pentecost refers to the descending of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is what the two loaves of bread baked with leaven and offered as a wave offering typify.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One of the two loaves refers to the Jews and the other to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Feast of Pentecost has already begun, and we are enjoying the accomplishment of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Feast of Pentecost has not ended yet; it will go on until the Feast of Propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like the case of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the future God will make a new covenant with the children of Israel, but today we are already enjoying the blessing of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, on the one hand, is applied to the Jews, and on the other hand, is related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Feast of Propitiation is also in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, today we have a foretaste of it Heb 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Feast of Tabernacles refers to leaving the houses and rejoicing and points to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is still temporary, not eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the wheat, there are four steps mentioned in Leviticus 23.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, there are the firstfruits, referring to the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible many were resurrected, but the Lord was ordained to be the Firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Firstfruits" implies that others are not ripened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, firstfruits are reaped first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, in the Feast of Pentecost the loaves of bread as firstfruits refer to those who are raptured first, that is, before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, there is the general harvest; this is the rapture after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fourth, there is the gathering of the gleanings after the harvest; this refers to the rapture of the fragments.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew 13 records a comparison between wheat and tares, showing that their ends are different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 14 and Leviticus 23 record a comparison between different kinds of wheat, showing that their ends also are different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although all are wheat, they are harvested at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some say that all will be raptured together before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are merely trying to comfort themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, the Lord should have said, "Blessed are you because you are the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You do not have to watch or endure."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the requirement for rapture is not the maturity in life, then all the warnings are meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wheat needs to be dried; it is different from grapes, which need water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, it needs sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the time of harvest, the standard for harvest is the amount of water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the stalks and roots are all dried up, then they can be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are all wheat, so we must be dried up; that is, we must not love the pleasures of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Mr. Panton once said that wheat dries toward the earth as it ripens toward heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sunshine signifies the grace of tribulation, while the dew signifies the grace of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sunshine helps the wheat to grow and ripen; it causes the wheat to be dried and not to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, wheat is an annual plant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The earth is not our permanent dwelling place; it is our temporary place of sojourn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The wheat are ripened group after group.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One martyr said, "I can give my life for another to die."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wheat has no safeguard on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not have the thorns of roses, and it is not as strong or firm as the fig trees or as high as the vine trees.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is most tender and easily bent by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is wise in using wheat to represent the saints, the sons of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord will see whether or not we are ripened, and then He will reap.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The rapture of the believers is determined by the believers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before the Lord's coming, the first rapture will take place, in which very few saints the hundred and forty-four thousand mentioned in Revelation 14 will be taken before the throne, which is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These also are the loaves offered in the Holy Place at the Feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation 14:6-13 concerns the gospel and the warning during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verses 14-16 cover the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Son of Man being on the cloud is the situation described in 1 Thessalonians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Revelation 14:15, ripe in the original language means "cooked by roasting."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since the sunshine is ineffective, the Lord has to use fire persecution and tribulation which is more severe than sunshine to roast them until they are done, that is, ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, eventually the believers have to give up the world and become dried, either by the scorching of the sun or by the roasting of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One day you may love the world, but the world may not love you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The difference between the five foolish virgins and the five prudent virgins is merely a matter of those who are early and those who are late; in other words, which believers are ripened first?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Revelation 14:17-20 the sickle is related to the angels, and the "grapes" are the evil men not a type of the Israelites, whose type today is the fig tree .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These grapes are the slain mentioned in chapter nineteen who fall at the battle of Armageddon.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What follows that is the Feast of Tabernacles Deut 16:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The gathering of the gleanings takes place after the harvest; it signifies the rapture of the fragments.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who are raptured first are the firstfruits; the general harvest is the rapture after the great tribulation 1 Thes 4; 1 Cor 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the wheat will be harvested; it is just that some will be reaped first and others later.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The day of the Lord's coming is near.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the last days the believers need to endeavor in three great matters: 1 the eternal life, 2 the rapture, and 3 the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Concerning the first thing, we thank God that He has already done it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we might have eternal life through Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The other two things require our own preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Rapture is related to our living our watchfulness, endurance, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Reward is related to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But this distinction is not absolute, for both are mutually related.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For instance, Philip was raptured in type while he was working Acts 8:39 .</S>
