   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Seeing a Seed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to verse 10b, Christ made His soul an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sin is a common title that includes trespasses, iniquities, wrongdoings, and every wrong or evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's making His soul an offering for sin indicates that He was willing and volunteered to sacrifice Himself as an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By doing this, Christ entered into resurrection, in which He produced a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was His satisfaction, and this was also the Father's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seed produced by Christ in His resurrection is His believers for the building up of His Body as His continuation, with which He will extend His days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ extended His days by producing a seed the believers to build up the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is still extending.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Body of Christ is extending, the days of Christ also are extending.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the end of verse 10 we are told that Christ will prosper in the pleasure of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past two thousand years Christ has been very prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has been the most successful One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although He encountered all kinds of attacks, all kinds of opposition, and all kinds of troubles, no one has been able to defeat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, He has prospered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord has prospered in spreading His recovery to America, and now He is preparing to spread to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That too will be Christ's prospering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also the prolonging of His days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ still lives on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we are here, Christ is here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 52:13 we were told only that Christ will prosper, but we were not told in what He will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, in 53:10 we are told clearly that He will prosper in the pleasure of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The pleasure of Jehovah is to reveal Himself into us, to make us the seed of Christ, to make us a part of Christ, to make us the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is God's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seeing the Issue of the Travail of His Soul</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Being Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 53:11 says, "He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The issue of the travail of Christ's soul refers to the many who are justified made righteous by knowing Christ, for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 13:39 says, "And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the justified ones will also be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will all become Christ's seed; they will all become the members of His Body to build up the Body as His organism.</S>
