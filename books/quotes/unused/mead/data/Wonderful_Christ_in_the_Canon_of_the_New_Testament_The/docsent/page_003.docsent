   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we have another verse which speaks about the seed of Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed Gen 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the seed of Abraham, all the nations, not only Israel, shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BRANCH, THE FRUIT, AND THE ROOT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we must see that this seed, Jesus, eventually becomes the branch, and this branch is called the Lord our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have already seen this in Zechariah 6 and Jeremiah 23.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 4:2 then tells us that this branch is the branch of the Lord and also the fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus on the one hand is the branch of the Lord, and on the other hand He is the fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus is the branch that bears the fruit, and He is also the fruit that is brought forth by the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The branch is to bring forth the fruit, and the fruit is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also see that this branch is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious Isa 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse shows us that the branch is also the root, and this root is an ensign, a banner, or a standard for all the people of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And the Gentiles, including you and me, will seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And His resting place is full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is this One the root of Jesse, but also the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will be his father, and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:12-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the seed of David, but on the other hand He is the son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God said that He would be His Father, and He would be His son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will build a house for God, and God will establish the throne of His kingdom forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIVINE SEED AND HUMAN SOIL</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who is this wonderful person who has all of these names and who will accomplish the building of God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now we are clear that He is much more than we thought.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First of all, Jesus is a kind of seed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seed is God in the Son to be sown into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man is the fertile soil to this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this seed to grow, we need the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God in the Son as the embodiment of life is the seed, and we are the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are God s soil for God s growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not my thought or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew 13 shows us that Jesus came as the seed of God Himself and sowed this seed into the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, humanity is the soil for the divine seed to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Did you ever see this in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God in the Son is a divine seed, and we are the soil for Him to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is easy to gather the doctrines and stories in the Bible, but to enter into the depth of the Bible is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To know the teaching of the Bible is not difficult, but to realize the life that is conveyed in the Bible requires divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus is the divine seed that has been sown into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the soil in which Jesus can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seed is sown and something has sprung up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE BRANCHING OUT OF GOD TO BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the seed, we see that Jesus is also the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The verses we have read show us that He is the branch of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this we can realize that this man Jesus was the very branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God branches out in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus is the branch of God, and we are the branch of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus branches out God, and now we are branching out Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John 15 tells us that Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus is the branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To say that Jesus is the Savior and Redeemer is altogether right, but too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus is not merely our Savior and Redeemer, He is the branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And He has branched out to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have been caught by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day God branched Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually this branch bears the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jesus as a branch is not for a column or beam of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jesus is the branching out of God to bear fruit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And now we are the branches of Christ to branch out Christ for others enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jesus today is not only the seed, but also the branch, and this divine branch bears the fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that Jesus is the branching out of the Lord into us as the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Divinity branches out into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And through humanity, this branch bears fruit for man s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is this Jesus that builds God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible shows us that today God s temple is a group of living persons framed together and built up as God s habitation in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The only one that can build this temple is Jesus, and the way that He builds it is by being the seed, the branch, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, Jesus as the seed is the branching out of God to bear fruit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This seed will also bruise the head of the serpent, and in this seed shall all the nations be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is the branching out of this seed that will build God s temple, and it is this branch that bears the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both Zech 6:13 .</S>
