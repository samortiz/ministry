The opposition actually began in 1984 but was not manifested until 1987. From 1984, several people began to spread the rumor that Brother Lee&#8217;s ministry was off and that they would not follow any longer. It seems that those few brothers volunteered themselves to be the heroes in the Lord&#8217;s recovery with the intention to restore the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Hence, they began to contact others to join them in overthrowing Brother Lee&#8217;s ministry. They maintained the attitude that they were the heroes to oppose Brother Lee and restore the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Therefore, it was not an accidental rebellion or a temporary dissension; rather, there was a long period of fermentation and an overall plan.<p>In the beginning when I faced that situation, I remained quiet before the Lord, because I was very clear within. I have been walking on this way with Brother Nee, and in these scores of years Brother Nee had laid the foundation. From 1922 to 1952 the Lord&#8217;s recovery in mainland China was under the leadership of Brother Nee. Later, when the move of the Lord&#8217;s recovery was restricted on the mainland, I was brought overseas by the Lord. Spontaneously, the leadership came upon my shoulders. Everything that I did was absolutely in the same steps with Brother Nee, not only in the light of the truth but also in the aspect of life. I never departed from whatever Brother Nee did. Gradually, the Lord showed us something deeper and higher. In 1987 when that kind of situation was exposed, I did not say anything because within me I was very clear that no one could change the Lord&#8217;s recovery which is built upon truth as well as life.<p>I was very clear concerning what Brother Nee spoke; I also knew very well what I spoke. In 1951 I began to release a publication in Chinese entitled The Ministry of the Word. From that time until 1987 I released a great number of messages. At least three thousand messages were given in America and printed into books. When those people began to oppose me, I checked with myself concerning whether I had erred in the truth. Eventually, however, I could not find any mistake in my leadership of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The opposers alleged, first, that since 1984 I had changed and departed from the way led by Brother Nee, and second, that I exercised control. Concerning the second point, they strongly condemned me and said some very ugly things about me, such as Brother Lee being a king and a pope. When I heard all these things, I did not say anything. I realized that every step concerning the foundation laid by this recovery on the earth and the building in these sixty to seventy years was accurate; no one can touch or change anything.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S VINDICATION</h2><p>It has been seven years since the turmoil of 1987. I believe that in these seven years the Lord has clearly vindicated His recovery. This was evidenced in the recent conference in Hong Kong, which was altogether the Lord&#8217;s own doing. The highest attendance in the conference was over 880, including 263 who were from abroad. That conference in Hong Kong was altogether the Lord&#8217;s vindication; it was something carried out by the Lord Himself. Who could have nearly nine hundred people attending the meetings within such a period of time under such a difficult situation? This was the Lord&#8217;s vindication.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A General Outline of God's Economy and the Proper Living of a God-Man &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
