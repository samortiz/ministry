   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible tells us that after Peter recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was entirely God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter did not deserve any merit, but the Father's revelation enabled him to see the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter received a revelation from the Father, a revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a revelation is unknown to flesh and blood, even to Peter's own flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us go on with the same passage: "From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shall by no means happen to You!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the previous passage Peter saw the vision, while in this passage Peter became an instrument of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the previous verses Peter touched God the Father; here he touched Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first instance he was able to say, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the second instance he said, "God be merciful to You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shall by no means happen to You!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two statements are as far apart as the north pole is from the south pole.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not wrong in our understanding, we can safely say that no revelation in the four Gospels reached the height of Peter's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was the Father who had given Peter the revelation; he knew the Lord as "the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord proclaimed that the church was to be built upon this knowledge, this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter indeed received a great revelation, one unseen by other followers and friends of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps the revelation that Peter received and saw should be considered the ultimate revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the same chapter, he fell to the lowest depth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was speaking not only according to the flesh, but by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One minute he was speaking according to the Father; the next minute he turned around and was speaking according to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What an extreme turn this was!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the church is built upon such a minister, the gates of Hades surely will prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No, the church cannot be built upon such a wavering one; it needs to be built up by men of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ministers of the church must be as stable as stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They cannot be God's mouthpiece in one instance, and Satan's mouthpiece in another instance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not long after Peter received the highest revelation, he fell to the lowest abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was keeping the Lord from going to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not setting his mind on the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was utilized by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever Satan's word is released, the gates of Hades are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Satan prevails and the gates of Hades prevail, the church is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Had the Lord not turned Peter into a stable stone, the church would be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we need ministers as stable as stones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have to be firm and unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They cannot be one way one day and another way the next day, saying one thing one moment and another thing another moment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are solid and firm before the Lord, we will see what the church really is, and we will see blessing and victory over the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we are weak and wavering, Satan will open his mouth immediately, and the gates of Hades will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Peter we see an extreme contrast; there were great discrepancies in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a picture of the old, unchanged nature of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the last supper the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter said, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" 26:31, 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter's word was based on his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was saying the right thing; he was not lying, no, not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we must remember that we do not know anything about many of the things that we say to the Lord at the time of our consecration and revival.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter was a person who was rich in emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "I will never be stumbled."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this conviction was merely in his emotion; he was not this kind of person at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people who are rich in emotion have to learn to separate their emotion from their person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sooner or later they discover that their emotion does not represent them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people live by their mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are always in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they pray, and others say to them, "You are praying only with your mind; your heart is not in your prayer," they answer, "What do you mean my heart is not in my prayer?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A man can be in his mind so much that when his heart is not into what he is doing, he can be deceived to think that his mind actually is his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day when the light shines on him, he will see that his mind is not his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some people feel a burning within their heart; they think that they love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They proudly proclaim, "I love the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If another brother says, "You may think that you are loving the Lord, but actually you are not," they will argue, "If I do not love the Lord, who does?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When their emotion is dealt with by the Lord, they will realize that their heart and emotion are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their person is not the same as their emotion; there is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the same way there is a great difference between their mind and their person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Peter was speaking from his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He thought that he was the one who was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He boasted that even if all the others would be stumbled because of the Lord, he would never be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He did not realize that the "I" he was speaking of was not his person but his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not realize how much his outward man was at work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not realize how much he was living in his outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He did not know what he was saying, and he was not clear about himself at all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then the Lord said to him, "Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times" v. 34 . But Peter still did not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He told the Lord, "Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You" v. 35 . Here were another two extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Peter said that he would never be stumbled, but he denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He boasted that he would die with the Lord, but long before there was any call to die with the Lord, he failed and became fearful when the crowd pointed out that he had been with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These two extremes show us that Peter was a very unstable person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although his name indicated that he was a stone, his character was like water; it flowed one way one moment and another way the next moment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It constantly changed in shape, being rectangular one minute and circular the next minute.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was completely governed by his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He became a certain kind of person when he faced a certain kind of environment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the garden of Gethsemane, he dozed off with the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>During the heat of his boast, he claimed that he would never be stumbled, even if the others were stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But in the garden of Gethsemane, he fell sleep just like everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Here was a person who was so sure in his speaking and who felt the same way in himself, but who did everything just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He was living according to his feeling; he was not living according to his true self.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A man can live in his feeling so much that he no longer knows what his true self is.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He thinks that his feelings are himself.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He said he would never be stumbled, and according to his feeling, he sincerely believed that he would never be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But even before he met any opposition from men, he fell asleep in the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His spirit was willing, but his flesh was weak 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A while later, he gathered up his energy, drew up his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear v. 51 . He was bold to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He loved the Lord so much that he cast aside his personal considerations and stood at this height.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Yet in a little while he slid back again.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Mark 14 also provides us with a record of Peter's denial of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the beginning, "Peter followed Him at a distance until he was within the courtyard of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>And he was there sitting with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire" v. 54 . A servant girl of the high priest came and said to Peter, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus" v. 67 . Peter denied this and answered, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about" v. 68 . Here was a man who had followed the Lord for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Did he not know who the Lord was?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>One moment he could draw out his sword and cut someone, yet in the next moment he lost his boldness altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord was being tried, and everyone was mocking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Under these circumstances, Peter's boldness was nowhere to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>A little earlier, he was genuinely ready to die for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Now he was genuinely loving himself and shrinking from death.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He turned from one extreme to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The second time the slave girl spoke, Mark tells us that she did not address Peter, but instead she spoke to those standing by, saying, "This man is one of them!"</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>After the slave girl first spoke to Peter about being with Jesus the Nazarene, Peter denied it and went outside into the forecourt.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But the slave girl saw him again, and she told those who were standing by that he was one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then Peter made his second denial vv.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>69-70 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Matthew 26:72 says, "And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>After a little while, those standing by again said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean as well" Mark 14:70 .</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Peter began to curse and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak!" v. 71 . He began to curse and to swear! A little earlier he denied with an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Now he denied with cursing and swearing.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When the slave girl first talked to him, he denied the Lord and moved to the forecourt because he could no longer remain in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There he heard the slave girl telling those standing around that he was with Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He denied the Lord again with an oath that he did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>By the time those who were standing around echoed the words that he had been with Jesus, he did not just make an oath; he cursed and swore.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In the original Greek, three different words are used to describe his denial.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>One was used during his second denial, and the other two were used in his third denial.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>He exhausted every means of swearing and cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In his second denial he made an oath by God's name and by heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>In his third denial, he simply cursed and swore.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He not only invoked God's name to assure others that he did not know Jesus; he even cursed that he would be damned if he knew the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>His vocabulary was vulgar.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Peter had degraded and fallen to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Here was a man who was just the opposite of a "Peter," that is, one who should be solid as a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Instead, he was one way one minute and another way the next minute.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>One minute he was high in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The next minute he was Satan's instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>One minute he could boast that he would never be stumbled even if others were stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The next minute he fell asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>One minute he was bold to draw his sword to cut off the ear of Malchus.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The next minute he was even afraid of a slave girl.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>He denied the Lord with an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>He even cursed and swore in his denial.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Such a person surely had a serious flaw in his character.</S>
