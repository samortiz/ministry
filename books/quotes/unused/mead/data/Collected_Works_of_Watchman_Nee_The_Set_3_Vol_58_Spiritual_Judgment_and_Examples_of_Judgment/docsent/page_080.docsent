   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 59 Date:September 14, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER I. T.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family and studied in a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Others considered me to be a good and well-behaved student, but I was not clear about my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I thought that a man is saved by his works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later I found out that salvation is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was baptized on September 6, 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later I was married, and my second daughter died at the age of nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fortunately, the Lord's word comforted me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1936 I became gravely ill and almost died of an intestinal disease, but the Lord healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the Second World War the Lord preserved me so that I did not die from starvation, bombs, or sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am timid by nature and do not like to expose myself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am shy about talking to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come to the mountain to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After listening to all the truths, I realized how far I have been from the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, my poor health has precipitated self-pity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My heart is active, and I want to do many things, but I often find myself unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to know what is the relationship between treating the body according to the natural law and temperance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the end of your testimony, you spoke of your timidity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Timidity or fear is a symptom, not a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An underlying reason for fear is self-preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more a man tries to preserve himself, the more fearful he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The less a man is willing to suffer, the more he fears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our sister has to put herself in the Lord's hand decisively and unreservedly at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to be bolder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to stand up against self-love, self-pity, and self-preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not be afraid of being hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you will do this, your pathway will be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are physically strong can do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though you are weak and unable to do many things, you still are full of fear and self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is from your own confession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You cannot decide whether you should go along with the natural law of health or whether you should ignore yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man can maintain the natural laws of health without indulging in self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In contrast, a man can break natural laws and be still very much indulgent in self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keeping the natural law is one thing and being indulgent in self-love is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should only be concerned with whether or not we are indulgent in self-love while we are taking care of the natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should take care of our health before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It would be wrong, however, for this care to become a form of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is not the straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once a man indulges in self-love, he misses the opportunity to learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very easy for a man to indulge himself in self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man cannot be free from such love, he should seek to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It appears that those who do not abide by the natural laws tend to be more self-loving than those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is good that you can ask this question.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It shows that you are sensitive to this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to ask the Lord to save you from self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Naturally speaking, you are a gentle and tender person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your outer man is not hard, and your spirit is also sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Considering your background and personal condition, it is interesting that others are able to touch the tender side of your human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason you should express God all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you allow the Lord to inflict wounds, scars, and bruises in you, you will express God's life more and will become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you cherish your self-love and hesitate to deny your self, you will not have many scars, and others will only touch your natural meekness and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your spirit will not be released freely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the wounds are not deep enough, there will not be the outflow of a wounded spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If your outer man is broken, you will have the following results: Others will easily touch your spirit; your spirit will easily be released, and there will be less distance between you and others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If your old man is broken, your inner man will flow easily, and others will be able to approach you easily.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When your spirit does not flow easily, others cannot approach you easily.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason you feel far from others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is distance between men because there is little breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A man whom God uses is one who has no distance between him and others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul and Peter were such men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The obstacles between you and others must be removed before your spirit can flow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not love yourself, preserve yourself, care for yourself, or cherish yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to place yourself in the Lord's hand and allow Him to break you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should not have any reservation or any thought of self-preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you can do this, you will have no fear.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as you are delivered from these feelings of self, your fears will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You can see God's hand while you are in the training here in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems that God has started the breaking work already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to say to the Lord, "I have seen this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Make me one who can deny myself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I pray that Your breaking hand will work on me more each day."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have to see your own frailty, and you must not seek glory from men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, you should be satisfied with being despised.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You have to ask the Lord to remove all thoughts of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you have these spiritual dealings with yourself, you will have a bright, spiritual future, and you will be able to go on in the Lord's work.</S>
