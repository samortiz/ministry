   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CAPACITY TO BE GODLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are gloves in the likeness of the divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that we do not have the thumb, but the form of the thumb; not the fingers, but the likeness of the fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, our gentleness is a container for God s gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our gentleness is only the form, whereas God s gentleness is the substance, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we were created according to the likeness of God, we have the capacity to be godly, that is, to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Animals can never be godly, for they are not in the likeness of God and cannot contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in our love, kindness, and gentleness we can show forth godliness, God-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His creation of man, God made man as a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God enters into the vessels created by Him, He finds that the vessels are a proper match for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has emotion, and His container has emotion also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in the container God has a place to put, to dispense, His own emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way human emotion and divine emotion become one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The divine emotion is the content, and the human emotion is the container and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although this revelation is in the Bible, not many have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We praise the Lord that in His recovery this revelation has been made more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No more are we veiled to the fact that man is a vessel to contain God and that God feels at home in such a wonderful vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we see this, then we shall be able to understand the subject of this message: not an exchanged life, but a grafted life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>DISPENSATION, NOT EXCHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that when the divine life enters into the human life, the divine life becomes the content and the human life becomes the container and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there is no exchange, or trade, of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we do not exchange the human life for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of exchange, there is a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The empty glove is filled with the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Using another figure of speech, we may say that man is like a tire that needs to be filled with air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The air is dispensed into the tire and fills it, but the air is not exchanged for the tire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In like manner, the divine air, the heavenly pneuma, is dispensed into us, but it is not exchanged for our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, as we shall see, it is dispensed into us and mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some Christian teachers regard the Christian life as an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to this concept, our life is poor and Christ s life is superior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the Lord asks us to give up our life in exchange for His.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We yield our life to Him, and He replaces it with His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, our Christian life is not an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is altogether a matter of the divine life dispensed, infused, into our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a basic concept in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>VESSELS OF HONOR AND GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the book of Romans Paul uses three illustrations to show the dispensation of the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In each illustration we see that the Christian life is not an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first illustration is that of vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a certain content is placed in a vessel, an exchange does not take place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, there is a dispensation of the content into the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vessel may be earthy, not at all honorable or glorious, whereas the content is altogether honorable and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When such a content is dispensed into the earthy vessel, the vessel becomes a vessel of honor, a vessel of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not exchange; it is dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A UNION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul s second illustration is that of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Marriage is not an exchange of life, but a union of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In marriage, the husband becomes the very person of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, the wife takes her husband s name as her own.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In weddings throughout the world the bride s head is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that in the marriage union there can be just one head.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, marriage is a union of two persons under one head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In such a union there is no trade or exchange, but identification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wife is to identify herself fully with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this union, this identification, the wife is one with the husband, and the husband is one with the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a union of life, not an exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 7:4 Paul speaks of our being married to Christ: So that, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you might marry another, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is our Husband, and we are His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Between the Bridegroom and the Bride there is no exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, there is a wonderful union.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are one with Him in person, in name, in life, and in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a man and wife are to have a proper marriage, they must learn to be one in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, our Christian life is a life of identification with Christ and oneness with Him.</S>
