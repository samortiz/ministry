   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD AND THE CROSS BEING THE TERMINATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cross is the termination of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cross terminates man, and Christ expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as Christ and the cross are inseparable, the experiences of God's expression in man and the cross's termination of man are also inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ brings God to us whereas the cross terminates us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The purpose of God's salvation is not for us to improve our behavior, to be zealous, to be loving, or to have the highest morality; instead, the purpose of God's salvation is for us to be terminated through the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be terminated and brought to an end. We deserve only to be hanged on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we need the light to see that the cross is an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This experience is always to terminate man, to bring man to an end, to bring man to nought, and to bring man to zero.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word zero is not welcomed by people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Businessmen do not want their business to become a "zero"; students do not like to get a "zero" on their tests; and bank depositors do not like to have a "zero" balance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one likes the word zero.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's salvation, however, is to bring man to zero, to bring man to an end, and to terminate man through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who do not know God's salvation like to exhort people to reject evil, to turn to good, and to improve their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ultimate purpose of God's salvation, however, is to bring man to death, to bring man to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does one who is hanging on the cross, dying on the cross, still need to improve himself or reject evil and turn to good?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does he still need man's exhortation?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know that there is no such thing as exhorting a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can exhort only a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we know God's salvation to a higher extent, we will see where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will see that not only our sins and our behavior but also we ourselves were hanged on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now every one of us knows that we are those who are on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, here is the question.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we are on the cross, is our living also on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If it were so, it would take us only five minutes to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day God will open our eyes and grant us His view to see that we are already on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This light will nail us down so that, like a nail, we are unable to move.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we have seen this light, the light will follow us, accompany us, and keep a close watch on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that time on, we will reject even good, not to mention sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NEITHER DOING EVIL NOR DOING GOOD BY OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people may not understand what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times we commit sins by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition, we also perform good deeds by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do evil things by ourselves and we also do good things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, today God wants us not only to reject evil but also to reject good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wants us to reject our evilness as well as our goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not reject our goodness, then God's goodness and God's life will not be able to come out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A certain elderly brother was a very good man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day he said, "It is definitely good to live out God's love, but to live out man's love is better than to live out man's hatred."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said such a word because he did not see that only one kind of person can live out God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What kind of person is this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a person who rejects himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A person who rejects himself will reject not only his hatred but also his love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's love cannot be expressed in someone who lives in his hatred; likewise, God's love cannot be expressed in someone who lives in his own love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's love is as bright as pure gold whereas man's love cannot be compared even with yellowish clay.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible tells us that even our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment Isa 64:6 , not to mention our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In God's light we cannot but confess that even our love is not complete and that our inner motive is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our inward element is mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, God's love is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Like pure gold, God's love is pure, unblemished, boundless, immeasurable, and without motive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In short, if what is of man is not rejected or broken, then what is of God will not be expressed in man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not terminated, no matter what kind of help we ask of God, He will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God never helps us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we do something by ourselves, God will not move His hand or do anything to help us.</S>
