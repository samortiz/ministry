<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p>Only that which issues from the depth will touch others' depth. Only the outflow of the indwelling Spirit will touch others. The Holy Spirit must operate not only in the speaker, but also in the listener. Only when the Spirit works simul- taneously in the speaker and the listener will God's word bring light and life. If a church is not living in the Spirit, it is not qualified to receive any deep messages, because it cannot tell the difference. The only thing that will give light and life to men is revelation from God. It is easy to conduct a revival meeting with some churches. With other churches, one must have some specific utterance from the Lord before he can speak anything with impact. Otherwise, all he can do is amuse others' ears and minds.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DELIVERANCE OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Brother Hsu asked: How can a wrong person receive deliverance from God?</p><p>Answer: It is useless to say anything to some people, either briefly or in detail. After they listen to you, they remain the same. This is like preaching to an unsaved person. No matter how well you explain salvation to him, he is still not saved. In order for us to experience deliverance, we first have to understand our sickness. We have to know of our problems. If we are dead, of course, we will know nothing about our problems. But as long as we are alive, we have to know our problems. The knowledge of our own problems is the first step toward deliverance. No one ever gives his own keys to others as a gift, because no two locks are the same. Even if we give someone our keys, they will not fit their lock. In order for us to solve others' problem, the first thing we have to do is to know what their problem is. The problem with many people is basically a mental one; their minds have never received the light of the truth. The way of deliverance lies in the cross.</p><p>The cross that I am talking about is not a cross in teaching or doctrine, but a cross that operates in our life in a real way. The cross works and operates through light, that is, the truth. This cross is not merely a historical fact or a doctrine, but a reality that operates through light. When the cross comes, it is light, and when it shines into the darkness within you, there is no escape; you will see and will receive the truth. The truth sets you free and delivers you. This is the cross. It is useless for you to know the doctrine of the cross merely in the mind; it will not produce any effect in your life. If you see the cross in revelation and are put on this cross, you will cease to live because the cross means nothing less than death. If you hear a message and afterwards you are still alive, it means that the message was merely a doctrine to you. The real cross is something drastic, something that forces you to have some dealings.</p><p>The cross manifests its power through the light. It is not a "thing" that suddenly comes to you; it is a light that shines on you. When you can no longer bear your natural life, the cross is operating. I must repeat this a hundred or even a thousand times: It is light that kills. The searing light of the cross will destroy you. It is not enough for you merely to know this fact from the Bible. You must realize the inner working of the cross through the Holy Spirit. Sin is a very obvious thing, yet many people still do not know what sin is. It is not a matter of how much Bible teaching you have, but of how much truth you realize. It is a matter of how much you have been enlightened and how much reality you have experienced. May the Lord shine on us constantly with the light of the cross. May everything that issues from the natural life be terminated and all natural energy and wisdom be removed so that we can become proper persons.</p>
