   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JUST RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 3:16 should be read with 1:12 of the same book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:16 tells us that God gave His only begotten Son to man, and 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How do we obtain this life?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God gave and we receive; that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just receive and accept without doubt or fear what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The simpler we are, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mr. C.H. Spurgeon was a famous British evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once he was talking to some of his students about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One of them asked how he could know if prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He pulled out a gold watch from his pocket and put it on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he told the students that whoever wanted it might take it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the students began to be very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some could not quite believe that such a nice watch would be given away freely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others thought, "If I stretch out my hands to take it and he decides to pull it back, wouldn't it be embarrassing?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another said, "What if he suddenly changes his mind?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a while a little girl stepped up to Mr. Spurgeon and said, "I want it." Immediately he put the watch into her little hands and instructed her to take good care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When all the other students began to regret their hesitation, Mr. Spurgeon said, "When I said that I was going to give this away, I meant it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why didn't you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What God has given us is something far more precious than the watch; He has given us His Son to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God is so willing to give, why are we yet hesitant to receive?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply believe and receive, and you will obtain the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AS BREATHING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another person greatly used by the Lord was Mr. F.B. Meyer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At one time he did not realize how Christ can be life to us in the Holy Spirit, nor did he see how to receive this life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day he was praying on a mountain, hoping that he could obtain the Son of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of a sudden it occurred to him that all he needed to do was simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He took a deep breath and prayed, "Lord, in the same way that I am breathing in this air, I am exercising my faith to take You in."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he came down from the mountain, he testified to others, saying, "Since that day when I breathed in the Son of God, my life has been totally changed."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To receive the Son of God as life is a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is as simple as breathing the air into you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A friend of mine told me once, "Mr. Nee, I really want to receive the Son of God into my life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have prayed to God and told Him that I desire to have Christ in me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I was told that when Christ comes into me, I will have a burning sensation within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when I knelt down, my heart was cold as a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And after I prayed, nothing seemed to have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How do I know if I really have received the Son of God into me as life?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I said, "The Bible does not say that a man will feel burning or will remain cold when he receives the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All that it says is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is by faith, not by feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you depend on your feeling, you are not believing God's words; you are making God a liar!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God said He has given, then it is given.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It has nothing to do with your feeling."</S>
