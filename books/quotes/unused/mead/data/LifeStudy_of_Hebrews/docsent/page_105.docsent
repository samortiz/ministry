   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having Made Propitiation for Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His ministry on earth Christ also made propitiation for our sins 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sin, which has been taken away, caused many issues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of those issues became problems between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, at the time when Christ took away sin He also made propitiation for us with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense, He has appeased God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there were many problems between us and God, Christ s sin offering has appeased God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now there are no problems between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not pay attention to your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may still feel that there is a problem between you and God, but that is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not listen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tell the enemy, Sin has been taken away and God has been appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah, sin is gone and God is here!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having Made Purification for Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ has also made purification for our sins 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ offered Himself for our sins, made propitiation for our sins, and made purification for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If Christ had only offered Himself for sin and made propitiation for our sins without making purification for them, His work would not have been clean-cut.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But His work was the best cleaning work, for He has accomplished the purification of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of God, we are not only forgiven but also purified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we have a purified conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has also sanctified us through His offering with His blood 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He not only purified our sins but also sanctified us, separated us, set us apart, unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not care how you feel about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Christ s figuration, you have been separated, sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You do not belong to the city where you live; you belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have all been sanctified, separated unto God by Christ through His offering with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ died on the cross, offering Himself for us, He separated us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you hear this, you may say, It is not like that according to my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wait for a few years, the next age, or, at the latest, for eternity, and you will see that you have been sanctified unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Jerusalem we all shall be set apart unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I not only believe this for myself but for all the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not believe your present situation, for it is altogether a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes I am told by the brothers that a church in a particular place is not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not like to be told that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever I hear such a report, deep within me I say, You are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not believe this today, we shall believe it some day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day we shall see that every church is wonderful and that every church is separated, sanctified, unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But do not wait until eternity to believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Believe it today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you wait for eternity to believe this, you will miss a great deal of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you believe it today, you will enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What glad tidings it is to hear that we have been separated to God through the offering of Christ with His blood!</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ has perfected us through His offering 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Greek, the word translated perfected also means completed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ has already perfected and completed us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regardless of how weak, young, or new you are, you have been perfected and completed by Christ through His offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the gospel, the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>6.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this covenant all of the foregoing items are included.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ sealed this new covenant with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, it is a blood-sealed covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, He signed this covenant with blood, not with ink.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one can change it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Having Bequeathed to Us</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After Christ consummated the new covenant, He went to heaven, leaving the covenant for us 9:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After He left for heaven, the covenant immediately became a testament, a will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The word testament is an ancient term for the modern term will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ consummated a covenant and He bequeathed to us as a will, the will of our beloved One who died for us.</S>
