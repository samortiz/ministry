   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MINISTERING LIFE TO OTHERS OUTSIDE OF THE REALM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately after the creation of man, God placed man in front of two trees Gen 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first tree was the tree of life, and the second tree was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are to serve the Lord in a deeper way, we must know that both good and evil are versus life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our contact with people, we should not help them merely to distinguish between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, we should minister life to them to save them out of the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most tempting thing for the elders is the knowledge of good and evil, of who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When people come to the elders, the elders may be tempted to "measure" them to see whether or not they are up to a proper standard, that is, whether they are right or wrong, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When people come to us, we are accustomed to being full of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may feel that we know what it is to be right or wrong in the church and among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, what is in us in our contact with those who come to us is in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If this is our case, we have been tempted already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have left the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not measure others in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee told us that the best way to contact people is to sense their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, he also told us that our way of understanding this was still in the realm of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were still discerning people's spirit in the realm of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When people come to contact us, we should not remain in the realm, sphere, or kingdom of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should remain in our spirit, in the kingdom of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a person speaks, we must discern what he says, not in the realm of who is right or wrong, good or evil, but in the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we remain in the realm of good and evil, we cannot properly sense people's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a certain brother comes and speaks with us, we may discern that he is natural and not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This may be correct, but our feeling should indicate to us that we are still in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a great temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may even become offended with such a brother and not desire to speak further with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this happens, we will lose the opportunity to minister life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we remain in the realm of good and evil and become offended with the brother, we will be unhappy with each other and there will be no life in our contact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, our contact will cause us to have a negative impression of the brother, which we may one day express.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually we may say something negative about him to someone else, and this gossip will spread death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times such a thing transpires in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is because we are tempted by the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if we remain in the spirit rather than in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil, we will minister life to him in a pure and direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will be saved from the realm of good and evil, and we will help the brother also to be saved from this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of our contact will be very helpful.</S>
