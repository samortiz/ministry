   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dividing Up the Joint Assets</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Unbelievers as Soon as Possible</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If any brothers or sisters have entered into a joint investment of land with unbelievers or family members or jointly own shares with Gentiles, the joint assets should be divided up as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Otherwise, they will face difficulties when they try to serve the Lord or consecrate their assets to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Never hold on to joint assets or joint shares for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Making Suitable Arrangements Immediately</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>after Handing Something Over</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After one hands something over, he has to select a few experienced and respected brothers with spiritual wisdom and discernment to make suitable arrangements for him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want every penny that the brothers and sisters have handed over to be put to proper and good use.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A WORD TO HOUSEWIVES Doing the Best to Hand Everything Over</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>while Acting on the Ground of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Housewives must not offer up their husband's belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither should they offer up what belongs to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should not be criticized for acting unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to know that God is the master of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not need anyone to steal or rob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only offer up everything that we have a right to dispose of.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before we offer up anything, we have to ask, "Do I own this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Will I cause a problem in my family by offering this?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God does not want us to steal; neither does He want us to rob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless our husbands and children are being unreasonable, we should not violate their rights.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not many people in this world have consecrated themselves, and not many riches have been consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason every consecrated person is precious and treasured by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only is such a one precious; even his children are precious, and every hoof that he owns is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The money he consecrates to God is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Israelites left Egypt, God told them to not go empty-handed, but to take all their belongings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They did not leave one hoof behind Exo 10:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A believer should learn to preserve his wealth so that he can offer it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God treasures the children of the believers, and He treasures every hoof that belongs to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, we should not take anything that does not belong to us, even if it is but a thread or a shoelace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, as much as possible we should offer God everything that belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever we do, we have to stand firm on our ground.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Witness said that in the denominations, the number of men falls short of the money offered, but with us the money does not match the number of men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have the people, but not the money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not want there to be any unnecessary disputes in the family because of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not want the Lord's name to be shamed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should only consecrate by acting on the ground of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jewelry Should Be Sold as Quickly as Possible</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning the jewelry offered up by sisters, we have to pay special attention to the teaching in Peter's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that it is always wrong for Christian women to have any kind of adornments 1 Pet 3:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both male and female alike in the world consider gold more attractive than brass, and pearls and gems more precious than plastic goods in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past some of us collected jewelry ourselves, or it was given to us by husbands or relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we have to sell all the items that are under our disposal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We spent time and money to acquire these objects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we have to spend time and effort to dispose of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In particular, we should deal with our most cherished objects by disposing of them personally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not want another sister to buy them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Objects that have been consecrated to God should be sold to unbelievers, not to other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should be lenient and not criticize others, but we should be strict with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These things are dragging us down; they are sinking us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we place them on other sisters and burden them?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The money that we have offered up can be used to print gospel tracts or can be given away to needy saints or the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not know how to give it away, the church can prescribe certain instructions on a slip of paper and you can send the money accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is all right to ask others to forward money for you, but the church will not do this for you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This makes it clear where your money has gone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All jewelry should be disposed of as soon as possible.</S>
