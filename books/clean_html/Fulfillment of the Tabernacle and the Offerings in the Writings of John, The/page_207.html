<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 19:1-42</h1><p>Although chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, we may not see the reality in this chapter. This chapter is full of rich extracts. In this message and in the message following we shall consider twelve major points with a number of subpoints, all of which are related to the extracts of this deep and rich section of the Word.<p>Our concern in these messages is to present not the facts but the extracts. In giving this message I assume that you have at least a general knowledge of the content of this chapter. Let us, then, now consider the major points, the signs, in John 19.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF A THORN CROWN AND A PURPLE GARMENT</h2><p>The sign of a thorn crown and a purple garment signifies the rejected Messiah, or King, of the Jews. This sign is important because the entire chapter is on the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.<p>In this chapter first we see who the Lord is. He is the Messiah, the anointed One of God. This term denoted the King of God’s people. Hence, the One who was crucified was not a common man, a common figure. On the contrary, He was the One anointed of God, the One whom God had anointed to be the King of His people. Although God had anointed Him, the people rejected Him. They rejected their King, the very One whom they had been expecting for centuries. Even as they were rejecting Him, they were still expecting the coming of their Messiah.<p>John 19:1 and 2 say: “Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him. And the soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment.” This was done as a mockery. Both the thorn crown and the purple garment signify kingship. A crown, of course, is worn by a king, and the color purple signifies kingly honor. Even this mockery of the Lord Jesus was according to the sovereignty of God. The sign of the thorn crown and the purple garment signifies Christ’s kingship.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Verse 17 says, “And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.” In this verse we have the cross as a sign. Many Christians think that the cross is primarily a matter of suffering. According to their understanding, to bear the cross is to suffer. Some of us may still hold to this traditional thought. Concerning this, the well-known book, The Imitation of Christ, has exercised a great influence. Because this book matches the natural concept, I valued it very highly when I was young. I, too, regarded the cross as being a matter of suffering. When I spoke concerning the cross many years ago, I sometimes told the saints that if they were suffering in their circumstances, they were experiencing the cross. If a brother’s wife gave him a difficult time, in this situation he was bearing the cross. The point we are making here is that according to our natural concept, the cross is a matter of suffering.<p>However, according to the facts of history, it was not the purpose of the cross to cause suffering; instead, the cross was for terminating people. When someone was put on the cross, the purpose was to terminate him. This is clearly the meaning of the cross in John 19. Verse 15 indicates this: “They cried out then, Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” This verse indicates that for the Lord to be crucified, to be put on the cross, is for Him to be terminated. The cross, therefore, is not for suffering; it is for termination.<p>We need to realize that the special significance of the cross in this chapter is that the cross terminates the old creation. It terminates the things, the matters, and the people of the old creation, all of which are contrary to God’s purpose. Anything that is against the purpose of God needs to be terminated. In God’s economy this termination is accomplished by the death of the cross.
