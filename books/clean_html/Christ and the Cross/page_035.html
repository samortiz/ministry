<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating Sin</h2>
<p>Sin originated with Satan, who rebelled against God. When he enticed man to disobey God, Satan&rsquo;s sinful nature was injected into man, corrupting the man whom God had created to accomplish His eternal plan. When sin entered into man, it was mixed with man&rsquo;s human life and nature, and it became a power that causes man to commit sins. Out from this sinful nature, man commits sins and has a record of sins before God. Now the power of sin is in our being, and our record of sins is before God. We are in sin (Psa. 51:5), having a share in sin and in the sinful things related to sin. It is impossible for us to deal with either our sinful nature or our sins. Who can wash away his sinful deeds and remove his record of sins before God? Who can overcome the power of indwelling sin? No one can do this. However, the cross of Christ dealt with and terminated our nature of sin and removed our record of sins.</p>
<p>God put our sinful deeds, the various sins that we have committed, upon the crucified Christ so that He could bear them for us and redeem us. Christ&rsquo;s redemption satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, removing our record of sins before God. Furthermore, when Christ died on the cross, He was crucified as a man, in the &ldquo;likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3); thus, the sin that dwells in man (7:17), together with its power, was judged and condemned in the flesh on the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>Just as the cross of Christ redeemed us from our sinful deeds, it condemned and dealt with our sinful nature and its power. Without the cross of Christ our record of sins could not have been put away, and the sin in our being could not have been dealt with. Without the cross of Christ, our record of sin could not be removed, and the power of sin could not be terminated. Thank God that the cross of Christ has dealt with sin and everything related to sin! The cross removes our record of sins, and it deals with the power of sin. Because of the cross, there is no condemnation due to sins and no authority of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the World</h2>
<p>After Satan enticed and beguiled man, he used the world to control and usurp man. On the one hand, Satan injected sin into man; on the other hand, he surrounded man with the world. Satan used sin to corrupt the man whom God had created for His plan, and then he used the world to usurp the man whom God had prepared for Himself. Sin originated with Satan, and he organized the world. Satan uses sin and the world to operate on man from within and without, bringing man under his control to prevent man from being gained by God (1 John 5:19). Both sin and the world create enmity with God (Rom. 5:10, Col. 1:21; James 4:4).</p>
<p>If no one can overcome the sin that has been injected into man, who can escape from the world that surrounds man? Many desire to escape from the world to be gained by God, just as they desire to overcome sin to please God. However, just as we cannot overcome sin no matter how much we endeavor, we cannot escape from the world no matter how much we struggle. We cannot subdue sin or escape from the world. Therefore, just as God dealt with sin through the cross of Christ, He dealt with the world through the cross of Christ. When Christ was lifted up on the cross, not only was the ruler of this world, Satan, cast out, but also the world was judged (John 12:31-32). Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross judged and destroyed the ruler of this world, and it judged and destroyed the world that he rules.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ not only dealt with the sin that indwells us but also the world that surrounds us. It frees us not only from corrupting sin but also from the usurping world (Gal. 1:4). The cross separates us from the world. Hence, like Paul, we can declare that through the cross the world has been crucified to us and we to the world (6:14). Whoever receives the cross is freed from the usurpation of the world. The world has no authority over those who receive the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the Flesh<br />
with Its Passions and Its Lusts</h2>
<p>Because Satan injected sin into the human body, our body was transmuted into the flesh (Gen. 6:3), which is full of passions and lusts (Gal. 5:24; cf. Col. 3:5). The flesh with its passions and its lusts collaborates with indwelling sin to deprive us of our freedom and to make us do what we do not will to do (Rom. 7:14-15). It causes us to indulge in sinful things and makes us children of wrath before God (Eph. 2:3). Even if we struggled with all our might, we could not rid ourselves of our transmuted flesh, the body of this death (Rom. 7:24).</p>
<p>Just as our flesh collaborates with sin inwardly, it connects us with the world outwardly. As those who walk according to the age of this world, we also conduct ourselves in the lusts of our flesh (Eph. 2:2-3). Sin stirs up the flesh from within, and the world entices the flesh from without. The flesh is stirred up by sin and touched by the world. The flesh, sin, and the world become one and act as one to cause man to oppose God. Verses 7 and 8 of Romans 8 say, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flesh is not just connected with Satan; it is the place from which and the instrument by which Satan works. Satan is operating within us, causing us to walk &ldquo;according to the age of this world&rdquo; and to conduct ourselves &ldquo;in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts&rdquo; (Eph. 2:2-3). James speaks of the lusts of the flesh, the world, and Satan as being three great enemies to our living of a godly life (4:1, 4, 7). Satan entices our flesh through the world and stirs up our flesh to love the world, causing us to walk according to the age of this world, to befriend this world, and to be at enmity with God. Thus, the flesh, the world, and Satan act as one to cause man to be at enmity with God.</p>
<p>Because of the corruption of sin and the stirring up by Satan, the flesh is so strong that our whole being obeys it, lives by it, and becomes &ldquo;fleshly&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:3). Thus, we become flesh and are called &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; (Rom. 3:20). The flesh is weak in the things of God (8:3), and there is no profit from the flesh in our spiritual life (John 6:63). The nature of the flesh cannot change; the flesh is flesh (3:6); it cannot become anything else. God does not improve man&rsquo;s flesh, nor does He have a desire to improve it. God wants to terminate the flesh by the cross of Christ. It is His will that our flesh with its passions and its lusts would be crucified on the cross of Christ. According to God&rsquo;s determination and His way of salvation, the flesh does not need to be improved; it only needs to be crucified, and it has been crucified (Gal. 5:24). The cross of Christ has terminated the flesh and everything of the flesh. When the cross of Christ is received, the flesh and everything of the flesh are put to death.</p>
