Nearly all of the things revealed about God's eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians
The book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the Body, and the book to the Colossians is the revelation of the Head
When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!
God has something to dispense, so He needs an arrangement and an administration in order to carry out this dispensing
In a similar way, God Himself is a corporation with an economy, and in this economy God's divine business is the church
Their thought is that the church is a group of fallen people who are saved and who come together to worship God
In God's dispensation, in God's administration, in God's arrangement, in God's governmental stewardship, He has eternally planned the church
Even with the power and the capital it will become bankrupt without the wisdom or the proper way to run the corporation
The church will be filled with the fullness of God because it is the Body of Christ in whom the very fullness of the Godhead dwells
In chapter one of Ephesians there is the power that raised Christ from the dead, lifted Him up to the heavens, and put Him on the throne
In Colossians 1:29, the apostle Paul tells us that the power for him to minister is the inner energizing power
Esau had the life of the son, but he did not have the sonship for the sonship includes both the birth and the birthright
The children are the ones who have only the birth, but the heirs have not only the birth but also the birthright
When we were born of our fathers, we received life from our fathers, but by the birthright everything our fathers have is ours
Many Christians know that there is the word inheritance in the New Testament, but they do not know what this inheritance is
God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into us that He may be thoroughly mingled with us and expressed through us
His desire is to spread from our spirit to transform all the parts of the soul and eventually to transfigure our physical body
To be holy means more than to be separated unto God; it means to be overlaid with God and thoroughly mingled with the very nature of God
To be mingled with God means to be in God, just as the wooden boards in the tabernacle were overlaid with gold and were in the gold
The glorification is the full maturity that results in the manifestation of the sons of God, as seen in Romans 8
The complete meaning of God's sanctification is to regenerate our spirits, then transform our souls, and then transfigure our bodies
We have the birth of God within us, but our souls have not been transformed and our bodies have not been transfigured
We have the birth, and before us is the goal of the full sonship, the goal of glorification, which is the manifestation of the sons of God
After receiving the birth of God's life and the growth of this life, the Lord will grant us the enjoyment of the birthright
If we forget about ourselves, deny the soul, and live in the spirit, then the Lord will have the opportunity to transform us
God is not sorry that there is such an evil one as Satan, because without such a one, God's manifold wisdom could not be manifested
If you have a car which needs wisdom to handle, your wisdom will be brought to light, and all of your passengers will marvel
The whole universe has been damaged by Satan, but God needs such a one in order that His wisdom might be shown
God wants to bring to light to all His creation the economy of His mystery which before the creation of the world was known only by Himself
The image is related to the sonship, to the expression of God; the dominion is related to dealing with God's enemy
The sonship is the fulfillment of God's image, for it is by the sonship that we will eventually be in the full image of God to express Him
God not only created man in His image to express Himself, He also committed His full authority to man for the purpose of subduing His enemy
The church is built up by the sonship, and through the building up of the church, the enemy is subdued and God's wisdom is displayed
There are many positive insertions about the sonship, but there are also many negative insertions connected with the subduing of the enemy
The serpent entered the scene in Genesis 3, and it is not until Revelation 20 that the old serpent will be bound and cast away
It is God's eternal purpose that in the economy of the fullness of the times He might head up all things in Christ
All of creation was subjected to the slavery of corruption, so the whole creation is in vanity, waiting for deliverance
At the manifestation of the sons of God, creation will be delivered from the slavery of corruption in vanity into the freedom of glory
Glory in verse 21 is not an adjective but a noun, so the best translation is 'the freedom of the glory,' not 'the glorious freedom'
We have mentioned that, when our bodies are transfigured, we will be glorified, and this glorification is the manifestation
We must realize that the church is the only means used by God to fulfill His purpose and to settle all His problems
The church is the very vessel used by God to fulfill His purpose, which is to manifest Himself through man by mingling Himself with man
He has an enemy to deal with, and He has death, darkness, confusion, corruption, bondage, and vanity in His creation
God must liberate His creation from bondage and bring it into the order of liberty by heading up all things under the headship of Christ
When we are in the life and under the light, then we are delivered out of confusion and brought into order, harmony, and unity
God's way of recovery is Christ versus Satan, life versus death, light versus darkness, and order versus confusion
When we receive God into us as life, He comes into us as the very light, and under this light we are controlled in unity
There is something living within us, shining all the time, and under this light we are fully controlled in a joyful way
Spontaneously there is oneness in us, and this oneness comes from light, and the light comes from life, and this life is God Himself
By the Triune God as life, the light shines, and under this light all things will be brought into order under the headship of Christ
The church must be built up by experiencing Christ as life, and in this life there will be the light under which everyone will be controlled
Suppose by the mercy of God our eyes have been opened to see that God's economy is to work Himself into us as life
There will be no arguments or divisions or fightings or jealousies but complete oneness under the control of this light of life
We know that one day the New Jerusalem will be completed with God shining through this city upon all the rest of creation
God shines in Christ through the city, for the whole city will be transparent, everyone in it being transformed
There is no more clay, nothing opaque; every bit of clay has been transformed into crystal-clear precious stones
The old serpent will be cast into the lake of fire, and even death, the last enemy to be dealt with by God, will be cast away
The shining of the New Jerusalem is the glory of the manifestation of the sons of God, and all the nations will be brought into that light
It is by being life to the church, and the church being built up by this life, that the light of God shines out as the controlling factor
All of God's problems will be solved, and all creation will be brought into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God
