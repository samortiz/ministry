   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD Scripture Reading: Exo 10:8-11, 21-26; 12:6-11, 37-42; 2 Cor 6:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many commandments in the Bible concerning separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament contains many examples and teachings concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, Egypt, Ur of the Chaldees, Babylon, and Sodom are all types of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They show different aspects of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Egypt represents the joy of the world, Ur of the Chaldees represents the religions of the world, the tower of Babel represents the confusion of the world, and Sodom represents the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A man should come out of Egypt and also out of Ur of the Chaldees, just as Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lot went to Sodom, and the people of Israel fell into captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All should come out from these places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible uses four different places to represent the world and shows how God's people come out from these different aspects of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE TYPE OF ISRAEL'S EXODUS FROM EGYPT A. The Result of Redemption Being to Go Out</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God saved the Israelites through the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the messenger of God went forth to kill the firstborn in the land of Egypt, the angel of death passed over the doors which had the blood upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there was no blood on the door, the firstborn of that house was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It had nothing to do with whether the door was good or bad, whether there was anything special about the lintel or the side posts, whether there was anything good about that family, or whether the firstborn child honored his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The issue was whether there was any blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not you will perish does not depend on your family's status or your behavior; it depends on whether you have the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The basic factor for salvation is the blood; this has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We who are saved by grace are redeemed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But please remember that immediately after being redeemed by the blood, we must move and go out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that we can buy a house and dwell in Egypt after we are redeemed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are redeemed by the blood must set out that very night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lamb was slaughtered before midnight, and the blood was sprinkled with hyssop.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They ate their meal quickly, with their loins girded and their staff in their hands, because they had to leave immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first result of redemption is separation, that is, departure, a going out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God never redeems a person and leaves him in the old position to continue living in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is absolutely no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once a person is born again, saved, he must take up his staff and set out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the angel of destruction has done his work of separating the saved from the perishing, the saved ones must leave.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once you have been separated by the smiting angel, you have to pack up and move out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A staff is for walking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one holds a staff to lie down in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The staff is not a pillow; it is for walking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All those who are redeemed, old or young, must take their staff and leave the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as you are redeemed by the blood, you become a sojourner and a pilgrim on the earth; you have to go out of Egypt and be separated from the world immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must not continue to live there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was a sister who taught a class in a children's meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once she was telling the story of Lazarus and the rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She asked the children, "Do you want to be Lazarus or the rich man?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rich man enjoys himself in this age and suffers in the next.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lazarus suffers today and enjoys himself later.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Which would you choose to be?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An eight-year-old girl stood up and said, "While I am alive, I want to be the rich man, but when I die, I want to be Lazarus."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they need salvation, they trust in the blood of the Lamb; but after they are saved by the blood, they settle down firmly in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They think that they can have the best of both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember that the blood's redemption saves you from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once you are redeemed by the blood, you immediately become a sojourner, a pilgrim in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that you no longer live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It means that you are immediately separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever redemption is applied, this is the result.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as a man is redeemed, his course is changed, and he has to leave the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The separation of the blood separates the living from the dead; it also separates the children of God from the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we are redeemed, we can no longer remain in the world.</S>
