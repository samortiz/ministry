   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SHEPHERDING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in the church life there is the need not only for elders, but also for prophets, teachers, and exhorters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our problem today is that the eldership occupies too great a place in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers who love the Lord and have the ability to do something for the church have the subconscious desire to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing has bothered me more through the years than to see in so many brothers this hidden expectation to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yes, in 1 Timothy 3:1 Paul does say that he who desires to be an elder, an overseer, desires a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the motive must be pure, wholly for the Lord's interest and without personal ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, some of the brothers who want to be elders are motivated by ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, I have the burden to point out that there is much more to the church life than eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the "hotel" of the church life in the Lord's recovery there is not only the "room" of eldership but also that of prophesying, teaching, and exhorting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, many brothers endeavor to get into the room called "eldership," and many sisters want to enter the room called "leading sisters."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we have no such thing as leading sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not even like to hear this term used.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to forget about position and title.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Testament reveals that besides eldership there are many other functions the saints can fulfill according to their burden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A TESTIMONY AND AN EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I thank the Lord for the testimony and example of brother Eugene Gruhler, Sr. Although he was neither an elder nor a leader among us, he did a great deal of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He functioned in this way until the very hour the Lord took him to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the years he was with us, he invited a great many brothers and sisters into his home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone who spent time with him was strengthened and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what the church needs today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Brother Gruhler never sat in the front row, he was always watchful for new ones and invited them to his home for a meal at the first opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church needs such shepherds today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Shanghai the more experienced sisters were exercised to take care of others during the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Realizing that many needed to be warmed and comforted, they purposely sat next to new ones or weak ones in order to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you sit next to a weaker one in the meeting, that one will be greatly helped.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church life we need "mothers" and "fathers" to take care of the spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church needs shepherding; it does not need brothers and sisters to come together in special groups according to their preference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not normal for "mothers" to abandon their spiritual children and spend all their time together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is not the proper family life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the "mothers" may come together at certain times, they should spend more time in caring for the new ones, the young ones, and the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need a practical spirituality, not a spirituality in word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have such a practical spirituality, we shall care for those who are not coming to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Certain ones among us claim that they have seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Time will prove whether or not they have actually seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we should not make such a claim nor have any confidence in such claims.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may say that you have seen the Body, but you may not have anything practical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have truly seen the Body, you will be concerned for the weaker ones.</S>
