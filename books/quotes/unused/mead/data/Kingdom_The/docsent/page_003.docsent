   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to change our point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why must we repent for the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because, regardless of the concepts we cling to, we are not for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may be for education or for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be for Christianity or for so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be for gospel preaching or for the mission field.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may be for doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may be zealous for the spiritual gifts, or you may be seeking the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not know what you are for, but I am afraid you may not be for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must repent.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Repent from where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Repent from what you are doing and what you are thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Repent from all your concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not care and God does not care whether your concept is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as you are not for the kingdom, it makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must repent for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the New Testament age comes, the kingdom comes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are not in the kingdom, if you are not living for the kingdom, you need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PREACHING OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John the Baptist began the New Testament preaching by saying, "Repent for the kingdom" Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Lord Jesus came and repeated the preaching of John the Baptist Matt 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a shame that preachers today do not like to repeat the preaching of others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If one man should preach, "Repent for the kingdom," another will preach something new.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They do not like to follow others' preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus, however, became a follower.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He followed John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus was not the first one who preached repentance for the kingdom; He was the second.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is marvelous that the Lord Jesus repeated and continued the preaching of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Surely this shows the importance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the preaching of the kingdom were not so important, then the Lord Jesus would not have repeated it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He repeated the preaching of John the Baptist, we have a strong proof that the preaching of the kingdom was very important.</S>
