   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT CHRIST HIS PERSON 38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider what Christ is in His person in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>U. IN THE CHURCH 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Rock as the Foundation</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church Christ is the rock as the foundation on which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 , the Lord said, "On this rock I will build My church" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Roman Catholicism claims that "the rock" here refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although it is correct to say that the rock denotes Christ, not even this understanding is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The rock here refers not only to Christ but also to the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, this rock refers to Christ Himself as the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, this rock refers to the revelation of Christ which Peter received from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This heavenly revelation is the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we see this revelation concerning Christ, it becomes the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the church is built both upon Christ and the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church that is built upon the rock of Christ and the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the problem is that Christians form groups or so-called churches according to their concept and viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But their concept is not the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church must be built upon the rock, that is, upon Christ and the revelation of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see this, we shall be saved from division.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only one thing is built upon Christ as the rock, and this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any group that is built upon doctrines, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon Christ and the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the rock upon which the church is built, Christ is the unique foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ" 1 Cor 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one should lay any other foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know from 1 Corinthians 3:11 that Christ is the unique foundation for the church as God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, certain of the believers at Corinth were taking Paul, Apollos, or Cephas as their foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asks them, "Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By asking these questions Paul was pointing out that he was not the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, Paul says in 3:10, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The unique foundation is not Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or any one or anything other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem among the Corinthians was that they were trying to lay many other foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see in chapter fourteen that, for some, speaking in tongues was a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that it is possible for a particular practice to become a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Paul wanted the believers at Corinth to realize that he had already laid the unique foundation, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is common for Christians today to lay foundations other than Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, when someone declares that he is for immersion, he is laying immersion as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true of someone who is for tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever you claim to be for a particular person, doctrine, or practice, you are laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To lay a foundation other than Christ ruins the Body life and damages God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of laying another foundation, we must build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 9, Christ is our common portion, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Christ, God's unique center and our unique portion, is the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that we must build upon the unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should understand this not only doctrinally but also practically and experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we touch the depth of the truth in 1 Corinthians 3:11 and understand this verse according to its context and background, we shall see a vision of Christ as the unique foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This vision, this truth, will then govern and control us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint" Prov 29:18, ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Among the vast majority of Christians today, there is no governing, restraining vision of Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, many refer to Paul's word concerning Christ as the foundation; on the other hand, even while speaking of this verse, they are laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From this we see that we need to understand 1 Corinthians 3:11 not merely in a doctrinal way but in a way that is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should never say that we are of a certain person or a certain thing or that we prefer a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To speak in this way is to lay another foundation in addition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of laying another foundation, we should build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church's foundation is Christ, revealed and ministered through the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ephesians 2:20 speaks of the foundation of the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This foundation is the Christ whom they ministered to others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Christ who is the foundation of the church is the unique Christ revealed and ministered by the early apostles, as recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must stay with this Christ.</S>
