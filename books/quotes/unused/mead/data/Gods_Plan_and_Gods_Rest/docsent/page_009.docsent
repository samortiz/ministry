   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The last part of verse 9 says, "So that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The birth of the Lord Jesus, the human living of the Lord Jesus, as well as the redemption of the Lord Jesus show us that His redemptive work is not only for man, but for all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All creation except the angels is included.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning God assigned man to rule and overthrow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus is that man, and that man is now enthroned!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a man has overthrown the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the man whom God is after and desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His other aspect, He is a man related to us; He is our Savior, the One who has dealt with the problem of sin in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We sinned and fell, and God made Him to be the propitiation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, He not only became the propitiation for us, but He was also judged for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is proved by the splitting of the veil in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrews 10 tells us that the veil in the holy place signified the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Upon the veil were embroidered cherubim, which represent created things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of the Lord's death, the veil was split in two from the top to the bottom; as a result, the cherubim embroidered upon it were simultaneously rent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This reveals that the death of the Lord Jesus included judgment for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He not only tasted death for every man, but also for "everything."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 10 continues, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All things are for Him and through Him; all things are to Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be for Him means to be to Him; to be through Him means to be by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise God, He has not changed His purpose in creation!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What God ordained at creation He continued to ordain after man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In redemption His purpose remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not change His purpose because of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise God, He is bringing many sons into glory!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is glorifying many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God purposed to gain a group of new men who have the likeness and the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the Lord Jesus is the representative man, the rest will be like whatever He is, and they will enter with Him into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How is this to be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who is He that sanctifies?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who are those that are being sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are the ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can read the verse in this way: "For both Jesus who sanctifies and we who are sanctified are all of One."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus and we are all begotten of the same Father; we have all originated from the same source and have the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have the same indwelling Spirit and the same God, who is our Lord and our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "He" refers to our Lord Jesus, and "them" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"He is not ashamed to call them brothers" because He is of the Father and we also are of the Father.</S>
