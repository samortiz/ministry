   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 27-28:When the slaves were wondering about the appearing of the tares, the master said that it was done by an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To collect in Greek means "to root out by violent force."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rooting out is done not by a peaceful means but by a violent means; it is to cut off Prov 2:21-22; Deut 29:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The specialty of the Roman Catholic Church has been to put to death those who believed in heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same has been true with the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Episcopalian Church also practiced burning people to death by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the "collecting" of tares.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unfortunately, however, some who did not believe in heresies were also killed; even the wheat, the good believers, were put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A good number who were "collected" were wheat rather than tares.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Collecting" is not allowed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 30:"Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this, some think that it is expected that tares be present in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the word here concerns the field, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 5 says that the church should remove the evil man from her midst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is formed by the Lord, so she should not have the mixed multitude in her midst.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the sphere of the appearance of the kingdom, a mixed multitude is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Until the harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is where the whole matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>" The time of the harvest" is "the consummation of the age" v. 39 . On the one hand, the age refers to the present age of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, it probably began from the time of Daniel, because God gave the authority to the Gentiles then, and that began a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the strictest interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Daniel said that God is "the God of the heavens" Dan 2:18-19, 37, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God appeared to Abraham, He was "the God of heaven and earth."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the way until David, He was called "the God of heaven and earth."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ezekiel 8 through 11 show that God gradually withdrew Himself, and eventually He withdrew to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason God withdrew to the heavens was that the children of Israel were worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Satan became the god of this age, and God committed the earth to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although at the time of Nehemiah there were people who were returning to their country, God was still called "the God of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why Paul said in Galatians 1:4 that this age is an evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The consummation of this age ends with the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the conclusion of this age two things will be manifested: the wheat and the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The " harvest" refers to the consummation of the age, and the "reapers" are the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 30 there is the binding into bundles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Men have now bound themselves into associations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In an effort to become more intimate, they have bound themselves into " bundles."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This bundling has already begun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By studying church history in detail, we can see that within the past one hundred years since 1828, the truths of the Bible have been selected out one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who believe, believe; those who do not believe, do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who preach the personal gospel, preach the personal gospel; those who preach the social gospel, preach the social gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who preach premillennialism, preach premillennialism; those who preach postmillennialism, preach postmillennialism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yes is yes, and no is no. Twenty years ago the mixing in the church was very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not until 1915 that fundamentalism came into existence, and a division took place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the tares are being bound into bundles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A sign of Christ's second coming is this "binding into bundles," that is, the so-called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Men such as Fosdick have been exposed as modernists by the missionaries of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The binding into bundles is for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 14:1-5 is on the firstfruits; verses 6-13 are on the great tribulation that is, the warning of the three angels ; verses 14-16 are on the reaping of the wheat; and verses 17-20 are on the gathering of the grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When will the warning of the three angels occur?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will take place at the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the rapture of the firstfruits in 14:1-5 will take place before the great tribulation, while the harvest of the wheat and the gathering of the grapes will take place after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the harvest?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible it refers to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How do we know that the harvest of the wheat refers to the rapture?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the wheat is gathered into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The houses of the Jews were in one place and their fields were in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The barn is built near the house, and the wheat is stored in the barn, which is far away from the field but close to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the barn is the air.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the field is the world and the house is where God the Father dwells, the ripened wheat cannot be stored in either of the two places.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the barn must be the air.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is according to the significance of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the types in Leviticus 23 we can have a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Leviticus 23 records the following feasts: 1 the Sabbath, 2 the Feast of the Passover, 3 the Feast of Unleavened Bread, 4 the Feast of the Firstfruits, 5 the Feast of Pentecost, 6 the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, 7 the Feast of Propitiation, and 8 the Feast of Tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only was the Sabbath placed as the first, but also within every feast there was a Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This does not signify God's rest after creation; it signifies the completion of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God rests, and man also rests.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that both God and man approve of what the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are three feasts in the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, the Feast of the Passover is on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening Lev 23:5 .</S>

   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is one feast in the second month the Feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It takes place on the fiftieth day, counting from the day after the Sabbath, that is, the day that the firstfruits are brought in, through the completion of seven Sabbaths to the day after the seventh Sabbath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There are three feasts in the seventh month.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First, the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets is on the first day of the month vv.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>24-25 .</S>

   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>26-32 .</S>
