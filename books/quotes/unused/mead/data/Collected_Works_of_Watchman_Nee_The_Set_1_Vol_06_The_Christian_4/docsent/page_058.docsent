   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Actually, the two ways are merely two aspects, or two phases, of one way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cross and the Holy Spirit are the unique way to overcome the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Other than this way, any human resolutions, determinations, or vows to charity are destined for failure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank God that though we are helpless, He has the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has prepared a way for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, all those who belong to Christ Jesus and are regenerated have their flesh crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He died on the cross, our flesh was crucified there as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both the substitutional death and the identifying death have been accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both are fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Formerly, we believed in His substitutional death and were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that the flesh is always the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why God gave us a new life and a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what shall we do with the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since God considered it hopeless and impossible, He decided to terminate it, that is, to put it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no better way than to cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This puts the flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what the Lord Jesus has accomplished; He has accomplished it already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By crucifying our flesh with Him, it becomes possible now for us to put to death the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This has been accomplished without any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can this co-crucifixion become our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have said that the way is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sin here refers to the sinful nature which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By ourselves, we cannot cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only way is by reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Reckoning is an exercise of our will and our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that in our daily life, we should adopt the attitude that we are dead to the flesh, that we believe in God's word, and that we consider all God's words to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God says that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord Jesus; I believe that my flesh is indeed crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, we believe that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, we adopt the attitude that we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do this, we will have the genuine experience of dying to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we reckon this way, we will see the cross freeing us, and the flesh will become powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that once we reckon ourselves dead, we will experience instant victory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, many people experience a gradual deliverance from the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is either due to their own foolishness or to the lingering of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we persist in faith and if we take the proper attitude in our will, we will eventually overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, this does not mean that henceforth there is no more sinful nature in us and that only the new nature remains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we say this, we fall into heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only does this obscure the teaching of the Bible, but it betrays the experience of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Until we are delivered from this body of sin, we will never be free from the "flesh" the sinful nature which comes from the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though we have accepted the work of the cross, the fact that the flesh still exists means that we must continually "walk by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only by doing this, will we "by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cross is the instrument by which we crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Holy Spirit is the power by which we keep the flesh from resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the negative side, we should believe in the co-crucifixion of the cross for the elimination of a life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the positive side, we should walk according to the Spirit so that the flesh will have no chance to be rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many believers experience the resurrection of their flesh because they fail in this one point.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time we walk contrary to the Holy Spirit, we give opportunity to the flesh to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If in everything we walk according to the Spirit, the flesh will not have any opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A person can read about this way of overcoming the flesh, the sinful nature, from the Bible; he can hear about it from others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But only when he encounters it in his experience will he realize that it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I often tell others that they can experience such a matter the minute they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet for myself, it took me a long time before I experienced it!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times we merely strive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we say that we trust in the cross, thirty percent of the time we trust in ourselves and in our own "reckoning."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many times God allows us to be defeated so that in the end we would realize that nothing is trustworthy in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even our own "reckoning" with which we "reckon" ourselves dead is of no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why it is true to say that as soon as we truly reckon, we have the experience of victory, and it is equally true to say that we enter such experience only through a gradual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers, by now you can understand our two natures and the way to overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After this, you should resolve to walk by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Previously, you have failed in your resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now, you should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen your will, so that it will be able to incline itself to the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The will is like a rudder; it can turn the whole ship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, a rudder that does not work is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After the Holy Spirit has strengthened you, you should exercise this will to walk according to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Remember that the flesh never disappears; it is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you walk by the Holy Spirit, you will be able to crucify the flesh on the cross continually.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Otherwise, the flesh will cause suffering to you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The meaning of walking by the Spirit is to trust in the Holy Spirit in a calm way in everything, so that you will bear the nine-in-one fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord will lead you experientially step by step into the mystery of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, on your part, you should be faithful.</S>
