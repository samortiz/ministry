   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT ALLOWED IN THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul s Epistles do not speak of his spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, they deal with the problems in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the book of 2 Corinthians seems to speak of Paul s personal spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we must read 2 Corinthians to know Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The emphasis of 2 Corinthians, however, deals with the problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul spoke of his spiritual life to solve the problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The person of Paul was totally for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He spoke of his spirituality for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we spoke concerning spirituality to Paul, he might say that he knows only a few things and that he does not understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He knows to save sinners, to build up the church, to labor for the Lord, to learn to live in the Lord s presence, and to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not know anything besides these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Recently, the Gospel Book Room reprinted The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was rather reluctant to agree with this suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee wrote this book, but he was later unwilling to reprint it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not want to reprint it, because it is about a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not want spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the book is too analytical and is prone to draw readers into self-analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the main reason that Brother Nee was not willing to reprint it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee also pointed out another reason to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spiritual Man does not give a vision; it merely focuses on analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A believer can become well-versed in The Spiritual Man but have no vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He can have knowledge concerning the flesh and the spirit and know what is of the mind, the emotion, and the will, but have no vision, no revelation, and no experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GENUINE SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BEING MAINTAINED BY A VISION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hudson Taylor had a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day as he walked by the seashore in England, he looked over the Atlantic Ocean and saw a great imperial state by the shore of the Pacific Ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This state had thousands of souls who needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was when he received a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He forgot about his own spirituality and received this one burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we asked him about his spirituality, he may have said that he did not know what it is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He only knew that he had a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wanted to preach the gospel to the thousands of souls who were perishing daily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It did not matter whether he was an evangelist or whether he knew how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He received a vision, a burden, that was beyond his spiritual learning, and he followed it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every person who wants to be useful to the Lord must learn not to trust in what he has learned but to go beyond it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our spirituality is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we receive a vision from the Lord, the vision will keep us and make us spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is genuine spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The vision will keep us living in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vision will not let us go; it will keep us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In contrast, if we pursue spirituality but do not have a burden from God, the more we pursue, the less spiritual we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the book Fragrant Myrrh was first published, there was a group of brothers and sisters in northern China who imitated Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was even a sister in Taiwan who was quite successful in imitating her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fragrant Myrrh and A Short and Easy Method of Prayer have a particular flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This sister was so successful in imitating Madame Guyon that she had a particular walk and way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever the saints saw her, they would say, Here comes the Fragrant Myrrh ; here comes Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to be clear that this kind of imitated spirituality is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please forgive me for saying that believers who engage in this type of spirituality have a tragic end. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, for instance, had a miserable ending, because she paid too much attention to being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This led her into spiritual warfare in her latter years, and she eventually focused on demons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without a commission from God, we cannot be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without a vision from God, we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot pursue spirituality without a commission and a vision from God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After following the Lord for more than thirty years, I can only say that I do not know what it is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every believer who receives a burden has a glorious ending.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Maybe D. L. Moody was not clear concerning the way of the church, but he was a person who received a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His burden was to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hudson Taylor was not a gospel preacher, but he received a burden, and his end was glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the saints who paid attention to their own spirituality and desired to improve their spirituality did not have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord does not honor our focusing on spirituality.</S>
