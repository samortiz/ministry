   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THREE KINDS OF LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THREE KINDS OF LIVING CONFERENCE 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Evening, January 10, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THREE KINDS OF LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last night we saw the four laws in Romans 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tonight, we will go on to see the three kinds of histories that go on within a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, man is a created being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later man fell, and he became a fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After he is saved, he becomes a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When man was created, he had the created life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the fall, he inherited the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he is saved, he received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The human life is created by God, and it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the law within man is good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After man fell, the life he inherited came from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the law that came with it is an evil law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After man is saved, the life he received came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, the law that came with that life is also of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now, man has become a complicated mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I ask who you are, it will be difficult for you to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you ask who I am, it will be difficult for me to answer also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within me there is God, there is the devil, and there is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Within man there are three elements: the element of God, the element of the devil, and the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THREE KINDS OF LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some hear us saying that within man is the devil, they do not feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I have to ask this: Is there hatred in man?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is, this hatred is surely not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely hatred comes from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that it is not good to lose our temper, but we lose our temper involuntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sin mentioned in Romans 5 to 8 does not refer to the acts of sins, but to a living entity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There it says that sin dwells in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A lifeless thing cannot dwell in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It also says that sin reigns and takes hold of us to do what we do not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we do is not of our own will, but is done by the sin that dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that sin is a living thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Satan entered into man's life, it became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament, after the Israelites were bitten by the fiery serpents, they became poisoned with the serpents' poison.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, after man fell, he inherited Satan's life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The question today is this: By which life are we going to live?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we going to live by the original life, the satanic evil life, or the life of God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be a Christian is not to be an evil person, nor to be a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christian standard is not good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To take good and evil as the standard is to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THREE KINDS OF GOOD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible mentions three kinds of good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first kind is the good that was there when man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The life that man received at the time of creation was a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the law within that life is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second kind of good is the good of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The life that Satan put within man causes him to sin, on the one hand, and to do good, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A fallen man can also be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A proud man offends God, but a humble man offends God even more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To honor one's parents is good, but Satan instigates man to oppose God and ignore God through his honoring of his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This good therefore comes from the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The third kind of good is that which is produced by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of good transcends man's original good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people cannot distinguish between these three kinds of good in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The good works described in Ephesians 2 are different from the good which one wills to do in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The good in Romans 7 refers to the good that was there when we were created.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The good works in Ephesians 2 refer to the good that is God's life living through the Christians.</S>
