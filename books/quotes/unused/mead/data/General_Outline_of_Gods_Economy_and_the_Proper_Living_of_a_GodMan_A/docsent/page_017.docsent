   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 1:22-23; 4:4; Col 1:18; 2:19; 3:15; 1 Tim 3:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: O Lord, we still look to You for Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We really have nothing and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apart from You we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we truly need You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We pray that You would save us from speaking any unnecessary words and give us fresh words with fresh light, fresh vision, and fresh supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We worship You from the depths of our being that You are and we are not; You are everything and we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we are here in the place of death looking to You that we may live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cleanse us with Your precious blood and resist the enemy's attack for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, You know Your enemy; we accuse him before You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All our hardships are from him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord, rebuke him on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Destroy him for us in these days of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was already destroyed on the cross; we ask You to destroy his power of darkness and all the unclean spirits and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Draw a line around Your recovery with Your blood so that the enemy, Satan, cannot go even one step beyond the line which You have fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We realize that You have given us lessons for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, we ask You not to allow Your enemy to exceed the limit; rather, restrict him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Under Your precious blood we tell him, "May the Lord rebuke you, and may He restrict you!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My burden in this message is for us to see the Body of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are too familiar with these two terms.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Very few can answer accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we need to ask ourselves what the Body of Christ actually is and what the church actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible the Body of Christ is referred to only in the Epistles of Paul; it is not even mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, only four of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul speak concerning the Body of Christ: Romans mentions it only in one place; 1 Corinthians deals with it to a great extent; Ephesians covers it to a lesser extent; and Colossians is the last book dealing with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, if we desire to know the Body of Christ, we must have a thorough study of these four Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because so many things are covered in these four Epistles, the readers of the Bible are easily distracted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose you go to a jewelry store to buy something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If too many items are on display, your eyes are dazzled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, all the salespersons have been trained to show the customers only one item at a time instead of showing many items all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The biggest problem with us who read the Bible is that we are often distracted by the great number of items dealt with in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when we study the Bible, we must learn one thing we should grasp the main points of the Bible and not be distracted by many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Romans</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans, Paul mentions the Body of Christ only in one place, and that is in 12:4-5, which says, "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the only place you can find in Romans that mentions the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Bible readers come to Romans, it is very difficult for them not to be distracted by the other things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must grasp the main points of Romans, study the book slowly to familiarize yourself with it, and have a thorough knowledge of the intrinsic significance of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you will see that among all the main points and items in Romans, the most important thing is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We say that God became man that man may become God, but what is the purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose is to produce the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all know that Romans speaks first concerning man's sinfulness, then concerning God's justification, sanctification, etc., and, lastly, concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a connecting line through the Bible, and that is the Body of Christ, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The entire Bible of sixty-six books covers a great number of items; eventually, it refers to the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, in view of this line, the center of Romans is the Body of Christ.</S>
