   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From chapters forty-one through sixty-six, Christ is revealed as the Servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These twenty-six chapters cover this one person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to cover the revelation of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in chapters forty-one through fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these ten chapters there are four servants of God Cyrus, the Gentile king; Israel, God's chosen corporate people; Isaiah, God's wonderful prophet; and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are four, but eventually they are one, so they are four-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to consider what these servants as types of Christ did and what Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They surely were one with God to carry out His commission to build the temple as the center and reality of God's interest on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today's temple in the New Testament is the church 1 Cor 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is not a physical building with a tower and a bell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul tells us that the church is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the Old and New Testaments talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in the New Testament, Paul tells us that the church was hidden in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a mystery Eph 3:4-5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the church was hidden in appearance in the Old Testament, in type it was not hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eve, for example, was the wife of Adam to be the type of the church as Christ's counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to know the church, we need to know the type of Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eve as the counterpart of Adam has a number of very significant points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eve was built with Adam's rib Gen 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God used this rib to build a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eve was out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This signifies that the church is something out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the church was not created.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church was built up with something that has come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the type of Eve, we could not understand the church that well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eve was out of Adam and eventually went back to Adam to be one flesh with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a good picture of the church in a type.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Old Testament is full of types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament speaks of the church as the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 and the house of God, the household of God Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The house, the dwelling place, is also the household, those who dwell in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church as the household is composed of the sons of God Gal 3:26 , the members of Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is also the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 and the new man 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the church is the kingdom of God, the house of God, the household of God, the sons of God, the members of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new man is enlarged to be the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the holy city, the tabernacle of God and the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of these aspects of the church can be seen in typology in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul said the church was hidden as a mystery, but the church is not hidden in the types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ from the types in the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Isaiah, God has four servants: Cyrus, Israel, Isaiah, and Jesus Christ, the coming Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What did they do?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They built up a city, that is, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The city is a symbol of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They also built up the temple, and the temple is a symbol of God's house with God's people as God's household.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Israel was God's people, and Isaiah and Christ were both a part of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were both Jewish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Hosea 11:1 Israel refers to Christ Matt 2:15 .</S>
