GOD NOW SAVING US IN THE LIFE OF HIS SON</H2><P>God is now saving us in the life of His Son. Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled." Here it is not only the salvation of life, but also the salvation of life in our daily life. Ephesians 2:5 says that we were saved at the time we believed by being made alive. Romans 5:10 says that after we have been saved by being made alive, God is still saving us by the life of Christ. This is our daily salvation. The salvation of life in Ephesians 2 is the saving at the time we believe, and in Romans 5 it is the saving in our daily life continually, day by day. This saving life is saving us all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. CHRIST NOW BEING OUR LIFE AND LIVING IN US</H2><P>Christ is now our life and He is living in us. Colossians 3:4a speaks of Christ who is our life, and Galatians 2:20 says that Christ lives in us. Christ is now our life and is now living in us to save us throughout the day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE<br>FREEING US FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</H2><P>Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and of death. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous function of Christ's resurrection life. The reality of this resurrection life is the Spirit, so the Spirit is called the Spirit of life. The spontaneous function of Christ's resurrection life is called the law of the Spirit of life. This law, this spontaneous function, frees us from the law of sin and of death. This is the salvation by and of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. EATING THE BREAD OF LIFE,<br>DRINKING THE WATER OF LIFE, AND LIVING<br>BY THE SON OF GOD AS OUR LIFE</H2><P>We need to be those who eat the bread of life, drink the water of life, and live by the Son of God as our life (John 6:35, 57b; 7:37-39; Rev. 21:6b; 22:17b). In this last point we have to stress that what we need today in order to participate in this salvation of life is to eat the bread of life, to drink the water of life, and to live by Christ as our life. Then we are enjoying and experiencing the salvation of life.</P><P>We need to pay our attention to the focus of this message: God's salvation is not only by the death of Christ but also by His life to save us from both sin and death.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Life &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
