He said, "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well." These two verses cover the matter of miracles. How should we view these two verses?</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>We have to pay attention to one thing: No one can make a performance out of any part of God's Word, and no part of God's Word can be performed by man. Man is incapable of performing not only these two verses in Mark 16 but also any part of the Scriptures. God answered the prayer of Elijah on Mount Carmel by sending down fire, but this was only for the purpose of proving that Jehovah was God and that Baal was not God (1 Kings 18:30-39). God is willing to use miracles to prove Himself and prove that He is God. But He is not willing to allow man to use miracles as a kind of performance. Some try to perform the verses in Mark 16, but God does not honor their performance; He allows them to fail. You cannot say that they do not believe in the word of Mark 16; they believe. But God will not vindicate them; He will not prove Himself to them because He is God. He only does what He wants to do; He will not work according to man's wish.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>We have to remember a spiritual principle: Faith is a spontaneous and effortless thing. Christians who are immature in their faith find it very strenuous to make God answer their prayers. Every time they try to get an answer from God, they have to pump up much faith. They have to consciously exercise their faith. It seems as if they are saying, "I am believing! I am believing!" Although their prayers are answered, they become worn out in their believing. After they learn the proper lesson, they still pray, they still believe, and God answers their prayer. But they no longer have to exert much effort. They pray spontaneously, and God answers their prayers spontaneously. Previously they exerted considerable strength to believe; it seemed as if their heart and energy were drained through such an exercise of faith. They wanted to believe, yet they could not believe. They did not find faith in themselves, and they tired themselves out by such believing. But after they learn the lesson, their faith is spontaneous; it becomes an effortless faith.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Faith is spontaneous, and so are miracles. Those who perform miracles are never conscious that they are performing miracles. To those who have faith in God, miracles are ordinary things. Only those who are far from God think that miracles are something extraordinary. Those who live in the presence of God and who are near God do not think that miracles are extraordinary.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have read the story of the Israelites' crossing the Red Sea. The first time we read the story, we thought that it was an extraordinary event. It was a tremendous thing for so many people to cross the Red Sea at one time! Yet what did the Israelites say? The Bible does not record that they exclaimed, "What a wonder! The sea is about to divide itself!", while they were still on the [Egyptian] side of the sea. Nor did they say, "Behold, what a miracle!" Only after they arrived at the other side did they begin to make a song and sing. They realized that it was a great miracle only as they looked back. The same is true with believers today. While God is performing a miracle for them, they do not realize that it is a miracle. Only when they look back do they realize that they have experienced a miracle. Brothers and sisters, consider the many times that you were sick and God healed you. Did you feel something extraordinary at the time you were healed? No. When you encountered difficulties and God delivered you, were you conscious that something momentous had occurred at the time of His deliverance? No. Only when you looked back did you realize that great things had happened. Even the looking back is spontaneous; one does not look back consciously.</p><p>Some have misunderstood the words in Mark 16:17-18. They look at these two verses with human eyes and consider them as something extraordinary. But brothers and sisters, once we consider God, we will not feel that there is anything extraordinary about them. These are very small acts compared with the Israelites' crossing the Red Sea. Does this mean that a believer can take poison every day and not die? No. If a man purposefully tries to take poison, he will surely die. These verses tell us that if we know what kind of God He is and the power of God, we will realize that there is nothing He cannot do. Miracles are not the result of a strenuous exercise of man's faith. Miracles are the manifestation of the power of God. God is the only One who does wondrous things; when He works, we have miracles. Once God moves His hand, we no longer feel that miracles are a difficult thing. The trouble today is that man views miracles from a distance that is far from God; therefore, miracles are regarded as something spectacular. Those who are near God realize that miracles are a common thing in the house of God.</p><p>There was a girl who lived by the sea and whose relatives were fishers. Later she married a man from the mountains. The mountain people were secluded and much poorer; they had a meager living. One day her father-in-law became very angry with her, and he condemned her for not being thrifty and for squandering the household goods because she ate one crab within three days. He angrily went to his in-laws, who invited him to stay for supper. He saw many dishes of crab at the table, and when he looked at the porch, countless crab shells could be seen. When he saw this, he decided not to complain anymore and returned home. Many people value miracles in the same way that the father-in-law valued crabs. They experience a miracle once every ten or thirty years. Therefore, they consider a miracle as a rare thing. But those who live before God consider miracles to be an ordinary thing. God's hand is the source of the miracles, and God Himself is constantly performing miracles.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
