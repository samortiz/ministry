   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In His human living, He lived in Nazareth in a carpenter's home for thirty years, and He ministered for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He was a man who was altogether not glorious and even very lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, He was looked down upon and despised by many people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some who despised Him said, "Is not this the carpenter....?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was not a glorious, divine carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If He were, He would have become a great attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the Jews would have streamed to Him in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when He came out, He had no outward beauty or comeliness for people to pay attention to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His human shell concealed His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shell was altogether not handsome, beautiful, or comely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that He was a person with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine nature was glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once, on a high mountain, He was transfigured for a short time Matt 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Besides that short time, His divinity was concealed within His humanity for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But on the mount of His transfiguration, the inner glory within Him swallowed up His outer humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then He became glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was a prefigure of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was in a glorious divine nature and in a very low human nature for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then He died, and His death broke His human shell and released the inner, glorious, divine life John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three days, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He became incarnated, He put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then when He was resurrected, He brought His humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Andrew Murray said that when Christ was resurrected, He sanctified His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means He made His humanity divine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He uplifted the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ in His incarnation brought God into humanity, and in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Andrew Murray used the word interwoven to describe this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By becoming incarnated and by being resurrected, Christ did an interweaving work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He interwove divinity into humanity and humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is similar to the interweaving of two types of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Silk may be interwoven with cotton to produce a textile.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot say that this textile is only silk or only cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is an interweaving of silk and cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In like manner, Christ is the interweaving of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was only God before His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after His incarnation and through His resurrection, He became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is now in humanity, and man is now in divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a kind of interweaving.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Divinity was interwoven into humanity, and humanity was interwoven into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, divinity and humanity have become an interwoven cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, today we are wearing this cloth!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reference to the resurrection of Christ, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Spirit is the very essence, the very element, and the very reality of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The resurrected Christ today is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The pneumatic Christ is Christ as the pneuma, and the pneuma is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to realize that before Christ's resurrection there were the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament and then the Holy Spirit in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after His resurrection, Acts 16:7b speaks of the Spirit of Jesus, and Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is "the Spirit" mentioned in John 7:39, the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ.</S>
