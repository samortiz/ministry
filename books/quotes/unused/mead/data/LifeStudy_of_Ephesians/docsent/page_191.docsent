   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BLESSING A. Peace and Love</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 23 and 24 are Paul s blessing: Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the opening of the book, the apostle s greeting is with grace first as the enjoyment and then peace as the result of the enjoyment 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at the conclusion it is the other way around, from the result, which is in peace, to the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his opening word Paul spoke only of grace and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his concluding word, he not only changes the order of grace and peace, but also mentions love with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is important to see why grace and peace are reversed and why love with faith was included.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that grace is the enjoyment of the Lord and that peace is the result of this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This book opens with grace, with the enjoyment of the Lord Himself as our life, life supply, and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But eventually this Epistle brings us into peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, after we have come into peace, we still need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We enter into peace through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now as we are enjoying peace, we need more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It also indicates that our experience is from grace to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But why is love inserted between peace and grace?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No other epistle written by Paul has such an insertion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason for this insertion is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The phrase in love is used six times in this book 1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This connects this Epistle to Christ s word to the church in Ephesus in Revelation 2:1-7.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There the Lord rebukes the church because she left her first love v. 4 . The problem with the church at Ephesus was not the lack of works or knowledge, but the loss of the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Paul realized that love is crucial, he spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This love is from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that love does not originate with us; it originates with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, however, God s love becomes our love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason Paul speaks, in verse 24, of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s love to us becomes our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peace is maintained by this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By living in the intimacy of God s presence, love comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then this love returns to the Lord and becomes our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this traffic of love, peace is maintained, and we are preserved in the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason Paul speaks of peace, love, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Notice that in verse 23 Paul uses the phrase love with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here, in contrast to 1 Timothy 1:14, he does not speak of love and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Love and faith are the two means by which we partake of Christ and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith is related to our receiving of Christ John 1:12 , and love is related to our enjoying Him John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Gospel of John we are firstly told to believe in the Son in order to have eternal life 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Gospel of John also emphasizes love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter twenty-one the Lord asks Peter concerning his love for Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, in John 14:23 the Lord speaks of the Father and the Son making an abode with the one who loves the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, by faith we receive the Lord Jesus and by love we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, in 1 Timothy 1:14 Paul puts faith and love together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Paul also speaks of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse he encourages the saints to put on the breastplate of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Comparing this verse to Ephesians 6:14, we see that there are two kinds of breastplates, the one for our daily living and the other for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For our daily living we need the breastplate of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Faith and love are both tender; they are signified in the Bible by the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such tender parts of our being, our spiritual breasts, need to be covered with the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By means of the breastplate, our faith and love, which are necessary for a proper Christian life, are preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The breastplate of righteousness in 6:14, on the contrary, is for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we take part in spiritual warfare, our conscience must be protected from Satan s accusation by the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The verses concerning faith and love in the Gospel of John, 1 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy indicate that faith and love go together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But in 6:23 Paul does not say faith and love, nor love and faith, but love with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that we need faith to match, support, and serve our love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Galatians 5:6, faith operates through love.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This operation is very delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Galatians, a book that emphasizes justification by faith, we are told in 5:6 that in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have you ever realized that believing in the Lord Jesus is a matter of love?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do you know that your faith operates through love?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A person who hears the gospel, repents, and then comes to appreciate the Lord Jesus and feels that He is altogether lovable, will have a strong faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This faith operates through his love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more we love the Lord, the stronger will be our faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is Paul s thought in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ephesians, however, emphasizes love, not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to Galatians, the more we appreciate the Lord Jesus and love Him, the more we shall believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But in Ephesians Paul s concern is not salvation, but continuation and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This requires love with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If our faith is weakened because we accept doubts and questions, we shall find it difficult to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever faith is damaged, love will be damaged also.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In order to continue in fellowship with the Lord through loving Him, we need a strong faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we need both the faith that operates through love and the love that is with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have pointed out that love is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that love is on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Faith, on the contrary, is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, the phrase love with faith implies traffic between God and us and between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Love is from God to us, and faith is from us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God gives us love, and we respond with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the traffic between love and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Through this traffic peace remains our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are kept in peace by God s love coming to us and by our faith going to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>B. Grace with All Those Who Love</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our Lord Jesus Christ in Incorruption</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This traffic will also keep us in grace, in the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In verse 24 Paul says, Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Grace is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God s eternal purpose and solves God s problem with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is to those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruption, that is, in a condition which is incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our love for the Lord must be incorruptible, immortal, and imperishable.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Such a love is genuine and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The way Paul composed the writing of the blessing in these verses is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Here, at the conclusion of this Epistle, we have been brought into peace.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We remain in this condition of peace by the love which is from God with the faith which is from us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>By this traffic of love with faith we have a continual supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Hallelujah for peace, for love with faith, and for grace!</S>
