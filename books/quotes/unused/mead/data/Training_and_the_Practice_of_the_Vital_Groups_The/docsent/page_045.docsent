   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN A SPIRIT OF PRAYER WITH ENDURANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Always contact people in a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I realize that we all are busy and do not have that much time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may not have much opportunity to separate time to pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, if you can do this, it is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But even while you are driving to work, you can pray, "Lord, I don't know whom I should contact today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Give me one or two to contact."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then you can contact people in a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever you contact people, always grasp the opportunity to say something concerning Christ, to sow a seed of Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a sowing word can never be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>People may not respond right now, but eventually they will respond.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may even respond at the end of their life, showing that the seed of Christ sown into people is never in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why Paul told us in 1 Corinthians 15:58 to "be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To abound is to increase and to multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to labor we need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul indicated that we need to work, to labor, with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because whatever we do in the Lord will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If He would give us the result right now, that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if not, we still have the faith that whatever we do in Him and for Him will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to live a normal Christian life, three things are very much needed: 1 seeking after the Lord; 2 coming to the meetings; and 3 going to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you want to be a normal Christian, just do these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we should seek after the Lord for His life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should desire to experience Him, to grow in Him, to live Him, and to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He lives in me, so I live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we need to come to the weekly meetings of the church and go to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our meaning for being on this earth is not just to make a living for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our living on this earth is for the Lord, so that we can contact people and so that He can gain people through us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every year we should endeavor to gain someone for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the real meaning of life for us Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our speaking to people, we should always remember to sow the seed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Say something from the Bible and sow the word into your contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This seed will remain in them, and our work will never be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Also, when we go to visit people, we should bring the gospel tracts we have prepared and distribute them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Something through these pages will be sown into our contacts and also into their friends and family members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Someone to whom you give a tract may leave it on his coffee table, and the other members of his family may read it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the sowing of the seed of the gospel.</S>
