   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX TEN FOUR PLANES OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is an excerpt from Life Out of Death, a book by Jessie Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was originally published by The Overcomer Literature Trust, Parkston, Poole, Dorset, England.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are four planes broadly speaking in the spiritual life of the believer, and of the Christian worker: The first plane we may call the "evangelistic" plane; that is, the plane where the soul knows the new birth; knows that he has eternal life in Christ; where he becomes a soul winner, preaches salvation from the penalty of sin, and is used to lead others to Christ; where the entire objective is winning souls for Christ; where he is faithful in proclaiming the gospel of salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then there is the second plane, which may be called the "revival" plane; or the stage in personal experience where the believer receives the fulness of the Holy Spirit, learns to know Him and to obey Him; to rely upon Him and to look to Him to work as he co-operates with Him, and is used to lead others into the experience of the fulness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then there is the third plane, which we may call the plane of the "path of the cross", where the believer experimentally apprehends his position in Romans 6 in fellowship with Christ's death; is brought into "conformity" to His death Philippians 3:10 ; he learns the fellowship of His sufferings, and is led to walk in the path of the Cross in every detail of practical life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the believer is able to interpret to others the way of the Cross, and to lead others to know Romans 6 and 2 Corinthians 4:10-12 in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fourth plane is the plane of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is really the "ascension" plane, where the believer knows his union with Christ, seated with Him "far above all principality and power"; and where, in service, he is in aggressive warfare against the powers of darkness; learns to have spiritual discernment to detect the working of the devil; and learns the authority of Christ over all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 10:19.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Or to put it concisely the first is the plane of salvation, or the new life; the second is the plane of the Spirit; the third is the plane of victory over sin; the fourth is the plane of victory over the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The individual believer, if he goes forward in the Christian life with God, is generally not always led just in this order also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, he receives salvation; second, he receives the Holy Ghost; third he is led along the path of the Cross; fourth, he walks in the path of conflict and victory, resulting in "power" over all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The individual worker, also, finds he is used in these four planes of service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, he is used to lead others to Christ; second, he is used to lead them into the fulness of the Spirit; third, he is used to interpret to them the path of the Cross; and fourth, to discern the devices and workings of the devil, and to have power over "all the power of the enemy", through union with Christ on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Madame Guyon truly says that in every plane of the spiritual life there is a beginning, working out, and a consummation of the life in that degree, followed by a passage into the next plane, where there is again a beginning, a working out, a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In each plane you appear to learn the very same lessons over again, but they are all being learned in a deeper degree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For instance, in the first plane you learn the way of faith in Christ as Saviour, and then you have to learn to exercise faith again in the next plane, and again in the next.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is just as hard to learn the lesson of bare faith in the fourth plane as in the first, and yet, as you look back, you can see the hard lessons of the first plane are now quite simple and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Further, it is true that, speaking generally, it often takes years to get through each plane!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you pass into a new plane of the spiritual life, it is often with some great conscious "blessing".</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A God-given experience of fulness in Christ, which may be described as a "taste" of what God has for you in that plane in its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For instance, you get a revelation of the ascension life, seated with Christ in the heavenly places, and the joy and light of it is so real, that you think you will never come down again to the lower planes you now leave behind you, but in a brief while of weeks, or months, the "conscious" blessing lasting according to the extent of the revelation and its power apparently disappears, and you perhaps struggle to regain what you think you have lost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now you have to fight by bare faith, to hold the ground you have taken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then follows what may be called a "tunnel" experience, when you go through test upon test; in which, perhaps, you may think you fail, but through all you find there is advancement, and final emergence into the full consummation of that specific plane of the spiritual life, where you understand the way of abiding; for in the working into you of that life by the "tunnel" experience, God has removed what stands in the way of the permanent abiding in that stage of the knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>See Romans 5:2-5, A.V. and R.V.</S>
