<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">CO-WORKERS' MEETING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 21, 1936, morning<br />Place: Amoy</h1><p class="indent1">(Editor's Note: This chapter is an excerpt of notes from a co-workers' meeting. Most of the notes were reports by different co-workers concerning the work in various places. Only the portions containing Watchman Nee's words of fellowship, his answers to questions, and related portions of the meeting pertinent to his fellowship have been included.)</p><p>Brother Kuo asked: Presently, I am a responsible brother in my locality. If the Lord delays and no mature ones move to our locality, should we try to produce responsible brothers out of our own locality?</p><p>Brother Nee answered: The elders of each local assembly must bear the responsibility of edifying the brothers in their own locality. We find this in Paul's Epistles to Timothy and the book of Hebrews.</p><p>Those who think that they are able to work and only trust in themselves will not have the blessing of the Lord on their work. A man must be dealt with by the Lord to the extent that he no longer acts by his own strength, but acts solely by God's strength. He must learn to continually trust in God. When he does, God will use him. When Moses first volunteered to work for God, he appeared to be very strong. God had to do something to force him out of Egypt, and he became a shepherd in the wilderness at Sinai. Later, when he acknowledged that he could do nothing, God came in to call him to His work.</p><p>Natural ability cannot be our capital for spiritual work. In the eyes of God, a Christian is one who does not look at himself. He does not become disappointed by looking at his own weaknesses, nor proud by looking at his own strengths. A worker of God must not look at himself. He must not look at his weaknesses or his strengths. God can use a donkey to utter human words, and you are better than a donkey. This is a fact. What is impossible with man is possible with God. We must learn not to look at ourselves.</p><p>If you want to work for God, you must seriously seek for light, revelation, and gift from Him. One brother in Shanghai sought for the power of the Holy Spirit again and again, but was not able to obtain it. Later, he asked a few brothers and sisters to pray for him. He said, "Some gifts are designed especially for some people. Lord, Your Spirit can work through a donkey, and I believe that You can use me also." Soon after this he experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Some have asked Andrew Murray about humility. Many people think that considering oneself to be small is being humble, and considering oneself great is being proud. But Andrew Murray answered that humility is not considering oneself at all, whereas being proud is considering oneself.</p><p>Brother Chung asked: I feel that I need to go to Fu-ching.</p><p>Brother Nee answered: Are you clear that this is the Lord's will?</p><p>Brother Chung answered: I have prayed and asked the Lord about it.</p><p>Brother Nee answered: It is not enough to say that you have made a telephone call. You must receive an answer to your call. Many people know that they should pray when something happens. But after they pray, they do not know whether God has answered their prayer. Not only must we pray, we must also receive definite revelation from the Lord and be clear of His leading.</p><p>Brother Chung should also learn to join ranks with others and go on together. One must not be strong-willed; rather, he must cooperate and work together with others.</p><p>Brother Jin-shiu Han fellowshipped: Brother Nee has spoken on the iniquity of the sanctuary. I received much help from that message. I want to consecrate myself to God to enable Him to deal with me more. I hope to go to Shanghai to receive more training.</p><p>Brother Nee's fellowship: If you want the Lord to enlighten you, you must have a determination to overturn all the wrong things that you have built up in the past. Many sins need to be dealt with. You have to ask the Lord to give you the light to remove all the wrong things. No one can say that he has dealt with his sins for the last time. It is not enough to just confess your sins before men. Before the Lord, you must condemn yourself and hate yourself for your sins. You must go through a clearinghouse experience with respect to your sins once in a while. If a brother has not experienced this for two or three months, he is probably not right with the Lord.</p><p>[Brother Yau-yee Wang explained how the Lord had been leading him in the work. He related two great crises he had encountered: (1) his ulceration of blood, and (2) his encounter with bandits.]</p><p>Brother Nee's fellowship: If you are clear about the Lord's leading within, you should not be influenced by outward circumstances. Whether or not the environment works against you is not a reliable sign. The most important thing is whether or not there is the anointing within. If you are clear about the Lord's leading within, nothing should shake you.</p><p>Some things require the Lord's guidance only once, and the matter is settled forever. Other things require His guidance again and again. For example, the matter of marriage is a once-for-all decision. But regarding where you should eat, either in a restaurant or at home, there is no one-time rule.</p><p>Brother Teng fellowshipped: We have over ten people at the bread-breaking table meeting. There are more at the message meetings, about seventy to eighty people. Even when the attendance is low, we still have fifty to sixty.</p><p>Brother Nee's word: Please render the brothers some training right away. There is no need to ask brothers from other localities to come to help you. Moreover, you have to teach the young brothers to submit to the elderly ones.</p><p>Brother Ke Lien-min's fellowship: I feel that I am too young and need more training. I will go to Pu-Tien to join Brother Tsai in his work. I feel that a young one must follow an elderly one. Otherwise, he will suffer great loss spiritually.</p><p>Brother Nee's word: Faith is not making sure that every outward thing is safe and sound before doing anything. Faith is related to one's inward condition. If one is on the right path inwardly, he should go according to the Lord's leading.</p><p>After George MÃ¼ller started his first orphanage, someone told him not to move too fast. But God's way is higher than our way. Later, he quickly started a second and a third orphanage. While he was starting the first, he encountered many difficulties. But he did not care for any of them, because he was clear that he was following the Lord's leading. Man's word could not influence him, nor could the environment change him.</p><p>The Acts of the Apostles is a book of "acting," not a book of "sitting." The workers of the Lord should not remain in one place. We should follow the Lord's leading to work in other places. For example, the workers in Shanghai should go to other places and leave the responsibility of the church in Shanghai to the local brothers. When the workers return, they may find the local condition better than before.</p>
