   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNTO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 8 Peter speaks of not being idle or unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The constitution with the spiritual virtues as its constituents advances in many steps toward the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a view to the full realization of the all-inclusive embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this section of the Word, three prepositions are used regarding the relationship of the experience of life to spiritual knowledge: in, in verse 2, referring to the sphere of the knowledge; through, in verse 3, referring to the channel of the knowledge; and unto, in verse 8, referring to the knowledge in view as a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our experiential knowledge of the Lord increases according to the degree of our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BEING SHORTSIGHTED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 9 Peter says, For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted, having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As in verse 8, these things refers to all the virtues covered in verses 5 through 7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The one in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word rendered shortsighted comes from the root word that means to close the eyes due to strong light; hence, to be shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be thus shortsighted is to be spiritually blind, unable to see something further in the divine life and divine nature of the Triune God dispensed into the believers as their bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Literally, the Greek word rendered having forgotten means taking forgetfulness, that is, willing to forget the experience of the cleansing of past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That cleansing was for us to go on in the divine life by partaking of the divine nature to reach its maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For one to forget the cleansing of his past sins does not mean that he denies the faithful profession he made when he believed in Christ and was baptized into Him, nor does it mean that he loses the assurance of salvation which he received at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it is to neglect what the initiation of salvation meant to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>DILIGENT TO MAKE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OUR CALLING AND SELECTION FIRM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 10 Peter continues, Wherefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here to be diligent is to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This makes God s calling and selection of us firm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are diligent to develop the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7, we shall confirm, make sure, our calling and selection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We shall never doubt that we have been called by God and selected by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, some may question whether God has chosen them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason they have doubt concerning this matter is that they lack the virtues listed by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we develop these virtues and are constituted of them, we shall have the confirmation that we have been called and selected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to make our calling and selection firm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, in doing these things we shall never stumble, because we have been thoroughly constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ENTRANCE INTO THE ETERNAL KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 11 Peter concludes, For so shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The bountiful supply we enjoy in the development of the divine life and divine nature will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It will enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom with all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues unto the splendid glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not merely to be saved to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The eternal kingdom in this verse refers to the kingdom of God given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Dan 7:13-14 , which will be manifested at His coming back Luke 19:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature, so that they may participate, in the millennium, in His kingship in God s glory 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God s eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ 1 Pet 5:10; 1 Thes 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second Peter 1:11 indicates that we may have an entrance richly and bountifully supplied into the kingdom of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, a good number of Christians will not have such an entrance, because they have never built up this entrance by developing the divine seed unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are not constituted of the divine virtues, we shall not be able to build up such an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we have the development of the divine life and are constituted of the elements of the divine nature, a rich and bountiful entrance into the coming kingdom will be supplied to us.</S>
