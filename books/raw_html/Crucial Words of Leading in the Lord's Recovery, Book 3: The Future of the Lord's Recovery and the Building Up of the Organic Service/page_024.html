	 <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY FLOURISHING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In America</h2>
<p>I never thought that I would go to America. In 1938 a saint from Beijing sent me two checks; one check was for a round-trip ticket to America, and the other was to cover the living expenses for my wife and children in China for one year. The saint who sent the checks said that she had received the leading from the Lord and wanted me to go to America. I replied that I did not have the burden to go to America, and I asked her what I should do with the checks. She insisted that I keep the checks because one day the Lord would send me to America. In 1958 I was invited to England and Denmark, and I passed through the United States on my way to Europe, but I did not labor in America.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s leading was beyond what I could imagine. In 1949, when the Lord brought me to Taiwan, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was only among the Chinese-speaking saints; there were approximately one hundred churches in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. In 1962 I was led by the Lord to go to America to begin the work there, and in 1963 I began to put out <em>The Stream</em> magazine in English. I also published books in English. Due to these few English publications, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery quickly spread to all five continents. Of course, it first spread in America. Now there are more than ninety churches scattered across America. From the East Coast to the West Coast, the situation is very promising even though their numbers are not large. All kinds of people have been gained, and we can clearly see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Europe</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery also went to Germany. Although Germany is not an English-speaking country, German is related to English; hence, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was able to go to Germany by means of the English language. Not long after the recovery went to Germany, it spread to several other countries, such as England, France, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and even Finland. There is a small church in Helsinki, Finland. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is still spreading in Europe. Last year and this year, we had trainings in Germany with more than eight hundred brothers and sisters meeting together. Most of them came from Germany, but a few of them came from other nearby countries. It was very encouraging. The saints who went from Taiwan thought that they would encourage the saints from Europe, but in the end they were encouraged by the saints from Europe. This strengthened the European saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Russia</h2>
<p>In Europe the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been translated into several different languages. Our books have not only been translated into German, French, and Spanish; they have also been translated into Russian. The book <em>The Economy of God</em> has been printed in Russian and sent to Russia. In addition, approximately ten booklets have also been translated into Russian and sent to Russia. The Lord arranged for a Russian-speaking Jewish scholar to be a professor at a university near Seattle, Washington. He has doctorate degrees in both Russian and English, and he is happy to help us translate our spiritual publications. There is also a Russian sister in America who is helping our translator with the spiritual terms. They are currently translating <em>The Experience of Life</em> and other books of this category. A responsible brother from Seattle recently went to Russia to observe the situation. He discovered that there are many underground churches. The believers in these churches told him that they already have the Bible, but what they really needed was spiritual books like the ones he brought them. I hope that we will pray much for this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In England</h2>
<p>The University of Manchester in England has a large body of students and a sizable campus. Recently, their librarian wrote a letter to the Living Stream Ministry in America. In his letter he said that he had received a few of the books put out by the Living Stream Ministry, which had been sent to him by the saints in the church in Blackpool. He enjoyed reading the books, and he requested that we send them a set of all our publications in Chinese, English, and any other language. He wants to put our publications in the university library. We immediately sent him copies of all our publications in Chinese, English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Korean, and even Filipino. This was the Lord&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Central and South America</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has also gone to Central America, South America, and Mexico. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is flourishing in the mountainous region in Mexico. Our work, including our publications and videos, cannot keep up with the demand. They are on fire with zeal, and churches have been raised up in many places. There are now more than fifty churches in Mexico. We sent them six or seven video players, and the localities take turns watching the Life-study training tapes. This has been very effective.</p>
<p>In Brazil there is an amazing desire for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The brothers there purchased a large piece of property in a town that is a two-hour drive from Sao Paulo. In 1981 they finished building a meeting hall that can seat more than one thousand people. Recently, they purchased an old hospital in Sao Paulo, and they converted it into a big meeting hall. This is where the literature and printing work is done.</p>
<p>The testimony in Brazil began in 1959 when a few brothers from Taiwan and the Philippines migrated there. However, it was not until I went there in 1965 that they began to meet as the church. There were many Christians, and the brothers were desirous to meet with them as the local church. But after much consideration we felt that the local believers had a very strong religious, denominational atmosphere and that it was impossible for us to bear the one testimony together with them. Hence, in 1965 we began to meet as the church. In those days there were no Brazilian saints meeting with us; all the saints were Chinese, and the meetings were in Chinese.</p>
<p>I went there again in 1970 and then again fourteen years later in 1984. I was surprised by the progress that had been made. More than eleven hundred brothers and sisters attended the meetings, and more than one thousand of them were local Brazilians. There were only forty or fifty Chinese saints. In addition, there were fifty to sixty from Argentina, and there were others from the neighboring countries of Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia. Most of the Brazilian brothers and sisters have college degrees; several of them were pastors, ministers, or seminarians before they began to meet with us. Some of the saints are also doctors and medical students. The situation there was similar to what I see this time in Taipei. Their sharing was completely according to the contents of the Life-study messages. This proves that the Life-study messages had done a great work within them.</p>
<p>At present there are at least one hundred and fifty churches from Mexico to Brazil. Colombia, a cultured Spanish-speaking country, also has churches. Some brothers have begun meeting in the capital of Guatemala. Before they took the ground, they sent us a letter inviting the brothers and sisters in America to attend their first meeting.</p>
