   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Concerning the False Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Deuteronomy 18:20-22 concerns the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A false prophet was one who spoke a word presumptuously in God's name which God did not command him to speak or who spoke in the name of other gods v. 20a . Such a prophet was to be put to death v. 20b . When a prophet spoke in the name of Jehovah and the thing did not happen, that was the thing which Jehovah had not spoken v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. Concerning the Setting Apart</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of the Cities of Refuge</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children of Israel were to set apart cities of refuge 19:1-13 , cities into which those who had killed others accidentally could escape.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These cities signify God's preparing Christ as a refuge for all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The numbers related to the refuge cities are significant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For convenience, there were to be six refuge cities, three on either side of the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The number six signifies man, who was created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Triune God has come in incarnation to be our refuge; He is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the number two, implied by the fact that there were cities on the two sides of the Jordan, signifies testimony or witness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God embodied in the incarnated Christ has come to the place where we live to be our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of asking us to come where He is, He came to where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason that in preaching the gospel, we should not ask people to come to us; rather, we should bring the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To ask others to come to us is contrary to God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For details on the refuge cities, please see the life-study on Numbers 35:9-34.</S>
