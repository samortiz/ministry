   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL, AN EXAMPLE OF WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 4:21 Paul says, What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By reading this verse we realize that Paul was a person who truly walked in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 1 Corinthians 5:3-5, Paul could even attend a church meeting in his spirit when he was not physically present.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 5:4 he said, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul seemed to be saying, You are gathering at Corinth and I am here in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when you gather together, my spirit meets with you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How much Paul lived in his spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his spirit he could exercise authority in the name of the Lord Jesus to execute the Lord s judgment upon a sinful brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we see how strong in the spirit he was.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 16:18 Paul says, For they have refreshed my spirit and yours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul s spirit was refreshed by the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reveals that Paul continually lived, walked, and worked in his spirit for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Corinthians 2:13 says, I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul also mentions the human spirit in 2 Corinthians 7:13, where he says, Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told the Corinthians that they did a good thing in refreshing the spirit of Paul s co-worker Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 12:18 says, I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul and his co-workers were in the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse does not say that they were one in the Holy Spirit, but in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles constantly lived, walked, moved, worked, and spoke in and from their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, they experienced Christ and had the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only by living and walking in our spirit can we experience Christ for the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a matter of studying the Bible or of reading books.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes books will function as eye openers and render us some help by opening our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But our final decision must be made in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I first came into the church life, I spent several weeks wondering and watching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was constantly thinking and considering in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, after a long period of time, I became finalized in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, This is all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now I forget my consideration and my thinking and make my final decision in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can assure you that there is only one way to experience Christ for the church life it is to be in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wherever you are at home, at school, or on your job you need to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would pray, we must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would function, we must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would have fellowship with the saints, we must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we would preach the gospel to sinners, we must do so in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The key is to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Christian life, the church life, the Lord s work, the proper ministry all must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Talk to the brothers in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Try to lose your temper in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we turn to our spirit, our temper vaporizes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we turn to our spirit, there is no hatred, only love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we turn to our spirit, it is no longer the self, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our spirit there is another world, another sphere, another realm, another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are in spirit everything is different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we are small, we can be in one of two kingdoms: the kingdom in our mind or the kingdom in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we are in our mind, we are in one kingdom, but whenever we turn to our spirit, we are in another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Strictly speaking, we need very little knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We just need to realize that we must live, walk, move, and work in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be burning, zealous, boiling, and aggressive, not in our emotions or in our natural being, but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only this aggressiveness is effectual.</S>
