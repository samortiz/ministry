   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE APPLYING CHRIST AS LIFE IN OUR DAILY LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:4, 1, 14, 17-18; 4:14; 5:39-40; 6:35, 53-57, 63; Col 1:12; 2:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ministry of the apostle John has a special place among the ministries of the apostles, and among all the books of the Bible, his books have a special or particular nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these first few messages we would like to consider the Gospel of John, which has three main points Christ as life, the increase of Christ, and the oneness of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will examine the first point, concerning Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD S ETERNAL INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire Bible and the Gospel of John in particular reveal to us that God s eternal intention is to work Himself into us and be mingled with us so that we may have Him as our life and that He may be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what is eternally in the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to accomplish this intention, the Lord Jesus came to us as the Word of God so that we could receive Him and take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as the Word of God is the definition, explanation, expression, and manifestation of God 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead, which is all that God is, dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, Christ is not only the expression of God but also the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we receive Christ, we receive God Himself as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christ comes into us, He brings God Himself as grace and reality into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 1:17 says that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grace is commonly defined as something given to us by others or something we gain from others free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, real grace is God received and gained by us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle Paul tells us that everything in the universe is refuse and that only God Himself is grace to us Phil 3:8; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus brought God to us so that we might gain and receive the true grace in the universe, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we experience and realize God as grace, He becomes reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God gained by us is grace, and God realized, experienced, and enjoyed by us is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>KNOWING THE PRACTICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO TAKE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can we gain God as grace and experience and realize God as reality?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The book of John tells us that the simplest way for us to gain and experience God is to take Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord made this matter simple by telling us that He is the bread of life for us to eat and the living water for us to drink 6:35; 4:10; 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, if we want to gain and experience God, we must take Christ as our life by eating Christ as our food and drinking Christ as our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may know the doctrine that Christ is the bread of life, but do we know how to actually take Christ as the bread of life into us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do we know the real and practical way to apply Christ as life to our daily living and take Him as our food and drink?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This matter sounds simple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I have discovered that although most of the Lord s children know that Christ is life and that He is the bread of life, they do not know the practical way to take Christ as their bread, and they do not have the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the way to experience, apply, and appropriate Christ in daily life is very simple, most of the Lord s children do not know the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, there is a need among the Lord s children to know the way to take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these messages I do not want to present mere doctrines, because our need is not for mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, our need is to know how to take Christ as life in an experiential and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our physical eating and drinking are very practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, the Lord being the bread of life and the water of life to us are very practical matters and not mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may know the doctrines, but we may not practice applying and appropriating Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I were to ask you how many meals you have each day, you would probably say that you have three meals breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if I were to ask you how many times you had taken Christ as your life today, you would probably give me an uncertain answer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every day we should be very certain that we have experienced Christ as our daily bread.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every day we should be able to point out to the angels and the enemy the number of times we enjoyed Christ, just as we are able to say how many meals we take each day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AS THE REALITY OF EVERY POSITIVE THING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to enjoy Christ in a practical way, we must realize that all the positive physical and material things that we enjoy are not the real things but only shadows and figures that point to the real thing, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you think that the light in your house is the real light?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are not enjoying Christ, you may be in the light of your house, yet you may actually be in darkness, because this light is not the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only a shadow or figure pointing to the real light, which is Christ 1:4; 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have Christ, we have light, and if we do not have Christ, we do not have light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, the food and water we take in every day are not the real food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are shadows, showing us that we need to take in the real food and water, which are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I travel to different places, I often stay in the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, those homes are not my real home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My real home, or dwelling place, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moses realized this, saying in Psalm 90:1, O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes when I am traveling by airplane, I tell the Lord, Lord, I am not in this plane.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am in You.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You are my plane, my hiding place, and my dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must realize that all these material things are shadows pointing to the real thing, which is Christ Himself Col 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While you are breathing, do you realize that the air you are breathing is not the real air?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The real air is Christ Himself John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must constantly breathe Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot stop breathing, because once we stop, we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, we must breathe Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Often while I am walking along the street, I tell the Lord, Lord, this street is not my real way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are my real way; You are the way to me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I do not have You, I do not have the way, but when I have You, I have the way 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we are putting on our clothes in the morning, we should realize that our clothes are not the real clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our real clothing is Christ Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should pray to the Lord, Lord, these clothes are not my real clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are my real clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These clothes are nothing but a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are the reality of these clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I praise You and thank You that You are my covering and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I may be putting on this outward clothing, but in my heart I am putting on You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way to apply Christ while we are putting on our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even when we are drinking a beverage, we must tell the Lord, I do not merely wish to be refreshed by this beverage; I wish to be refreshed by You.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lord, You are my real refreshment cf.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>John 4:14; 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all must experience and apply Christ in such a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not merely learn doctrines and listen to teachings about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, we must experience Christ as our daily necessities and our life supply day by day and even moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord told us, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to eat the Lord so that we will live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have a natural life, but this is not the real life by which we live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is only a shadow that points to the real life, which is Christ Himself 11:25; 14:6; 1 John 5:12; 1 Tim 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Today are we living by our own life or by Christ as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In order to live by Christ as our life, we must forsake, deny, and reject our own life and take Christ as our real life day by day and moment by moment Matt 16:24-25; Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When we are going to visit a friend, we must remember not to do it by our natural life but by Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>While I am speaking the word, in the depth of my heart I am trusting in the Lord, not in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I speak not by my natural man or my natural life but by Christ as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In a sense, we still must live a natural, human life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, we must realize that the real life by which we live before God is not the natural life but Christ Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must realize that our physical life and all the positive material things around us are only shadows; they are not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The reality is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Do you realize that your eyes are not the real eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The real eyes are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do not have Christ, we are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Only when we have Christ are we able to see everything through Christ, by Christ, and in Christ Luke 4:18; John 9:6-7; Rev 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do you realize that even your Bible, though it is the Word of God, is only the written Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The real, living Word is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In John 5:39-40 the Lord told the Pharisees, You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life...Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many people come to the Bible without coming to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They contact the written Word but do not contact the living Word, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When we come to the Scriptures, we should pray, Lord, You are the real Word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I come to contact You through the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You are the living Word and the real Word, and through the written Word I can contact You as the living and real Word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Colossians 2:16-17 says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Eating, drinking, the feasts, the new moon, and the Sabbath are all shadows of Christ as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The new moon is a figure of Christ as our new and fresh start.</S>

   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The feasts, the eating, and the drinking reveal Christ as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should have a feast not merely once every three months or on holidays; we should have a feast moment by moment by enjoying Christ.</S>
