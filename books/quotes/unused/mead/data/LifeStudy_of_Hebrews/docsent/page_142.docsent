   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Ministering in the True Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the High Priest</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the true tabernacle, Christ is ministering as the High Priest 8:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is Christ doing as the High Priest?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is interceding for us that everything which He has accomplished might be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In some of the previous messages we have seen this matter of Christ s heavenly intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may recall how Melchisedec came to minister the bread and wine to Abraham after he had interceded for him behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, Christ, our Melchisedec, is secretly interceding for all who love Him and seek Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As He is interceding for us in the heavens, He is also the all-inclusive and all-pervading Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The all-inclusive Spirit works in us according to Christ s heavenly intercession, motivating the law of life within us to function and causing the standard model, the Firstborn Son of God, to be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is transpiring on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To say this is not guesswork; it is the revelation of God s Holy Word which is shining over us as a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these days, many of us have been under the shining of this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This vision will become a governing vision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord that Christ is ministering in the true tabernacle today!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. Executing the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the interval between His first and second manifestations, Christ is executing the new testament 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To execute the new testament simply means to motivate the law of life within us and to make every bequest of the new will real in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we see what Christ is doing in us today, we shall never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What Christ is doing in us is worthy of eternal remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we get into eternity, we may recall the day we saw the glorious vision of Christ s heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this ministry has been completed, Christ will be manifested the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SECOND MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST A. Apart from Sin</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 28 says that Christ shall appear to those who wait for Him a second time, apart from sin, unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second manifestation of Christ has nothing to do with sin, because sin has already become a history.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As man must die once and be judged after having died v. 27 , so Christ died once to bear man s sins v. 28; 1 Pet 2:24 and suffered the judgment for man on the cross Isa 53:5, 11 . This book very much stresses the fact that sin has been put away by Christ s sacrifice in His first manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since Christ has put away sin in His first appearing 9:26; 1 John 3:5 , His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing whatever to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Unto Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 28 says that Christ will appear a second time unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation here does not refer to the salvation from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It has a wider and higher meaning, covering the following aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the Redemption,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Transfiguration of Our Body</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First of all, the very salvation which Christ will bring to us in His second manifestation is for the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we were saved, we were regenerated in our spirit John 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we are in the process of being transformed in our soul Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then at Christ s second coming for the completion of the salvation of our entire being, He will transfigure our vile body into a glorious one Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That will be the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , the first aspect of Christ s appearing unto salvation in His second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the Deliverance from the Vanity and Slavery</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>of Corruption of the Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second aspect of the salvation by Christ s second coming is the deliverance from the vanity and slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the children of God Rom 8:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The entire old creation has been subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even we who have been saved and who have the enjoyment of the Spirit are also under the vanity and the slavery of corruption of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At His second coming, Christ will free us from this vanity and slavery and deliver us into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For Our Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At His second coming, Christ will glorify us Rom 8:17 , that is, He will bring us into His glory to fulfill the word in Hebrews 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our glorification is the final goal of God s salvation in Christ Rom 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been chosen, predestinated, called, and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we are being sanctified through the process of transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then in His second manifestation, we shall be glorified and reach the final goal of God s salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the third aspect of Christ s coming salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the Full Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In regeneration we were born of God and became the sons of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this new birth we received the divine sonship in our spirit Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After this, we began to enjoy this sonship through the transformation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we are transformed in our soul, the more we enjoy the sonship which has been given to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This sonship will become full when our body of the old creation is transfigured into a body of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that the redemption of our body is the full sonship of our new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will be the fourth aspect of Christ s salvation in His second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the Full Taste of God</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s salvation in Christ is to work Himself into us as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has given to us His Spirit in our spirit as the firstfruit for our enjoyment Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This firstfruit of the Spirit is the foretaste for our enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The full taste will be brought in for our enjoyment by Christ s second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When our body is transfigured and our entire being, spirit, soul, and body, is fully saturated with the divine element of the Triune God, we shall enjoy God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That will be our full taste of God, the last aspect of Christ s coming salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The very salvation which Christ will bring us in His second coming will be such a wider and higher one and will fulfill the final and ultimate goal of God s all-inclusive salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Before His second manifestation, Christ is ministering to us with this goal in view.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His more excellent ministry in the heavens today, the ministry of His kingly and divine priesthood with His heavenly intercession, is building up such a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When He sees that the building up of this wonderful salvation has been accomplished, He will appear the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That will be His second manifestation in God s economy.</S>
