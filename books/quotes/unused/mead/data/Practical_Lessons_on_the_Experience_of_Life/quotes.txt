[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE EXPERIENCE OF REGENERATION 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; Rev 22:1-2; John 10:10; Col 3:4; John 3:16, 36; 5:24; 6:47
[3]  In this series of messages we shall deal with the experience of life.
[4]  If we learn to know what stage and condition of life others are in where they are, what they are, and what their needs are we will know how to definitely help them to go on according to the experiences of the different stages of life.
[5]  HELPING PEOPLE IN A PRACTICAL WAY TO BE REGENERATED Helping Them to Repent and Believe
[6]  In order to contact an unbeliever we must first realize what kind of person he is.
[7]  We may compare this to fishing: We need to know what kind of fish we are after in order to choose the right kind of bait.
[8]  If we use the wrong bait, we may scare the fish away, but if we use the right bait, we will attract the fish.
[9]  HELPING PEOPLE TO HAVE A CLEARANCE OF THEIR PAST
[10]  To help someone to be saved in this way is easy.
[11]  HELPING THEM TO FOLLOW THE INNER CONSCIOUSNESS AND WALK IN THE SPIRIT
[12]  We can say, "Since you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, from now on you must do the Lord's will.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF REGENERATION 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2; Gal 3:13; Eph 1:7; 1 John 1:9; 1 Cor 6:11; Rom 5:10-11; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; John 3:3, 5; 1 John 4:13; 2 Cor 13:5; Rom 8:9; John 14:17; 1 John 5:12; John 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4; Heb 8:10; Rom 8:2; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor 5:17; John 1:12-13; Eph 5:30; Rom 12:5
[14]  The spiritual life is of different stages, and each stage has many spiritual experiences.
[15]  After a person repents and believes repenting before God, confessing his sins, believing in the Lord Jesus, and receiving Him as his Savior the first thing God applies to him is the "sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[16]  After we are cleansed, we are sanctified, that is, separated.
[17]  First Corinthians 6:11 shows us the proper order: "And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
[18]  If we are not separated, if we are still in the heap of sinful people, we cannot be justified.
[19]  This is mentioned in Romans 5:10 and 11, which say, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled, and not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."
[20]  Therefore, after God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life with the intention that man would receive the life signified by that tree, which is the divine life of God Himself v. 9 . Before man received God into him as life, however, Satan came in. Man became fallen, dirty, and condemned by God, so he needed to be sprinkled, redeemed, forgiven, cleansed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled.
[21]  WHAT WE RECEIVE BY REGENERATION The Triune God Dwelling in Us
[22]  First John 4:13 says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."
[23]  The Law of Life with the Power of Life
[24]  Because we have the divine life and nature, out from this life with this nature we have the inner law of life.
[25]  After we are regenerated, we become the new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .
[26]  Then we will know that the central point of God's salvation and His eternal purpose is that God is working Himself in His Trinity into us as everything to make us parts of His dwelling place and the members of the Body of Christ, and we will also grow into this stature.
[27]  The New Testament clearly teaches and deals with our need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord after we are saved.
[28]  In some places we have spent one or two years, week after week and message after message, stressing that all the believers, the saved ones, need to consecrate themselves, not merely in a doctrinal way but in a very practical way.
[29]  If we read this chapter carefully, however, we will see that the chief point is not only realizing our crucifixion with Christ but that we must offer ourselves, not only consecrating ourselves as a whole but offering our members.
[30]  If we realize that we have been crucified with Christ and that we are released from sin, we must cooperate with the work the Lord has done by offering our members to Him.
[31]  ENTERING BY THE GATE OF CONSECRATION AND WALKING ON THE WAY OF CONSECRATION
[32]  It is entirely right that for any kind of experience we need to consecrate ourselves.
[33]  Consecration is like the entrance to a building; if we do not pass through the entrance, it is impossible to go anywhere in the building.
[34]  We may have consecrated ourselves to the Lord after we were regenerated, but the problem is whether or not we have continued in our consecration.
[35]  We may come to the meetings, fellowship with the saints, and do many things in the Christian life, but we may not be on the proper way.
[36]  If we do this, we advance by one step, but if we do not let the Lord have the victory, we are not on the way, regardless of how many things we do.
[37]  If we have a struggle with the Lord and we win the victory, making the Lord the defeated One, then regardless of how much we do for the Lord we will only waste our time.
[38]  In order to help someone in this way, we must pray for him to find one way or another to bring him through the crisis of consecration.
[39]  When we help people, we should not talk too much.
[40]  A second issue of a person's consecration is that he may have offered himself in a shallow way.
[41]  The best way to help him is to pray, not in a general way but by calling on the Lord as the highest authority to deal with this person.
[42]  CHAPTER FOUR THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-9; 2:27-28a; Acts 2:42 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING CONSECRATION
[43]  Many people say that consecration is for the purpose of being used by God to do a work for God.
[44]  If we come back to the Scriptures, we will find that consecration is actually for life, not for work.
[45]  After our consecration there are three basic matters of life that we need to know: the fellowship of life, the consciousness of life, and the law of life.
[46]  In theology, in terminology, and in teaching we may know life, but we will not know life in our experience, and we will not be on the line of life.
[47]  After we receive the eternal life in Christ, that is, Christ as our life, we need to pay attention to the fellowship of life.
[48]  The first two verses of 1 John 1 say, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us ."
[49]  THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE BEING THE FLOW OF LIFE WITHIN US
[50]  We know that life is Christ Himself, but for many years I considered what the fellowship of life might be.
[51]  I believe we now have the right words to describe and define the fellowship of life.
[52]  BEING IN THE LIGHT AND BEING CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[53]  First John 1:5 and 6 say, "And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[54]  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth."
[55]  If we are in the fellowship, we must be in the light, because the fellowship brings us into the presence of God who is light.
[56]  That is why if we are still in darkness but say we are in the fellowship, we are lying.
[57]  If we do not neglect the inner fellowship, in the light of God we will always realize and sense that we are dirty, sinful, wrong with something, and wrong with someone.
[58]  If we are truly in the light, we will have the real sense, the real realization, that we need the cleansing of the blood, because we are still in this old nature and we are still on this earth.
[59]  The more anointing we enjoy, the more life we have; the more life we have the stronger the fellowship we are in; the stronger the fellowship we are in, the more light we have; and the more light we have, the more cleansing of the blood we need.
[60]  This is the real flow of life, and the more flow of life we have, the more our problems are solved.
[61]  CHAPTER FIVE THE INNER SENSE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:17-24; Rom 8:6; John 8:12; Heb 8:10; Rom 8:2; 1 John 2:27-28a; Gal 2:20; Phil 2:13 CARING FOR THE INNER SENSE OF LIFE
[62]  Ephesians 4:17 through 24 speak concerning the consciousness of the inner life, the sense or feeling of life.
[63]  Verse 17 says, "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind."
[64]  Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[65]  If we have life, we have the sense; if we do not have life, we do not have the sense.
[66]  In our body we have the physical life, in our soul we have the psychological, soulish life, and now in our spirit we have the divine life, which is the life of God.
[67]  We need to know this inner sense in a full way.
[68]  THE INNER SENSE BEING THE REGULATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE
[69]  Second, we have the law of life in us Heb 8:10 .
[70]  When we are going to do something right, we may not sense the regulating, but when we are wrong, we sense it.
[71]  We may compare this to our stomach; if there is no trouble in our stomach, we do not sense our digestion, but when we are sick in our stomach, we sense it.
[72]  When we read the Bible, we do not have the sense we are right, but if we try to read novels or look at the pictures in the newspaper, we do not have peace.
[73]  THE ABOVE CRUCIAL MATTERS BEING THE MARK OF GOD'S ECONOMY
[74]  I hope you will do some homework to read the passages of Scriptures concerning the above five matters: the light of life, the law of life, the anointing of the Holy Spirit, Christ living in us, and God operating in us.
[75]  Even while you sleep, you may repeat, "The light of life, the law of life, the anointing, Christ lives in me, God operates in me."
[76]  The result of taking care of the inner sense is that we keep the fellowship with the Lord, we know the Lord in a living way, we grow in life, we are built up in the Body, and we have not merely outward power but the inner might in life.
[77]  From now on we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord for this: "Lord, now I know that I have the light of life, the law of life, the anointing of the Holy Spirit, Christ living in me, and God operating within me.
[78]  When we fellowship with God, we are in the light, and when we are in the light, we are full of the inner consciousness and we are clear in the inner sense.
[79]  CHAPTER SIX THE LAW OF LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 8:10-11
[80]  After we receive the Lord Jesus as our life, we have three main things: the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life.
[81]  In order to know the inner life, that is, to know and experience Christ as our life in a very practical way, we need to know these three related matters.
[82]  Hebrews 8:10 and 11 say, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them." Verse 10 is a quotation of Jeremiah 31:33, but in Jeremiah law is single in number, while in Hebrews it is not one law but laws.
[83]  The law of the Old Testament was the law of letters outside of the people of God.
[84]  THE INNER LAW BEING FOR REGULATION, AND THE ANOINTING BEING FOR GUIDANCE
[85]  In the New Testament there are two passages that tell us that there is no need for others to teach us.
[86]  After we are saved, we have an inner sense from the light of life, the law of life, the anointing of the Holy Spirit, Christ living within us, and God working and energizing within us.
[87]  It is when we take care of the law of life that we have harmony with the sense of life, and when we have harmony with the sense of life, we keep the fellowship with the Lord.
[88]  I still feel that we need to see something more clearly concerning the law of life.
[89]  Jeremiah 31:33a says, "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts."
[90]  GOD'S ECONOMY IN HIS DIVINE TRINITY BEING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US AS LIFE
[91]  God's economy, God's eternal purpose, and God's intention are to work Himself into us by being life to us.
[92]  In the same way, if we do not know the above matters in detail, we simply do not know the way to experience the inner life; we do not have the spiritual science of the inner life.
[93]  THE LAW BEING GOD HIMSELF LIVING AND WORKING WITHIN US
[94]  If God were a God of hatred and murder, we would have to live in the way of hatred and murder people day by day.
[95]  If, after we are saved, we cooperate with God by going along with the sense of life from the fellowship of life, day by day God's inscribing hand works on us to inscribe Himself into our mind, will, and emotion.
[96]  Too many real Christians are still wild in their thinking.
[97]  Their minds have never been refined and renewed because their minds have never been regulated by God's inscribing.
[98]  THE INSCRIBING OF THE INNER LAW BEING TRANSFORMATION INTO THE IMAGE OF GOD
[99]  Someone may say, "I praise the Lord I am saved.
[100]  If we are persons who truly cooperate with God, there is no other way but to love Him, and if we mean business to love Him, we will realize the flow within.
[101]  Today we do not need the law of Moses because we have the law of life within, and we do not need the ministry of the prophets because we have the inner anointing.
[102]  As we saw in the previous chapters, in order to be a proper, typical, normal Christian, walking in the spirit and following the Lord all the way, we must take care of the inner life.
[103]  I say again, these important matters concerning the Lord Himself, the indwelling Spirit, and the inner life have been very much neglected by today's Christianity.
[104]  If we do not know the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life, the inner life is merely a term to us; we do not know how to deal with the inner life.
[105]  It is hard to find a message in today's Christianity about the inner anointing.
[106]  We do have this term, and we do realize that Christ's name means the Anointed One, but the inner anointing has been almost entirely neglected.
[107]  Thirty-five years ago I also spoke in this way, but now I say that to speak of God's will in this way is not accurate.
[108]  The anointing that abides in us teaches us concerning all things.
[109]  THE PURPOSE OF THE ANOINTING BEING NOT OBEYING BUT ABIDING
[110]  Many Christians today neglect this matter, yet we do experience it day by day.
[111]  I must be faithful to say that many times I have not obeyed this painting, but praise the Lord, regardless of whether I obey or disobey, I am painted.
[112]  First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him."
[113]  One day the Lord spoke to me, "Child, I do not care whether you obey Me or disobey Me. I only care that after I anoint you, you will abide in Me." If I put paint on a brother, whether he takes my word or disobeys me, he still abides in the paint.
[114]  CHAPTER NINE DEALING WITH THE HEART Scripture Reading: Jer 31:33; Psa 51:6; Prov 4:23; Rom 10:10; Ezek.
[115]  The inner life is nothing other than the Lord Himself as life within us to be mingled with us.
[116]  God's way to make Himself one with us is to be life within us, so that we may take Him and experience Him as our life.
[117]  Concerning life, there are three necessary matters: the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life, which correspond with the three functions of the human spirit the fellowship, the intuition, and the conscience as the representative of the divine law.
[118]  THE MAIN PART RELATED TO THE INNER LIFE BEING THE HEART
[119]  The inward parts are not a concept we invented.
[120]  Without exception, God first comes to touch our mind.
[121]  We all have to learn that for God's dealing our mind must be as clear as possible.
[122]  We have the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life within, and we have the anointing of the Triune God within us.
[123]  This is good, but before we learn how to exercise our spirit, we must learn how to deal with our heart to be renewed in our mind, to have a loving emotion, to be right in our conscience, and to have a soft will.
[124]  If we deal with our mind, emotion, conscience, and will, we will have a proper heart, and it will be a useful entrance for God.
[125]  CHAPTER TEN DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 24:16; 1 Tim 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Tim 1:3; Rom 9:1; 2 Cor 1:12; Heb 13:18; Eph 4:19
[126]  In the previous chapter we saw a full sketch concerning the heart.
[127]  A Contrite Heart and a Contrite Spirit Being Related to the Conscience
[128]  Being Brought Back to the Rule of the Conscience
[129]  If we are fallen under human government, still needing others to govern us at school, at home, and in our city, we are fallen to the uttermost.
[130]  Nine Factors That Affect the Feeling of Our Conscience
[131]  The experience of all spiritual persons proves that the conscience is like the window to a building.
[132]  Our intention in knowing about our conscience is this: If we do not have a pure and good conscience, if there is an offense in our conscience, our Christian life is bankrupt, we cannot go on, and we are shipwrecked.
[133]  If we do not learn to deal with our conscience, we will not care, but if we do learn the lesson to deal with our conscience, it will give us the feeling to be more careful.
[134]  CHAPTER ELEVEN DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 24:16; 1 Cor 8:7; 1 John 1:9 A REVIEW OF THE POSITION OF THE CONSCIENCE
[135]  As we have seen previously, a human being is of three parts spirit, soul, and body.
[136]  In our spirit there are also three functions the conscience to know what is right and wrong and to justify or to condemn, the fellowship for us to commune with and contact God, and the intuition for us to sense the will of God directly.
[137]  Praise the Lord, the salvation of God came to bring us back from human government to the conscience, and if we enjoy more and more of God's salvation, then we are brought back even to God Himself through the conscience.
[138]  Whenever there is something wrong either with God, with man, or even with ourselves, our conscience condemns us.
[139]  We must differentiate between the condemnation of the conscience itself and the accusation of the enemy on the conscience.
[140]  If it is a fact that we have done something wrong, that we are wrong with God, with others, or with ourselves, our conscience will condemn us.
[141]  If even we ourselves cannot point out how we are wrong, yet we still have an accusation within us, we must conclude that it is something of the enemy and not take it.
[142]  We should not give a child of seven years the knowledge of a fifteen-year-old.
[143]  OUR SOUL WITH THE MIND NEEDING TO BE SAVED
[144]  Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
[145]  Moreover, His work on the sixth day was very good because on the sixth day God created man, and man in the eyes of God was very good v. 31 . On the second day, however, God did not say that His work was good, because His work on that day was to separate the waters below the expanse from the waters above the expanse, knowing that in the water there were the demons and in the air there were the evil spirits.
[146]  THE BATTLE BETWEEN SATAN AND GOD BEING IN OUR MIND
[147]  I hope I can make it clear that the battlefield within us between Satan and God is the mind.
[148]  Satan always likes to challenge us, to ask something, in order to get us into the snare of arguing, because the more we argue, the more we are in the mind, the more we are under the attack of the enemy, and the more God is gone.
[149]  I hope the Lord will make you clear that the mind is the battlefield and that we need to take the responsibility always to repent, to turn our mind to the Lord.
[150]  Even when we go to the department store, Satan will utilize many things to attract our mind.
[151]  Right away, then, we have to repent, to turn our mind to the Lord.
[152]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN CONTACTING THE LORD BY READING THE WORD AND PRAYING Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16a; John 6:63; Col 3:16; Eph 5:18-19; Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16a; John 5:39-40
[153]  Recently the brothers and sisters have been practicing a time of morning watch to learn how to contact the Lord by reading the word and praying.
[154]  If we keep the word only in our mind, we will not sing, but when we have the word as the Spirit filling us, we will spontaneously sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[155]  Matthew 4:4 says, "But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.'"
[156]  Because we have a body, we need physical food, but besides the body we also have a spirit, so we need spiritual food.
[157]  If we do not know how to eat the word, how can we enjoy it; how can we have the gladness and joy in our heart for the word and with the word?
[158]  Because the Bible is written in black and white, we have to read it.
[159]  TAKING THE COMMANDMENTS IN THE WORD AS THE LORD HIMSELF
[160]  I have been a Christian for more than forty years.
[161]  HAVING A TIME OF READING AND PRAYING IN THE MORNING
[162]  There is a real need, especially for the new and young believers who have not been built up in this way, to daily spend some time with the Lord, at least half an hour a day.
[163]  I would recommend that you have a morning time, but if that is not convenient, you can use other times.
[164]  CARING THE MOST FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT
[165]  In this message we have clearly seen that the word of God is the breath of God as food and drink to us.
[166]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN BEING BALANCED IN THE WORD AND PRAYER Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:15; 2:2; Col 3:16; 4:16; Psa 119:147-148
[167]  The verses in the Scripture Reading above show us how to deal with the word in a balanced way.
[168]  If we mean business with the Lord, if we seek Him, love Him, and desire to know Him, we need two ways to deal with His word, and we need two ways to pray.
[169]  If possible, we should buy Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible or Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible.
[170]  TWO WAYS TO PRAY Contacting the Lord to Breathe Him In
[171]  Rather, early in the morning we need to contact the Lord by breathing Him in. We read His word, understand something, and put it into prayer to digest what we read by prayer.
[172]  The central thought of God is that He desires to work Himself into us.
[173]  The only way for God to accomplish this is to be life to us.
[174]  By studying the whole Bible, we can realize that this tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as the Holy Spirit to be life to us in the form of food.
[175]  God created the earth and the heavens with billions of items so that man can exist on the earth in order to fulfill God's purpose.
[176]  It is that God wants to put Himself into man as his content and reality, so that man will become His expression.
[177]  LIFE AND THE FRUSTRATIONS TO LIFE IN THE PARABLES IN MATTHEW 13
[178]  Now we can understand the parables in Matthew 13.
[179]  The descriptive word in the third parable is mustard v. 31 . These are parables, figurative records that we must understand in a figurative way.
[180]  Since Christ has been sown into us as life, there has been a great struggle between the Lord and the enemy, both around us and within us.
[181]  To have the church is a matter not only of growth but of transformation.
[182]  The real situation, however, is that many meetings in different places drop the organization.
[183]  They do not like to have the organizing system, but after two or three years they become a vacuum.
[184]  Chapters one and two of 1 Corinthians speak concerning Christ as our portion and everything to us, but if we do not know how to experience Christ to such an extent, if we do not know how to sow Christ, grow in life, be built up, and build up others, those chapters are only doctrines to us.
[185]  CHRIST AS THE TREASURE HIDDEN WITHIN THE EARTHEN VESSEL
[186]  There is nothing miraculous about life, growth, and building to attract us.
[187]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE WAY TO GROW Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16; 1 Tim 1:14; John 21:15-17; 1 Cor 16:22-23
[188]  Ephesians 4:15 and 16 say, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love."
[189]  Therefore, we all must be very clear that God's intention is to put Christ as the seed of life into us in order to grow within us.
[190]  THE FIRST WAY TO GROW BEING TO LOVE THE LORD
[191]  There is no one passage that tells us all the things necessary for our growth.
[192]  If we practice these, then not only are we in life but we are on the way of growth, and we also will know how to help others to grow.
[193]  If we spend time to study these cases, we can see that the lack of growth is due to one thing: After a person is saved by the divine seed sown into him, he may not love the Lord.
[194]  If we do not have a love for the Lord, we are superficial; our heart is either stony or things other than the Lord Himself choke the seed in it.
[195]  It may be good that we pray for a few weeks, even when we come together for the prayer meeting: "Lord, show us this love, and grant us such a love."
[196]  If we do learn the lesson and we have this experience, then when we contact people, we will know where they are, and we will have an influence on them.
[197]  The second main item we must have is confession, or clearance.
[198]  After we begin to love the Lord, we must have a clear dealing with ourselves in order to have the real growth in life.
[199]  Perhaps at this time you do not feel that you are wrong in anything, but when you start to love the Lord, you will realize how wrong you are in many things, with people and with the Lord.
[200]  However, I can assure you that if we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we may know the entire Bible in a doctrinal way, but we will not have an inch of the growth in life.
[201]  We ourselves must learn how to discern the spirit and exercise the spirit.
[202]  I believe that we all know something about the discernment of the spirit, but we still do not know much.
[203]  If you would ask me what I learned from all these talks, I would have to testify that I learned only one thing: I did not exercise my spirit enough.
[204]  I can assure you that regardless of how many messages we have heard, how many books we have read, and how many times we have read the whole Bible, if we do not start to exercise our spirit, we will not have real growth.
[205]  We may know more Bible teachings and more of Christianity, and we may have a certain kind of increase and growth, but we do not have the growth in life until we know how to exercise our spirit.
[206]  We also must always stay in contact with the Lord.
[207]  Any time we are not in contact with the Lord, we are in degradation, not in growth.
[208]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE PROPER SPEECH FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Col 4:6; Matt 12:36; James 3:6, 8
[209]  We have a training in addition to the church meetings because in the past we learned that most believers who attend a church meeting only listen to the message and do not practice it.
[210]  In a similar way, if you do not speak one word, I do not know how much you have experienced and gained Christ and what the measure of the stature of Christ is within you, but if you speak for only five minutes, I will know.
[211]  We must learn to have our speech, word, and conversation with others full of Christ.
[212]  In order to apply the cross, we must also know the source of our speech.
[213]  Are we speaking from the Lord as the source through our spirit, or are we speaking something out of ourselves, out of the flesh or the self?
[214]  LEARNING THE LESSON OF SPEECH FOR THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE
[215]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE PRACTICE NEEDED FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 3:16-19; 2 Tim 2:22
[216]  Ephesians 3:16 to 19a says, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ."
[217]  Based on this word I would ask you, how much of Christ have you enjoyed today?
[218]  I would like to see that from now on, by the mercy and help of the Lord, the church will learn how to help the saints in a practical way to enjoy Christ, not only to know Christ, but to partake of Christ.
[219]  For instance, we can instruct the saints that Christ is the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit today; therefore, we must walk in our spirit and exercise our spirit to contact Christ and take Him as our life.
[220]  In order to put this into practice, we need to have the meetings.
[221]  The most profitable and proper way to meet is to fellowship with one another according to the instruction we have received.
[222]  Someone may ask a brother, "Do you realize that we have to exercise our spirit to contact Christ, walk in the spirit, and take Christ as our life in a practical way?"
[223]  The leading ones in the church should pay attention to those who improve, those among the brothers and sisters who have made some real progress.
[224]  Learning to Pray in a Living Way and Read the Word to Feed on the Lord
[225]  I exercise my heart and my spirit much to look to the Lord that from now on the church will go on in a very practical way to help the saints, not to gain more knowledge but to put all the instruction we have received into practice, to deal with all these things, not to criticize or condemn but to fellowship with one another, to help others, and to be willing to be helped.
