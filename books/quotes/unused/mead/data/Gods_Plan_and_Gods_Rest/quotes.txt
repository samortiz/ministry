[1]  Before God created man, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
[2]  Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
[3]  Not only does God desire that man should rule, but He marks out a specific area for man to rule.
[4]  Not only did God give man dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and the cattle, but He further required that man should rule over "all the earth."
[5]  Not only in His plan to create man was God's attention focused upon the earth, but after God made man, He clearly told him that he was to rule over the earth.
[6]  God desired, through man, to not allow Satan to intrude upon the earth, but the problem was that Satan was on earth and intended to do a work of destruction upon it.
[7]  Therefore, we must distinguish the difference between the work of saving souls and the work of God.
[8]  Many times the work of saving souls is not necessarily the work of God.
[9]  Saving souls solves the problem of man, but the work of God requires that man exercise authority to have dominion over all things created by Him.
[10]  God wanted to have man to rule for Him on this earth, but man did not attain to God's purpose.
[11]  If we were writing this psalm, perhaps we would add a parentheses at this point: "How pitiful that man has fallen and sinned and been cast out of the garden of Eden!
[12]  In God's view the earth can still be restored, the position given to man by God still exists, and His commitment to man to destroy the work of the devil still remains.
[13]  The last part of verse 9 says, "So that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything."
[14]  The birth of the Lord Jesus, the human living of the Lord Jesus, as well as the redemption of the Lord Jesus show us that His redemptive work is not only for man, but for all created things.
[15]  The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.
[16]  We are God's many sons, which will ultimately result in God bringing us into glory.
[17]  There was the eventful birth in Bethlehem because God ordained man to rule and restore the earth and because God determined that the creature man should destroy the creature Satan.
[18]  God desires to obtain a group of men who will do His work here on this earth, that God may rule on earth through man.
[19]  We must note the word "behold" in Genesis 1:31.
[20]  The word "rested" is the declaration that God was satisfied, that God delighted in what He had done; it proclaims that God's purpose was attained and His good pleasure was accomplished to the fullest.
[21]  Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good....And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
