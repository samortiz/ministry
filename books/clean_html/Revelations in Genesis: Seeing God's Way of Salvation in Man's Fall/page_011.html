<h2 class="head3">The Seed of the Serpent</h2>
<p>The third person spoken of in 3:15, <em>your seed,</em> refers to the seed of the serpent, the seed of Satan. In Matthew 3:7 John the Baptist said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?&rdquo; <em>Offspring of vipers</em> refers to the seed of vipers. The Lord Jesus said to the Jews, &ldquo;You are of your father the devil&rdquo; (John 8:44). The apostle John said, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil&rdquo; (1 John 3:8). These verses reveal that those who offend God, reject Him, and commit sins are full of the nature and wickedness of the devil. As such, they are the seed of the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>In the broadest sense, the fourth person in Genesis 3:15, <em>her seed,</em> the seed of the woman, refers to a group of strong overcomers. Although not all who have been redeemed and saved by grace are strong, there is a group who are not only saved but also strong; they are able to stand on God&rsquo;s side to deal with His enemy. The overcomers throughout the ages, such as Abel, Abraham, David, Daniel, and Isaiah, are faithful to God. They are not only God&rsquo;s redeemed but also the strong ones among God&rsquo;s people. They are the seed of the woman.</p>
<p>Moreover, the woman refers to the man-child in Revelation 12:5, which is the group of overcomers who are produced in the church. Revelation 12 presents a principle: the universal woman gives birth to a man-child, not a woman-child. This is significant. All God&rsquo;s people are female, but she gives birth to a man-child. The man-child symbolizes the strong overcomers. Before the man-child is born, he is inside the woman and is part of the woman. The man-child refers to those who are strong to overcome the world, Satan, and lusts and who are able to testify for God among His people. In the eyes of God, these ones are the seed of the woman. On the one hand, they are the seed of the woman; on the other hand, they are part of the woman.</p>
<p>The seed of the woman refers also to the Lord Jesus. Isaiah prophesied, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14), referring to the Lord Jesus. He is the seed of the woman, and He also bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head on the cross. Hence, the Lord Jesus is the true overcomer. He is the true seed of the woman.</p>
<p>The seed of the woman thus refers to the overcomers of God, who stand on God&rsquo;s side, who are strong and powerful, and who stand for God among His redeemed people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Four Crucial Points in the Promise</h2>
<h2 class="head3">There Being Enmity between the Serpent<br />
and the Woman</h2>
<p>Having identified the four persons referred to in the promise, we can understand the significance of Genesis 3:15 as God&rsquo;s first promise in the Bible. The first crucial point of the promise is that there would be &ldquo;enmity between you and the woman.&rdquo; <em>You</em> refers to the serpent who tempted, damaged, and deceived man. The serpent was the incarnation of Satan; hence, <em>you</em> refers to Satan. There will be enmity between Satan and the woman. This is the first aspect of the significance of God&rsquo;s promise. Spiritually speaking, this aspect refers to the enmity between Satan and those who have been redeemed by God throughout the ages.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being Enmity<br />
between the Seed of the Serpent<br />
and the Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>The second crucial point is that there would be enmity &ldquo;between your seed and her seed.&rdquo; Satan has a seed, which is great in number. There are two groups of people on the earth: one group is the seed of the devil, and the other is the seed of the woman. There is enmity between them.</p>
<p>There are also two aspects to this crucial point. First, throughout the ages all those who have followed Satan and are of Satan oppose and have had enmity toward the overcomers, who are of God. Those who do evil always have enmity against the overcomers of God, who rise up to testify for God. This enmity began in Genesis 4. Cain is the first type of the seed of Satan, because the New Testament clearly tells us that Cain was of the evil one (1 John 3:12). In contrast, Abel is the first type of the seed of the woman. Abel was not only the seed of the woman but in the principle of a man. He was a top one, a strong one, among the redeemed ones.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, starting with Abel, numerous people not only were redeemed to become part of the woman, but they also were part of the overcoming man-child. They stood firm in exceedingly great trials and temptations. They did not love their soul-life even unto death (Rev. 12:11). They did not care about persecution or being killed. They testified for God and stood on God&rsquo;s side, putting the enemy to shame. They were overcomers. Today we are saved, and we should also ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I a weak one in the woman or part of the man-child who stands in a strong way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, the enmity &ldquo;between your seed and her seed&rdquo; applies to the Lord Jesus even more. As soon as He was born, those who were of the devil wanted to kill Him (Matt. 2:13-16); eventually, they crucified the Lord on the cross (27:20-26).</p>
