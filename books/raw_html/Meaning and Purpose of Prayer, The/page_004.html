        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BEST PRAYER</h1>
<p>John 15:7 says, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo; This verse presents three crucial points. First, we must abide in the Lord. To abide in the Lord is to have fellowship with the Lord. Second, the Lord&rsquo;s words must abide in us. When we abide in the Lord and are in constant fellowship with Him, He speaks within us. Third, we ask the Lord according to our heart&rsquo;s desire. Such asking, or praying, comes from the Lord&rsquo;s speaking within us. If we are in fellowship with the Lord, He will speak within us. When the Lord speaks, we have the words with which to ask Him, that is, to pray to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO GOD AS A FRIEND</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Humbling Himself to Befriend Man</h2>
<p>The Bible says that Abraham was the friend of God. In Genesis 18 the God of heaven came to earth in order to befriend Abraham. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament say that Abraham was a friend of God (2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23). Our impression of God is that He is too great and that we are so low. Although we cannot describe His greatness in words, we can say that we are low to the uttermost. We were made from dust, became evil and corrupt by the fall, and were dead in our offenses and sins (Eph. 2:1). There is nothing that qualifies us to commune with God. Because of this fact, we have the natural and inaccurate concept that since God is so great and we are so low, it must not be easy to converse with Him, draw near to Him, pray to Him, or even cry out to Him.</p>
<p>Very few people have a thorough and accurate concept regarding prayer. Very few know that we can pray to God just as we speak with other human beings. Since most people have the concept that God is so great and man is so small, that God is high above and man is far below, they think that we must be solemn and reverent when coming to God. They also think that we must implore God for His care and mercy so that our requests may be granted and our desires fulfilled. This is the concept of most people, and I was not an exception.</p>
<p>When I was newly saved, I would always tidy myself up, lower my hands properly, walk slowly to a chair, kneel down sincerely, and respectfully bow my head before solemnly praying to God. Although nothing was wrong with this, it was a natural form of worship; it was prayer out of my natural feeling. Praying in this way is the result of not knowing God, misunderstanding Him, and not having divine revelation. God never intended for us to pray in this way.</p>
<p>New Testament believers are more blessed and more intimate with God than the Old Testament believers. However, even the forefathers in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, did not regard themselves as small human beings who had to prostrate themselves when they prayed and dared not lift up their faces to look at the great and high God sitting in the heavens. In Genesis 18 God wanted Abraham to pray to Him, so He came to be Abraham&rsquo;s friend. God did not lift Abraham up to the heavenly sanctuary of glory; instead, He humbled Himself and went to the lowly tent in which Abraham dwelt. God did not flaunt His prestige, majesty, or power. Abraham served cakes, a calf, curds, and milk, and God ate (vv. 1-8). God came to Abraham as an ordinary visitor. After He ate, the first thing He asked Abraham was, &ldquo;Where is Sarah your wife?&rdquo; (v. 9). Sarah did not come out but hid in the back. God said, &ldquo;I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and then Sarah your wife shall have a son&rdquo; (v. 10). When Sarah heard this, she laughed within herself, saying, &ldquo;After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&rdquo; (v. 12). God, knowing that Sarah laughed, asked Abraham, &ldquo;Why did Sarah laugh?&rdquo; (v. 13). Sarah denied it, saying, &ldquo;I did not laugh,&rdquo; but God said, &ldquo;No, but you did laugh&rdquo; (v. 15). This situation was altogether like that of a person visiting in a friend&rsquo;s home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Telling Man the Things on His Heart<br />
in Fellowship</h2>
<p>After God finished speaking, He rose up to leave, and Abraham walked with Him to send Him away (v. 16). Suppose a brother visits me in my home, and after our conversation he rises to leave, and I rise in order to walk with him. Although he walks out of the door, I do not want to leave him, so I walk farther with him until we reach the main street. This is how Abraham was with God. God rose to leave Abraham&rsquo;s tent, but Abraham walked with God in order to send Him off. It was in such a sending off that Abraham &ldquo;sent&rdquo; God&rsquo;s words out. We should not think that God has nothing to do or that He has nothing to say. God has many things to do and to say, but He needs us to walk with Him, to send Him off, so that He can tell us what He wants to do.</p>
<p>Many of us have had such an experience. Suppose Brother A is troubled in his heart concerning a matter and goes to seek help from Brother B. Even though Brother B receives him, Brother A may not be able to speak about what is on his heart, because it is not easy to talk about matters that trouble the heart. After talking for a while, Brother A may rise to leave even though he still has something on his heart. If Brother B bids Brother A farewell, then Brother A will keep the matter that is on his heart. If Brother B is very close to Brother A and sees that Brother A is still troubled about something, he will walk with Brother A, not wanting to leave him. Brother A may say, &ldquo;Please do not trouble yourself to walk any farther,&rdquo; but Brother B will say, &ldquo;I will walk just a few more steps.&rdquo; It is at this time that Brother A will feel comfortable to bring up what is on his heart. We often cannot immediately disclose the matters on our heart. It is not until we rise to leave and our friend sends us off that we can disclose the things on our heart.</p>
<p>God had two purposes for appearing to Abraham. One purpose was to tell Abraham that he would beget Isaac according to the time of life. This was related to Abraham. The other purpose was to tell Abraham that He would destroy Sodom. This was related to Abraham&rsquo;s nephew Lot. God told Abraham the matter that was related to him near his tent. God was to give Abraham a son. It was easy for God to tell Abraham this because it was something that God would do for Abraham. However, this was only part of God&rsquo;s purpose in visiting Abraham. It was not easy for God to tell Abraham the second purpose, for God had to find someone on the earth who would pray for Lot to be saved. This is what God wanted Abraham to do; hence, it was not easy for God to bring up this matter. Before God can do something in a brother, He must first find someone to pray for that brother. This is a major principle of God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Before God saves, edifies, or works in someone, He must find a person to pray for the things that He is about to do. Without our prayer, God cannot work. God visited Abraham so that Abraham would intercede for Lot to be saved. It is possible to say that God was asking Abraham to do something; hence, it was not easy for God to bring it up. It is easy to tell a person what we will do for him, but it is not easy to ask someone to do something for us. God wanted Abraham to do something, but in order to see if Abraham was willing, He did not bring it up quickly. If I want to ask a brother to help me, I would first talk with him to see how his heart is toward me. Only if he cares for me would I feel comfortable asking him to help me. This was the case when God spoke with Abraham. It was when Abraham walked with God to send God off and lingered in God&rsquo;s presence that God said, &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&rdquo; (v. 17). God spoke with Abraham as if He was speaking with a friend.</p>
<p>Here is an example. A brother&rsquo;s child was disobedient and often made his parents angry. One day this brother came to my home to fellowship with me. I asked, &ldquo;Brother, what is it that you want to fellowship about?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; and sipped his tea. He then talked about other matters and stood up to leave. It seemed that he wished to say something but found it difficult to bring up, so I walked with him to send him off. It was then that he said, &ldquo;It is not easy to raise children.&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;No, children are not easy to handle.&rdquo; He then said, &ldquo;My child has been in a lot of trouble at home for several days now.&rdquo; I then understood that he wanted me to help his child. When he walked into my home, he did not say, &ldquo;Brother, please come see my child.&rdquo; Rather, he told me what was on his heart after he saw that I cared for him like a close friend. I immediately asked, &ldquo;May I come see him tomorrow afternoon?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Nothing would be better.&rdquo; When I touched his heart, he told me what he wanted me to do.</p>
<p>God went to Abraham so that Abraham would pray for Lot. Genesis 19:29 says that when God destroyed Sodom, He remembered Abraham and rescued Lot. God&rsquo;s purpose was for Abraham to pray for Lot, but instead of being like a master commanding a servant, He was like a person needing a friend&rsquo;s help. God did not say, &ldquo;Abraham, I want to destroy Sodom; hence, you must pray for Lot.&rdquo; That would have been a master commanding his servant, not a conversation between close friends. Instead, God stood in front of Abraham that day as Abraham&rsquo;s friend. He and Abraham stood and talked as friends about the things on His heart. He said, &ldquo;The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, how great it is; and their sin, how very heavy it is! I shall go down and see whether they have done altogether according to its outcry&rdquo; (18:20-21). Abraham immediately understood that God wanted him to pray for Lot, who dwelt in Sodom. God seemed to be speaking in a riddle; it was as if He had said something yet said nothing. Abraham was very wise and did not say, &ldquo;God, Lot is still there; will You destroy him also?&rdquo; Neither God nor Abraham mentioned Lot&rsquo;s name, but Lot was their goal.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
