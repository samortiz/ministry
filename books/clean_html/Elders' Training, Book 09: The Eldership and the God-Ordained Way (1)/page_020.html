<P>God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15), and He waited four thousand years to fulfill this promise. About two thousand years after this promise to Adam, God promised Abraham that through his seed, all the nations of the earth would be blessed (22:18). The birth of Jesus was the fulfillment of these two promises. He was the Triune God incarnated. He came to fulfill His promise. Thus far, He has been waiting for almost two thousand years for the complete fulfillment of all of His words in the New Testament. To the Lord, however, a thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8).</P><P>Since the time of Martin Luther, the Lord has brought His people through many recoveries. According to my knowledge, the experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 may be one of the final things that needs to be recovered. Brother Nee stressed this so much, but he did not have the opportunity to see this come to pass. He shared his burden concerning the church meeting of mutuality first in 1937 and a second time in 1948. In the following year, 1949, mainland China was lost to the Communists. In 1952 he was put into prison by them, so there was no opportunity for him to see the Lord's recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26. I feel that I owe him something. Even for his sake, I need to labor to see this truth, which he stressed so much, realized among us.</P><P>I have been serving the Lord in His ministry for exactly fifty-five years. I began to practice the church life in my home in 1932. By 1984, fifty-two years later, I realized that I must do something for the Lord to see the churches brought into His ordained way. I have a burden to carry this out at any risk. I have not been attacked by the enemy at any time in my entire life as I have at this time, but by His mercy I am standing here. I only care for God's burden. Whether I could see His present burden come to pass or not, only He knows. I only care for one thing&#151;I have to finish my course; I have to discharge my burden.</P><P>The recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a great thing. I only care for this burden. If I could not speak to all the saints on this earth, at least I could speak to a part of them. I must discharge my burden. I desire to sacrifice everything for this burden, even my life. I do not care for my life. I only care for this burden. There is a Chinese proverb which says, "I will do it to the uttermost until I die." This is my feeling.</P><P>If we have the burden to take this way, we should simply do it ourselves. We should not criticize others or look down on others who do not take this way. On the other hand, those who do not feel to take this way should not criticize those who do. We all are saints in the Lord's recovery. From the very beginning of my fellowship concerning the new way, I did not expect all of the saints in the churches to pick up the burden to preach the gospel by visiting people. But if we mean business with the Lord, we must try our best to build up in the church a habit of going out to reach people, a habit of preaching the gospel by visiting people. I hope that all of the churches would endeavor to pick up this burden to build up such a habit. It would be wonderful if one-fourth of the saints could be raised up to carry out this burden. Then we will gain a consistent yearly increase.</P><P>We must help the saints to be revived. By 1984 my feeling was that all the churches had become somewhat dormant. We lost our impact and our morale. What we had by 1984 was a routine way to meet, a routine way to work, and a routine way to speak. We were practicing the church life in a routine way. Where was the living burden? Where was the burning among us? It was lost.</P><P>We need to pick up the burden to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, but I also advise all the churches not to do this in a fast way. I want to encourage us, though, to endeavor to enter into the reality of the Lord's biblical way. We must get ourselves revived to live a victorious life, and we need to help the saints to live the same life.</P><P>I hope that we could all be in one accord for the Lord's present move. We cannot organize the one accord. The one accord comes out of our spirit. We must endeavor to do everything we can to keep the one accord among us for the sake of the Lord's recovery. We should not do anything that would damage this one accord. We must be one with the church where we are according to what the church there feels it must practice presently. We must go on gradually and positively with the Lord until we fully enter into the reality of His ordained way.</P><P>I would again like to remind us that we must live a revived life. We must live a victorious life. We must learn to do things, not according to our preference but according to the spirit. In the spirit we love each other, sympathize with each other, and forgive each other. In this way the one accord can be produced and maintained among us.</P>
