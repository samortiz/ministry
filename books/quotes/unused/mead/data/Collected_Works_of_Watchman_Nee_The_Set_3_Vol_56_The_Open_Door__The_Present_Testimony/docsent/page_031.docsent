   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Doctrine of the Visible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Invisible Church Produced</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point a problem arose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church were state churches, they naturally contained many unsaved people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person cannot be saved by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a person could be saved by birth, we would only have to make Christianity the state religion of China and then all the Chinese would be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Becoming a Christian by regeneration would become unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being born is one thing, but being born again is quite another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result of such a practice, all the state churches were filled with unsaved people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank God, there were also many saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the unsaved people, in spite of their education and background, were still unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There then is a problem: Is the Anglican Church the church?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If it is the church, how could there be so many unsaved people in it?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this is quite strange!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this church there are quite a number of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consequently, a certain doctrine of the church emerged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to this doctrine, there are two kinds of churches: visible and invisible, that is, a church with a form and another church without a form.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this doctrine the church spoken of in the Scriptures was regarded as invisible and spiritual, but the church on the earth was regarded as visible and with a form.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the visible church there could be false Christians, but in the spiritual church everyone was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers, we must know that all doctrines have an origin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The doctrine of the spiritual church, that is, the doctrine of a visible and an invisible church, was brought in just as we have mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since man brought in so many false believers, the visible church, of course, became untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since all the British people fell into one net, there had to be both "good fish" and "bad fish."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Scriptures teach that the church is the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head of the church; thus, only believers can be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can there be unbelievers in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since so many unbelievers filled the church, what else could be done except to produce a doctrine about two kinds of churches, a visible one which is unreliable and an invisible one which is real?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was inevitable that this kind of doctrine would be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was essential to justify their existence; otherwise, it was impossible for them to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers, do you see the point?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is by necessity that this kind of doctrine was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The visible church became too loose; anything could be found in her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, such a doctrine was compelled to be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Supporters of this doctrine quoted the Scripture where it says that Satan sowed tares after the Lord sowed the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It says that we should not remove the tares, but "let both grow together" Matt 13:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These ones said that the invisible and spiritual church consists of those who are born again, among whom not one is false.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the visible church there are tares, which should not be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many brothers and sisters reading this passage thought that this was right, that there was a difference between the visible and the invisible church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They did not realize that such evil can never be covered up by the doctrine of the visible and invisible churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These ones made the church too inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus was speaking about the wheat and the tares growing together in the world Matt 13:38 , not in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the church was expanded to be as large as the world, naturally tares were included in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consequently, the only way to explain the church was to say that there is a church with form and a church without form.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is true that these ones acknowledged that the Anglican Church is too big.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is another church, the church in the Bible, which only consists of spiritual and regenerated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What was the condition of the churches on earth in Revelation 2 and 3?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is a golden lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a place where light shines forth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He was on earth, the Lord Jesus said, "Let your light shine before men."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the use if the light shines, but men cannot see it Matt 5:16 ?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Tonight, we can be here because there is visible light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What could we do if it were invisible?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An invisible light is a joke, a big joke.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can there be an invisible light?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, if light is visible, it must have a form; it cannot be without form.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A light without form is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church on the earth must be seen by men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible has no thought of the church being an invisible light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But today, the church is spoken of not in relation to putting a lamp under a bushel, but of shining forth invisible light from a lampstand!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word that the Lord Jesus spoke to us is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He said, "You are the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden" Matt 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is visible, not invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord wants us to be manifested on the earth and seen of men.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must see, therefore, that what is called the visible church is actually the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because some insist on calling it a church, they explain that there is another church within this outward church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, the church spoken of in God's Word is one that comes out of the world and is separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since this is so, we only can acknowledge the existence of a spiritual church, not an outward church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The problem today is that there are many brothers and sisters who think that the unity among Christians is a "spiritual" unity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>According to this spiritual unity, there are some people in the church who are spiritual and some who are not.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, in every church there is an outward aspect and a spiritual aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With spiritual unity, a group of spiritual brothers can have fellowship with another group of spiritual brothers, and they can all be one with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I want to point out that the reason there is a need for this kind of spiritual unity is that there are some who are of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If everyone is brought forth by the word of God, the question of spiritual unity would never need to arise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This matter is very important because it touches a basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you ask someone how many are unsaved in his denomination, he would probably say about half of them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Several denominations may tell you that they would be very happy if one in ten is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These denominations are not much different from the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They are like an onion which has many layers that can be peeled off.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What they mean is that the nine outside layers mean nothing; only the center counts.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Undoubtedly, the principle of the denominations is still the principle of the state church because many in their midst do not belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For this reason their fellowship must, by necessity, be limited to spiritual ones, not to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If the whole church were to fellowship together, many unbelievers would be involved.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In order to have spiritual fellowship, the whole church cannot be included.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But the Bible includes the whole church as the boundary of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because the condition of the church is murky and the boundary of the church is ill-defined, there is the need of "spiritual" fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today many kinds of peculiar churches exist in the world because many non-Christians were brought into them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since many unbelievers and false Christians are in the "church," Christians in these churches have to maintain an invisible fellowship; all their fellowship is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They say that they have fellowship of the heart, that their hearts are joined to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Let me say this: The very need for this kind of fellowship is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must understand and see through this.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This need for "spiritual" unity exists only because the position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we stand in the right position, we are already one.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the church is proper, the invisible would become visible, and there would be no need for invisible fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord said that the church is a lampstand, but they say that the light it sheds is only an invisible light.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is strange.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This kind of spiritual fellowship and spiritual unity was produced by mixing unbelievers in the church.</S>
