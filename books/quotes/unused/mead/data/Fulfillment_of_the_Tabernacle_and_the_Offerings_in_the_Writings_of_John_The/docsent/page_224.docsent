   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S TRAINING OF HIS DISCIPLES To Experience His Invisible Presence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The disciples did not realize that the Lord Jesus had not left them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the time that He breathed Himself into them, He remained in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no record in chapter twenty of the Lord's leaving the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Lord was in the disciples, when they went fishing, He went with them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning this, it is significant that 21:1 tells us, "Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that this verse does not say that the Lord Jesus came to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It says that He manifested Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The disciples spent the whole night fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Possibly they began in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord did not appear to them until morning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that He was silent and hid Himself as they spent the entire night trying to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 4 says, "Now as the morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord manifested Himself to them again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not think, however, that the Lord was away from them during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, He went fishing with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, they brought the Lord to the sea of Tiberias, for He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Lord dwelt in them and went with them wherever they went, they did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Lord's main purpose in this chapter was to train His disciples to realize His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The disciples had enjoyed the Lord's visible presence for three and a half years and were accustomed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then suddenly the Lord changed His way of being with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now He was the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord was in the flesh, He was visibly present with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in resurrection He became the invisible pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This pneuma is real, but it is not visible to human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to train the disciples to experience and enjoy His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not want them to think that He had left them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wanted them to realize that He would always be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the reason the Lord took forty days, from the day of resurrection until the day of His ascension, to train the disciples to realize His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible the number forty signifies a period of testing or training.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During this period of forty days the Lord trained His disciples to appreciate His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the Lord's invisible presence is more precious and prevailing than His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the basic lesson the Lord was teaching the disciples in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To Trust in Him for Their Living</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus manifested Himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, His word exposed the reason they went fishing: "Little children, do you have any fish to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They answered Him, No" v. 5 . Here we see that the disciples went fishing because they had nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They came to the sea of Tiberias expecting to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they labored the whole night and caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They cast therefore, and they were not able to haul it in, because of the abundance of fishes."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see that the Lord was training His disciples to trust in Him for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "You don't need to go fishing in order to have something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I will feed you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Simply stay with Me, and I will take care of your living."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of the saints may say, "Brother Lee, we agree with you concerning what you minister about spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when you tell us that the Lord Jesus will feed us, that He will take care of the practical matters of our daily living, we need to consider further.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I'm not sure that the Lord Jesus will really feed me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Maybe I should go back to my old profession."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regarding this, I do not care to argue with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would simply point out that according to history the Lord always feeds His people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, you need to work at a job.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is your duty, your responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But you need to realize that the environment is not under your control.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, the environment is in the Lord's hands and under His control.</S>
