<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="6">	<li>The ascension of the consummated Christ as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God brought Him from the earth into the heavenly sphere, where He was enthroned to be appointed as so many items of His status for His qualification to carry out, in His heavenly ministry, what He has consummated in His earthly ministry:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the God-appointed Redeemer to apply His redemption to the repentant sinners—Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained Ruler of the kings of the earth and the Savior to execute His full salvation in life to the believers for their regeneration—Rev. 1:5; Acts 5:31.</li>		<li>As the God-established Minister to minister all His unsearchable riches with heaven to His believers for their growth in life—Heb. 8:2.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained Mediator of the new covenant to execute what He has accomplished in the new covenant to the believers—Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained surety of the new covenant to guarantee the sure fulfillment of the new covenant to the believers—Heb. 7:22.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained High Priest to take care of the believers as God’s people in His loving sympathy and intercession for them that they may be saved to the uttermost—Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25.</li>		<li>As the God-established good Shepherd to shepherd God’s people as His flock throughout their Christian life on this earth—John 10:11, 14, 16; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ first poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers as the Spirit of power for the producing and formation of the churches—Acts 2:1-2.</li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body sent out the apostles and disciples to preach the gospel and establish the churches.</li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body builds up His Body by the transforming Spirit through the gifted ones among the believers:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ is to have the consummated Triune God wrought into the believers that they may become a people of God who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their regenerated spirits.</li>		<li>The consummation of the heavenly ministry of Christ is to build the believers, who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God, into His organic Body through the churches, which are composed of the believers, who have the organic union with the Triune God. This building up of the Body of Christ produces the overcomers whom Christ will marry, and they as the bride of Christ will become the army of Christ for Christ to carry out His upcoming kingdom ministry. This building up of the Body of Christ also consummates the ultimate consummation of God’s eternal economy—the New Jerusalem as God’s expansion and expression in eternity.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
