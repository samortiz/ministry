[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE ONE INTRODUCTION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:1-9
[2]  The arrangement of the books of the Bible is truly sovereign of the Lord.
[3]  For example, Revelation is not the first book, and Genesis is not the last.
[4]  Even this one example proves that the arrangement of the books of the Bible is according to God s sovereignty.
[5]  I. THE WRITERS AND THE RECEIVERS A. The Writers 1.
[6]  In this message we shall consider further Paul s introductory word in 1:1-9.
[7]  Verse 2 says, To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints.
[8]  According to grammar, to the church of God is in apposition to to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.
[9]  This indicates that to the church of God equals to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.
[10]  In verse 2 Paul also says, With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.
[11]  In verse 3 we have Paul s greeting to the Corinthians: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[12]  Grace is God as our enjoyment John 1:17; 1 Cor 15:10 , and peace is a condition which results from grace, issuing from the enjoyment of God our Father.
[13]  In 1:6 Paul says, Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you.
[14]  The testimony of Christ here is different from the testimony of Jesus in Revelation 1.
[15]  Paul s preaching of Christ was a testimony of Christ.
[16]  This word is a continuation of verse 8, strengthening the thought with the assurance of God s faithfulness.
[17]  God has called us into such a fellowship that we may partake of Christ, participate in Him, and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.
[18]  In the first message of this Life-study we pointed out that, after presenting a wonderful sketch of the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life in Romans, Paul gives us an illustration in 1 Corinthians of the actual Christian life, church life, and Body life.
[19]  However, we should not understand this to mean that what we have in 1 Corinthians is an illustration of the proper or normal Christian life, church life, and Body life.
[20]  Perhaps you are wondering how we can enjoy this fellowship.
[21]  We can enjoy it simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.
[22]  However, if we say that we are of Paul, we are actually calling on the name of Paul.
[23]  Every name other than the name of Christ must be set aside, and we must exalt only one name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the name of the wonderful One into whose fellowship God has called us.
[24]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIVE CHRIST AND HIS CROSS,
[25]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that Christ and His cross are the unique solution to all problems in the church.
[26]  Colossians 1:12 says, Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.
[27]  All Christians know that God has redeemed us, but not many realize that He has also qualified us to partake of Christ as the portion of the saints.
[28]  In 3:11 Paul says, For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[29]  In 15:45 Paul says that as the last Adam Christ became a life-giving Spirit.
[30]  If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not be power and wisdom to us.
[31]  Those who claim that it is heretical to teach that Christ is the Spirit have no way to experience Christ.
[32]  As we have pointed out, the way to enjoy this fellowship is to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.
[33]  Again I say, we have been called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIX CHRIST NOT DIVIDED Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:10-17
[35]  In 1:10 Paul says, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
[36]  From this verse the apostle begins to deal with the divisions among the Corinthians.
[37]  First, he beseeches them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names Phil 2:9 and should be the unique name among all His believers.
[38]  However, by ranking the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, the divisive Corinthians made the same kind of mistake Peter made on the mount of transfiguration when he ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ Matt 17:1-8 .
[39]  When Paul speaks of the same thing, he means Christ and Him crucified.
[40]  Thus, for us to speak the same thing means that we all speak concerning Christ and Christ crucified.
[41]  From experience I can testify that, although according to history it is impossible for Chinese and Japanese, Germans and French, to be truly one, I have seen real oneness among the believers from these different nationalities.
[42]  Whether or not a local church is a genuine church is not a matter of condition.
[43]  If we see the church in the Lord s recovery in this way and care only for Christ as our unique center, we shall not have any divisions.
[44]  If we would be attuned in the same opinion, we need to have a vision of the place of Christ in God s economy.
[45]  I am burdened that all the saints would see Christ and know Him.
[46]  When you have seen the all-inclusive Christ and have learned the secret of enjoying Him, your way of thinking and speaking will be changed.
[47]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVEN CHRIST CRUCIFIED,
[48]  Brother Watchman Nee once told us that what is most important and precious in reading the Bible is to touch the spirit of the writer.
[49]  When Paul wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, no doubt there was a specific burden in his spirit.
[50]  The first two chapters of 1 Corinthians are very difficult to understand.
[51]  You may read these chapters again and again without understanding what Paul is talking about.
[52]  You may be impressed by many different verses and yet not be able to see Paul s main point.
[53]  The main point in these chapters is that in his spirit Paul was endeavoring to bring the distracted philosophical believers back to Christ.
[54]  For this reason, in these chapters Paul does not emphasize the resurrected Christ or the ascended Christ; instead, he emphasizes the crucified Christ.
[55]  Verse 18 says, For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
[56]  In verse 17 Paul declares, For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in wisdom of speech, that the cross of Christ should not be made void.
[57]  The cross of Christ is the center in the accomplishment of God s New Testament economy, which is to have a church produced through the redemption of Christ.
[58]  Paul preached Christ crucified v. 23; 2:2; Gal 3:1 and boasted in the cross of Christ Gal 6:14 , not the law with circumcision, which the Jews and some of the Jewish believers fought for Gal 3:11; 5:11; 6:12-13 , nor the philosophy which was promoted by the Greeks and some of the Gentile believers Col 2:8, 20 . The cross of Christ abolished the ordinances of the law Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 , and we the believers have died to philosophy, an element of the world Col 2:20 . But Satan instigated the Judaizers and philosophers to preach their isms of worldly wisdom that the cross of Christ might be made void.
[59]  In verse 19 Paul continues, For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I will set aside.
[60]  Once again Paul introduces this verse with the word for, showing that it also is an explanation of what has gone before.
[61]  Here Paul points out that God does not care for the wisdom of the wise or the understanding of the prudent.
[62]  Verse 22 says, Since Jews indeed ask for signs and Greeks seek wisdom.
[63]  A sign is a miraculous token Matt 12:38-39 to substantiate what is preached.
[64]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE EIGHT CHRIST CRUCIFIED,
[65]  As believers in Christ, we all must be able to answer this question: Why was it necessary for Christ to be crucified?
[66]  In order to accomplish anything, we need both power and wisdom.
[67]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINE CHRIST, OUR WISDOM:
[68]  Paul opens verse 30 with the words, But of Him you are in Christ Jesus.
[69]  It is God who put us in Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ.
[70]  God has transferred us out of Adam into Christ 2 Cor 5:17 through Christ s crucifixion and resurrection Gal 2:20 and by our believing and being baptized John 3:15; Gal 3:26-28 .
[71]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TEN FOUR CRUCIAL MATTERS
[72]  FOR THE PARTICIPATION IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9; 6:17; 10:16
[73]  In this message we shall consider four crucial matters covered in the first ten chapters of 1 Corinthians.
[74]  In 1:2 Paul says, To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.
[75]  In dealing with the problems in the church at Corinth, Paul includes the verses we quoted at the beginning of this message.
[76]  Even 1:2 is an aspect of Paul s handling of the problems.
[77]  Let us now put these four matters together and see what kind of picture they present.
[78]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN PARTICIPATION IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9-13
[79]  In 1 Corinthians chapters one, two, and three Paul uses a number of special terms and extraordinary expressions.
[80]  These terms and expressions are not found elsewhere in Paul s writings.
[81]  Long after God accomplished the work of creation, the first step toward the dispensing of Himself into us, God took the second step incarnation.
[82]  One day, the infinite God, the very God who created the universe, became a man.
[83]  The meaning of the word fellowship is deep and profound.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWELVE PARTAKING OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9; 6:17; 10:16-17 IN RESURRECTION
[85]  He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[86]  As God incarnate, He lived as a man on earth for thirty-three and a half years.
[87]  We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ is our portion and that we have been called into the fellowship of this Christ.
[88]  But how can the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ become our portion for our enjoyment?
[89]  In this verse Paul declares, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
[90]  In 10:16 Paul comes to another important point: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
[91]  The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ?
[92]  First Corinthians 1:9 speaks of the fellowship of the Son, but 10:16 speaks of the fellowship of the body and blood of Christ.
[93]  The fellowship in 10:16 is more practical than that in 1:9, for in 10:16 Christ s blood is separate from His body, indicating that it is possible for us to feast on Him.
[94]  However, in 1:9 Christ as the Son of God is not yet ready for us to partake of by eating Him.
[95]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS WISDOM
[96]  Why does Paul, after pointing out that Christ is theirs and ours and that we have been called into His fellowship, say that this very Christ has become wisdom to us from God, both righteousness, sanctification, and redemption?
[97]  Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the materials used in the construction of the freeway in our Christian life.
[98]  Have you ever realized that wisdom is our way, our freeway, and that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the materials used in making this freeway?
[99]  When we enjoy Christ, the first aspect of the divine virtue, the divine goodness, we shall experience is God as our righteousness.
[100]  Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we first have God as our righteousness.
[101]  We have pointed out that the more we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord, the more righteous we become.
[102]  Now we need to see that not only do we become righteous and holy, but we are also sanctified.
[103]  This means that the more we exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we are separated from what is common and from being common ourselves.
[104]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF CHRIST
[105]  ISSUING IN THE EXPERIENCE OF HIM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:9-12, 23-24, 30
[106]  If we read 1 Corinthians only in a superficial way, we may think that it is a book which deals merely with outward matters.
[107]  First Corinthians is rich in Christ, the Spirit, the church, and life.
[108]  In 1:23 and 24 Paul says, But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God s power and God s wisdom.
[109]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN CHRIST CRUCIFIED,
[110]  THE FOCUS OF THE APOSTLE S MINISTRY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:1-5; Col 2:2, 9; Eph 1:9-10
[111]  According to these verses, Christ crucified was the focus of Paul s ministry.
[112]  In verse 2 Paul continues, For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.
[113]  The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle s ministry.
[114]  For this he determined not to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ when he was about to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks.
[115]  In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
[116]  Weakness here refers to the apostle s physical weakness due perhaps to his physical sufferings in the persecutions he endured for the gospel.
[117]  Paul did not display himself as a physically strong man among the Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in their philosophies, but also physically in their gymnastics.
[118]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN GOD S WISDOM IN A MYSTERY,
[119]  The more we consider 2:6-10, the more we realize that these verses are deep, profound, and difficult to understand.
[120]  To understand them we need to consider the context of chapters one and two, chapters which give us a clear view of Christ as God s center and our portion.
[121]  According to Paul s understanding in chapters one and two, real wisdom is the mysterious wisdom hidden in God.
[122]  As we have pointed out, this wisdom is Christ Himself.
[123]  God has made this mysterious, hidden wisdom to be our destiny.
[124]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN COMMUNICATING SPIRITUAL THINGS
[125]  BY SPIRITUAL WORDS TO SPIRITUAL MEN Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:11-16, 7, 10 LIVING CHRIST FOR THE EXPRESSION OF GOD
[126]  In order to accomplish this, God desires to come into man to be his life so that man may live Him out.
[127]  Most of those believers who are baptized into a particular denomination are shaped, not according to Christ or the Bible, but according to that denomination.
[128]  They speak and behave according to that particular denomination.
[129]  Now that we are in the church life in the Lord s recovery, we should not be shaped by something other than Christ.
[130]  Referring to the things given to us by God, Paul goes on to say in verse 13, Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things.
[131]  The Greek word rendered communicating literally means mixing or putting together, as interpreting or expounding.
[132]  Verse 14 says, But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
[133]  Verse 13 stresses the spiritual means, that is, the spiritual words by which the spiritual things are spoken.
[134]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE TWO SPIRITS IN KNOWING CHRIST
[135]  AS THE DEPTHS OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:2, 7-16
[136]  In 2:1 Paul says, And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not with excellence of speech or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.
[137]  Paul did not come to Corinth to display excellent speech or philosophical wisdom in proclaiming the testimony of God.
[138]  Paul speaks of these things in verse 9: But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.
[139]  Although eye has not seen them and ear has not heard them and although they have never arisen in man s heart, God has revealed them to us v. 10 , and freely given them to us v. 12 . Day by day, we see something further and deeper regarding Christ as our portion.
[140]  Furthermore, from experience we know that whenever we enjoy Christ, Christ becomes God s joy to us.
[141]  But when we do not experience Christ, God is not happy with us, and we do not have the joy of God.
[142]  When we exercise our spirit to know the things of man, we are ushered into the Spirit of God.
[143]  The two spirits, the regenerated human spirit and the divine Spirit, cannot be separated.
[144]  This is the reason Paul speaks of both spirits in 2:11.
[145]  Then he goes on to say that the things of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
[146]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE SPIRIT OF MAN
[147]  In the past I have said that we may liken the Bible as a whole to a person s hand, the New Testament to a ring on the hand, and the book of Romans to a diamond on the ring.
[148]  How lovable and precious is Paul s Epistle to the Romans!
[149]  In principle, both the things of man and the things of God mentioned in 2:11 should refer to matters Paul has spoken of in the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians.
[150]  This is the proper way to understand not only the Bible, but also any kind of writing.
[151]  Suppose your father writes you a long letter in which he speaks about many things.
[152]  In verses 17 through 25 Paul comes to the things of God.
[153]  In 1:18 he mentions the word of the cross.
[154]  The word of the cross is one of the things of God.
[155]  In verse 21 Paul says, For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.
[156]  Many believers do not have an adequate understanding of the Spirit of God.
[157]  In many cases they are even afraid of talking about the Spirit.
[158]  If we did not have the ministry of Paul, we would not know God s eternal purpose or His economy.
[159]  Although Peter was a leading apostle, he does not tell us anything about the Body of Christ.
[160]  The highest word in Peter s writings concerns the partaking of the divine nature: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .
[161]  In Paul s writings many terms are used to show that Christ is all-inclusive and extensive, that He is the life-giving Spirit, that He is everything in God s economy and everything to us.
[162]  In his Epistles Paul also reveals that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the dwelling place of Christ, the bride of Christ, and even the new man.
[163]  Furthermore, in his ministry Paul tells us that we are in Christ, that Christ is in us, and that we are joined to Christ as one spirit.
[164]  This is the vision that Christ, the ultimate expression of God, has become the life-giving Spirit so that He may impart Himself into us as our life to make us living members of His Body to express Him organically.
[165]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE SPIRIT OF MAN
[166]  In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.
[167]  Here the Lord says that the Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Lord and make Their abode with him.
[168]  Second, it is also emphasized that, after His ascension, Christ sent the Holy Spirit of God upon the church.
[169]  In chapter three of 1 Corinthians Paul comes to the church.
[170]  Although the word church cannot be found in this chapter, what Paul covers here is very much related to the church.
[171]  Paul composed this chapter in a very wise way.
[172]  We become members of the church not by the way of joining a social organization, but by being planted.
[173]  Paul planted the believers at Corinth into the church, which is God s farm, so that they might grow Christ.
[174]  In verse 6 Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.
[175]  However, we should not think that only those such as Paul and Apollos are responsible for planting and watering.
[176]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE CHURCH, GOD S FARM AND GOD S BUILDING 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:5-17 TWO ASPECTS OF PLANTING
[177]  In 3:6 and 7 Paul speaks of planting and watering: I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.
[178]  To plant is to minister life and impart life to someone who is spiritually dead so that this person may become living.
[179]  When life is imparted to a person dead in sins, he becomes a living plant.
[180]  Because Paul imparted life to the Corinthians, he was their father in Christ.
[181]  In 4:15 he says, For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
[182]  As we grow on the farm, we produce precious materials for the building of God s habitation on earth.
[183]  God s eternal goal is the building, the temple built with precious materials on Christ as the unique foundation.
[184]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR GROWTH IN LIFE NEEDED 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:1-9
[185]  Paul s underlying thought in chapters one and two is that Christ is God s unique center and also the portion of the saints.
[186]  Beginning with chapter three, Paul speaks regarding the church.
[187]  When he comes to the church, he writes in a very meaningful, profitable, and life-giving way, in the way of feeding, planting, and watering for growth.
[188]  In 3:1-9 we see that Paul regarded all the believers in Christ as plants which need growth.
[189]  The most necessary thing for a plant is growth.
[190]  The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life the eternal life and the Holy Spirit but they were desperately short in the growth in life.
[191]  Once again I wish to point out that when we read or study the Bible, we need to get into the spirit of the writer.
[192]  In 1 Corinthians 3 the burden in Paul s spirit was to help the believers at Corinth realize what they had and what they needed.
[193]  They had the divine life and the Holy Spirit, and they needed growth growth in life and growth in the Holy Spirit.
[194]  In 3:1 Paul tells the believers at Corinth, And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[195]  The fact that Paul refers to them as infants indicates that they had not grown in life after receiving the initial gifts of the divine life and the Holy Spirit.
[196]  If the saints in a particular locality are short of the growth of life, they cannot have the proper church life.
[197]  We know from Paul s word in 3:1 that the Corinthian believers had not grown in life, but remained in the stage of infancy.
[198]  Thus, the church is the farm to produce materials so that God may fulfill His goal to have the building.
[199]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE BUILDING WORK
[200]  WITH TRANSFORMED MATERIALS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-14
[201]  In this message we shall consider from 3:10-14 the subject of the building work with transformed materials.
[202]  In verse 10 Paul says, But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.
[203]  B. Gold Signifying the Nature of God the Father
[204]  What does it mean in a practical way to build with gold?
[205]  The precious stones are the totality of gold and silver.
[206]  When in our spiritual experience we have the nature of God and the redemptive work of Christ, the result will be the transformation of the Holy Spirit.
[207]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE BUILDING WORK WITH NATURAL THINGS
[208]  In the foregoing message we considered the building work with transformed materials.
[209]  This is the positive side of Paul s word about the building work.
[210]  Specifically and practically, wood here refers to the human nature of the Greeks.
[211]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-15
[212]  In 3:10 Paul urges us to take heed how we build upon Christ as the unique foundation.
[213]  The believers in Corinth were not to build with their Greek culture, philosophy, or makeup.
[214]  To build in that way is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, not with gold, silver, and precious stones.
[215]  In 3:13-15 Paul says, The work of each shall become manifest; for the day shall make it known, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will test each one s work, of what sort it is.
[216]  If anyone s work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward.
[217]  If anyone s work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire.
[218]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE FEEDING, DRINKING, EATING, PLANTING,
[219]  WATERING, AND GROWING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:1-9
[220]  In chapter three of 1 Corinthians there are many precious things and many unusual expressions.
[221]  Have you been feeding others in the church life?
[222]  In order to feed others, we must first be fed ourselves.
[223]  The church is a place not primarily for teaching, but for feeding.
[224]  As believers, we should also be those who plant and water.
[225]  From reading verses 6 and 7, we may get the impression that only certain ones like Paul and Apollos can plant and water.
[226]  But we should not think that only the leading ones or those who share in the ministry of the Word can do the planting and the watering.
[227]  Paul could say that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth because the believers are God s farm.
[228]  We need to understand Paul s word about Christ as the foundation according to the context of the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians.
[229]  In these chapters Paul seems to be saying, When you Corinthians declare that you are of Apollos, Cephas, or Paul, you are laying another foundation.
[230]  Whenever you say that you are of someone or something, you are laying a foundation.
[231]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-17; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2
[232]  In verses 10 and 11 Paul speaks directly and explicitly concerning Christ as the foundation: According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.
[233]  In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says, But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit lit.
[234]  . In order to behold the Lord and be transformed, we need an unveiled face.
[235]  There should not be a veil between us and the Lord.
[236]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO BUILDING OR DESTROYING THE TEMPLE OF GOD?
[237]  Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-23; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2 GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES
[238]  Referring to Christ as the unique foundation, Paul says in 3:10, But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.
[239]  In verse 12 he goes on to say, But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.
[240]  Transformation involves the Spirit s working both inwardly and outwardly.
[241]  The Spirit works outwardly in our circumstances for the sake of His inward working.
[242]  For example, the Spirit may use our children to help transform us.
[243]  In 3:16 and 17 Paul says, Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[244]  Here Paul warns us not to destroy God s temple.
[245]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE ALL THINGS FOR THE CHURCH
[246]  From reading 3:18-23 we realize that chapter three is an explanation and continuation of chapters one and two.
[247]  In the first two chapters of this book, Paul deals with the wisdom of the Corinthians.
[248]  In 3:18 Paul refers to those who think themselves to be wise, and in verse 19 he says that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
[249]  To boast in spiritual giants is also to destroy the temple of God, the church.
[250]  In verses 21 and 22 Paul says, All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.
[251]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR STEWARDS OF THE MYSTERIES OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:1-9
[252]  The focus of this chapter is neither Christ nor the church; it is the stewards of God s mysteries.
[253]  The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God s mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ Col 2:2; Eph 3:4 , to the believers.
[254]  In 4:1 Paul says, In this way let a man account of us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
[255]  By this way Paul means the way described in 3:21-23.
[256]  In these verses Paul charges us not to boast in men, for all things are ours, we are Christ s, and Christ is God s.
[257]  In this way, Paul says, he was to be accounted as a servant of Christ.
[258]  First Corinthians 4:6 says, Now these things, brothers, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to go beyond what has been written, that no one be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other.
[259]  By these things Paul refers to the things mentioned in the preceding passage, from chapter one to this chapter.
[260]  In 4:9 Paul says, For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
[261]  It is significant that here Paul says I think.
[262]  After pointing out that the apostles have become a spectacle to the world, Paul goes on to say in verse 10, We are fools because of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonored.
[263]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX DEALING WITH AN EVIL BROTHER Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 5:1-13
[264]  In 5:1-13 Paul turns to the matter of dealing with an evil brother.
[265]  The first problem, dealt with in chapters one through four, is the matter of division, which is mainly related to the natural life of the soul.
[266]  The second problem, dealt with in chapter five, the second section of the book, is the sin of fornication, which is related to the lust of the flesh.
[267]  Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
[268]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN DEALING WITH GOING TO SECULAR LAW Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:1-11
[269]  As we read this portion of 1 Corinthians, we need to get into the depths of these verses and not only care for what is written in black and white, but also touch the burden in Paul s spirit as he was writing.
[270]  I. BELIEVERS TO BE JUDGED BY THE CHURCH A. The Saints to Judge the World
[271]  In 6:1 Paul asks, Does any one of you, having a case against another, dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints?
[272]  The unrighteous are the unbelievers, who are unjust before God.
[273]  In verse 2 Paul continues, Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world?
[274]  In verse 9 Paul asks a question related to the kingdom of God: Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[275]  In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with matters in a particular sequence.
[276]  In verse 12 Paul twice says, All things are lawful to me.
[277]  The first use of these words is somewhat objective; the second use is very subjective.
[278]  Paul says, All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
[279]  C. Our Body to Be Raised Up by God
[280]  In verse 14 Paul says, And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise up us through His power.
[281]  Even now the Spirit of the resurrected Christ, who dwells in us, gives life to our mortal body Rom 8:11 , making it a member of Christ 1 Cor 6:15 and a temple of God indwelt by His Holy Spirit v. 19 .
[282]  In 6:15, 17, and 19 there are three crucial matters: first, that our bodies are members of Christ; second, that we are one spirit with the Lord; and third, that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.
[283]  In the context of dealing with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, Paul opens up these matters in a marvelous way.
[284]  Because we are organically united with Christ v. 17 , and because Christ dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 and makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 , our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him.
[285]  These verses in 1 Corinthians 6 are the only verses in the New Testament which tell us that our bodies are members of Christ, that we are one spirit with the Lord, and that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.
[286]  When we read these verses, however, we may take them for granted and may not spend adequate time to study them and the important matters revealed in them.
[287]  How much time have you spent on verse 15, which says that our bodies are members of Christ?
[288]  We the believers are joined to the Lord as one spirit.
[289]  This is a great mystery, perhaps the most mysterious matter revealed in the Bible.
[290]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY DEALING WITH THE ABUSE OF FREEDOM
[291]  IN FOODS AND IN THE BODY 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:13-20 TWO GROUPS OF PROBLEMS
[292]  As Paul was writing this Epistle, he must have been exercised to consider in what sequence he should deal with the different problems among the believers at Corinth.
[293]  The order in which Paul deals with the problems is not careless or insignificant.
[294]  In 6:13 and 14 Paul says, Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God will bring to nothing both it and them.
[295]  God has raised up the Lord bodily, and our body will participate in the Lord s glorious body in resurrection Phil 3:21 and be raised incorruptible.
[296]  Apart from being joined to the Lord in our spirit, it is impossible for our bodies, which are sinful and lustful, to become the members of Christ.
[297]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE DEALING WITH MARRIAGE LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 7:1-40
[298]  In 7:1-40 Paul comes to the fifth problem dealt with in this Epistle the matter of marriage.
[299]  This is treated according to the principles established in the preceding section 6:12-20 .
[300]  Many times those who are most cultured are the ones who have the most problems in married life.
[301]  In verse 7 Paul says, But I wish all men to be even as myself; but each has his own gift from God, one of this kind, another of that.
[302]  Since the Apostle Paul is so absolute for the Lord and His economy, he wishes all men to be as he is v. 8 . He desires them not to marry but to remain as he that they also may be absolute for the Lord s interests without distraction vv.
[303]  So That the Believing Party May Live in Peace
[304]  In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, But if the unbelieving one separates, let him be separated; the brother or the sister is not enslaved in such cases; but God has called us in peace.
[305]  To be not enslaved here means not under bondage, but freed from the marriage of a believer with an unbeliever, when the unbeliever leaves the believer.
[306]  However, in 1 Corinthians 7 it is not Paul s intention to stress the blessed side of marriage.
[307]  Paul was not only absolute for the Lord, but he was also absolutely one with God.
[308]  Because Paul was one with God, he answered the questions in such a way that the Corinthians would be helped to be one with Him in every circumstance, condition, and situation.
[309]  We know this by the fact that in answering certain questions Paul followed the principle of not initiating anything or changing anything.
[310]  If we change our status or initiate any action, this is an indication that we are not one with God and that we do not want to be one with Him.
[311]  In the foregoing messages we have covered the basic principles in chapter seven concerning marriage life.
[312]  In this message we shall consider the very important matter of the apostle s teaching.
[313]  We are told that when the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of the Lord came to them and enabled them to speak on God s behalf.
[314]  In 7:6 Paul says, But this I say by way of concession, not by command.
[315]  The word command here implies that the apostle in his teaching has authority to give commands to the believers.
[316]  Verse 25 says, Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
[317]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR DEALING WITH EATING OF SACRIFICES TO IDOLS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 8:1-13
[318]  We have seen that 6:12-20 may be considered an introduction to Paul s dealing with married life and to his dealing with the eating of sacrifices to idols.
[319]  Both marriage and eating have been ordained by God.
[320]  I. AN INADVISABLE EATING A. Not According to Love That Builds Up
[321]  In 8:1 Paul says, Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
[322]  In verse 4 Paul goes on to say, Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
[323]  To realize that an idol is nothing and that there is no God but one requires an inward, subjective consciousness derived from our spirit through our mind.
[324]  In verses 5 and 6 Paul continues, For if even there are so-called gods either in heaven or on earth, even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and we unto Him.
[325]  Verse 8 says, But food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we excel.
[326]  Those who eat idol sacrifices without having the proper knowledge will defile their conscience.
[327]  After making this matter clear, Paul goes on to say that food does not commend us to God.
[328]  The philosophical Greek believers at Corinth made everything complicated.
[329]  He encouraged the Corinthians to take the Lord, His ordination, and His sovereign arrangement.
[330]  Paul also realized that if we live Christ by being one spirit with the Lord and if we are submissive to the Lord and committed to Him, many complicated situations will be simplified.
[331]  Chapter nine is an insertion in the section on eating idol sacrifices.
[332]  In this insertion the apostle presents himself to the Corinthian believers as a pattern that they may not cause others to stumble, but build them up by practicing the principle of considerate love in 8:13.
[333]  In verse 3 Paul says, My defense to those who examine me is this.
[334]  We need to pay attention to the words examine and defense.
[335]  We have pointed out that 9:1-15 reveals how pure Paul was.
[336]  When we use the word pure here, we use it in a biblical sense.
[337]  For example, the Lord Jesus said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .
[338]  In verse 17 Paul continues, For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
[339]  In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
[340]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE TYPE OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:1-13
[341]  First Corinthians 10:1-13 is a special section of the Word, a portion written with the history of the children of Israel as the background.
[342]  Paul wrote this Epistle not only according to the situation at Corinth, but also with the history of the children of Israel as the background.
[343]  Israel is a complete type of the history of the church.
[344]  In 10:1 and 2 Paul says, For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
[345]  The words to be ignorant refer to the question Do you not know? in 9:24.
[346]  IN THE WILDERNESS A. God Not Well Pleased with Them
[347]  Verses 1 through 4 speak of the children of Israel in a positive way, but verses 5 through 11 picture them in a negative way.
[348]  In verse 5, a strong word of warning, Paul says, But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn along in the wilderness.
[349]  This signifies that although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan s bondage, and brought into the revelation of God s economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God s calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ Phil 3:12-14 , and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age Matt 25:21, 23 .
[350]  Verse 7 says, Neither become idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.
[351]  The abusive eating of the children of Israel was related to their idolatry in worshipping the golden calf Exo 32:1-6 .
[352]  The apostle s word here implies that the Corinthians eating of idol sacrifices without any consideration was also somewhat related to idolatry.
[353]  In verse 12 Paul says, So then, let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
[354]  Based upon the admonition in verses 5 through 11, the apostle warns the Corinthians not to think they are standing steadfast, with no danger of falling dead as the children of Israel did.
[355]  The word fall here refers to the children of Israel who failed, those who fell and died in the wilderness.
[356]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT GROWING INTO THE FULL POSSESSION
[357]  AND ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Heb 5:11-14; 3:6-19; 6:1; 1 Cor 3:1-3, 6-7; 2:14
[358]  In this message we shall see from Hebrews and 1 Corinthians that we need to grow into the full possession and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.
[359]  I wish to emphasize the fact that in gaining the good land the children of Israel were not defeated.
[360]  If we consider the history of the children of Israel, we shall not be disappointed with ourselves.
[361]  Instead, we shall realize that we can be compared to caterpillars in a cocoon undergoing the process of transformation.
[362]  Do not be disappointed, but worship the Lord from within your cocoon.
[363]  In verses 14 through 18 he speaks of the fellowship of the Lord s blood and body, and in verses 19 through 22, the separation of the Lord s table from the table of demons.
[364]  In verse 18 Paul again refers to Israel: Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices fellowshippers of the altar?
[365]  We have seen that in 10:1-13 Paul presents Israel as a type of the believers today.
[366]  We should not think that the remainder of chapter ten has nothing to do with the type of Israel in verses 1 through 13.
[367]  With this understanding of idolatry as a background, we need to ask what Paul means by the expression the Lord s table.
[368]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY THE LORD S TABLE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-22
[369]  As we read 1 Corinthians, it is very important that we understand Paul s central thought.
[370]  Paul realized that the philosophical Greek believers had gone astray from Christ.
[371]  Although they were genuine Christians, they were missing the mark concerning Christ.
[372]  God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[373]  If we have this realization concerning the Lord s table, we shall be able to understand 1 Corinthians 10.
[374]  Paul s concept here is that whenever a person eats of idol sacrifices, he enjoys something related to an idol.
[375]  Furthermore, what he enjoys gets into him and causes him to become an expression of that thing.
[376]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE THE PROPER EATING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:23 11:1
[377]  In 10:23 11:1 we have the conclusion of the section on the eating of idol sacrifices.
[378]  In these verses Paul speaks of the proper eating.
[379]  In dealing with the matter of eating, Paul s thought is very profound.
[380]  Verse 32 says, Give no occasion of stumbling both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God.
[381]  The Greek words rendered, Give no occasion of stumbling, may also be translated, Do not become a stumbling block.
[382]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO AN OVERVIEW OF FIRST CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 12:13; 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 1 Cor 11:3, 20, 23-25; 12:1; 15:12; 16:1-2
[383]  In this message we shall present an overview, a bird s-eye view, of 1 Corinthians.
[384]  Before we do so, however, let us first consider four verses, two from 1 Corinthians and two from 2 Corinthians.
[385]  In 12:13 Paul declares, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
[386]  Eventually, by drinking the Spirit we are saturated with the Spirit.
[387]  Then we become ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit 2 Cor 3:6 .
[388]  The new covenant is not of law, but of Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit.
[389]  Christ s becoming the life-giving Spirit implies all the steps of His process: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[390]  The factor needed for solving these problems concerning the proper daily Christian life is Christ.
[391]  If we enjoy Christ according to the way He is revealed in the first ten chapters of this book, we shall have the necessary factor to solve these six problems.
[392]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE DEALING WITH HEAD COVERING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:2-16
[393]  In this message we shall consider 11:2-16, where Paul deals with head covering.
[394]  In 11:2 Paul says, Now I praise you that in all things you remembered me, and hold fast the traditions even as I delivered them to you.
[395]  THE HEADSHIP In verse 3 Paul says, But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
[396]  THE HEAD COVERING A. Every Man Praying or Prophesying
[397]  Since man has the headship over woman and is God s image and glory v. 7 , he should keep his head manifested, unconcealed, uncovered, when he prays to God and speaks for Him in touching the throne of God s administration.
[398]  In verse 8 Paul gives us a second reason for head covering: For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.
[399]  That Long Hair Is a Dishonor to a Man,
[400]  but Long Hair Is a Glory to a Woman
[401]  Verses 14 and 15 say, Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him; but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her?
[402]  In chapter ten of 1 Corinthians Paul speaks concerning the Lord s table.
[403]  In verse 21 he goes on to say, You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons.
[404]  Since Paul has already begun to talk about the Lord s table, why does he not go on directly to speak concerning the Lord s supper?
[405]  In chapter ten Paul does not say anything about participating in the Lord s table until He comes.
[406]  The Lord s coming will bring in God s kingdom for His administration.
[407]  His first coming was for our redemption, but His second coming will be for God s administration.
[408]  Regarding the Lord s supper, Paul uses two crucial words: prove and discern.
[409]  Verse 28 says, But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
[410]  To prove ourselves is to check whether we are eating the bread and drinking the cup in a way that is worthy or in a way that is unworthy.
[411]  When Paul wrote this Epistle, some of the believers at Corinth ate the Lord s supper in an unworthy way, not realizing that the cup and the bread were uncommon and different from ordinary food.
[412]  In 11:17-34 Paul deals with the matter of the Lord s supper.
[413]  Let us consider the different points covered by Paul in these verses.
[414]  In verse 20 Paul says, When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord s supper.
[415]  Thus, their eating was not the eating of the Lord s supper v. 20 . In verse 22 Paul said to them, What! Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and disgrace those who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.
[416]  THE NEED OF PROVING AND DISCERNING A. The One Eating the Bread or Drinking the Cup
[417]  Being Guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord
[418]  In verse 27 Paul says, So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
[419]  THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD A. The Result of Not Proving and Discerning
[420]  In verses 30 and 31 Paul says, Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.
[421]  But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.
[422]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX DEALING WITH THE LORD S SUPPER 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:17-32 UNTO THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD
[423]  First Corinthians 11:24 and 25 say, And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is for you; this do for the remembrance of Me. Similarly also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, for the remembrance of Me. In the phrase for the remembrance of Me, it is better to translate the Greek word rendered for as unto.
[424]  Thus, it should read unto the remembrance of Me. The word unto implies a result, whereas the word for indicates a purpose.
[425]  Paul s word in chapter eleven is related to what the Lord says in Matthew 26:29: And I say to you, I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.
[426]  Our eating of the Lord s supper must result in a remembrance that is closely related to God s administration.
[427]  In 11:26 Paul says, For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes.
[428]  At the Lord s table, while we are eating and drinking, we are making a declaration.
[429]  We declare the Lord s death until He comes.
[430]  Between the Lord s two comings with their two goals, there is a long span of time.
[431]  The Lord s all-inclusive redemption has produced something unique the church.
[432]  Why does Paul deal with the gifts immediately after speaking about the Lord s supper?
[433]  Apparently there is no connection between the Lord s supper and the gifts.
[434]  If we would understand the connection between these two matters, we must see that they are related to God s administration.
[435]  In 12:1-3 we have the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.
[436]  In verse 1 Paul says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
[437]  In chapters twelve through fourteen Paul deals with the ninth problem among the Corinthians, the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God s administration and operation.
[438]  Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.
[439]  BY DIFFERENT GIFTS A. Distribution of Gifts but the Same Spirit
[440]  In verse 4 Paul goes on to say, But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[441]  In verse 7 Paul says, But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.
[442]  All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts.
[443]  Such manifestation of the Spirit is for the profit of the church, the Body of Christ.
[444]  For profit means for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ s Body.
[445]  According to the context of this book, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion 1:24, 30; 2:6-10 .
[446]  In 12:1-11 Paul stresses two matters: speaking and the Spirit.
[447]  If we are silent in our worship, then we become dumb worshippers.
[448]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:23-31 C. The Tempering of the Members
[449]  In verses 23 through 27 Paul speaks regarding the tempering of the members.
[450]  Verses 23 and 24 say, And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness; but our comely members have no need.
[451]  But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.
[452]  In 12:28-31 Paul speaks concerning the gifts God has placed in the church.
[453]  Verses 3 through 11 emphasize the Spirit, verses 12 through 27 emphasize the Body, and verses 28 through 31 emphasize administration.
[454]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 13:1-13
[455]  First Corinthians 13 is the direct continuation of chapter twelve.
[456]  In the last verse of chapter twelve, verse 31, Paul says, But earnestly desire the greater gifts.
[457]  V. THE EXCELLENT WAY FOR EXERCISING THE GIFTS A. The Need of Love
[458]  Paul takes a whole chapter to emphasize the crucial matter of love.
[459]  His first emphasis, on speaking, occupies just three verses; his second emphasis, on the Spirit, occupies nine or ten verses; and the third and fourth matter he emphasizes, the Body and administration, occupy sixteen verses and three verses respectively.
[460]  But when Paul comes to the crucial matter of love, he devotes an entire chapter to it.
[461]  In 13:8-13 Paul speaks concerning the excelling of love.
[462]  In verse 8 he declares, Love never falls away; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.
[463]  All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God s operation; they are not life to express God.
[464]  As Paul was writing chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of 1 Corinthians, there was a burden in his spirit and on his heart concerning certain crucial matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God s administration, and love.
[465]  These five matters are emphasized in chapters twelve and thirteen.
[466]  In chapter fourteen Paul comes to another main point: the superiority of a particular gift for the building up of the church.
[467]  OVER SPEAKING IN TONGUES A. Prophesying Building Up the Church More 1.
[468]  In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, Brothers, do not be children in your understanding, but in malice be babes, and in your understanding become full-grown.
[469]  The Corinthian believers were not only infants in life 3:1 , but also children in understanding.
[470]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:4-31; 14:1-25 THE PROBLEM CONCERNING
[471]  In dealing with the gifts, Paul emphasizes six matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God s administration, love, and the superiority of prophecy for the building up of the church.
[472]  In chapter twelve Paul speaks of the Body again and again, at least eighteen times.
[473]  In writing this Epistle Paul s intention was to correct and adjust the church in Corinth.
[474]  Paul s intention was to regulate the Corinthians, rescue them from their distractions, and bring them back to the central lane of God s economy.
[475]  My desire is to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ.
[476]  Nevertheless, especially as a help to the young people, I am burdened to make it clear why I do not encourage tongue-speaking.
[477]  Throughout the years much has been spoken and written concerning 14:26-40.
[478]  The reason for this is that in the New Testament there is not a clear word telling us how Christians should meet or how we should function in the meetings of the church.
[479]  This portion of 1 Corinthians is considered by some to be unique in the New Testament in that it seems to tell us how to function in the meetings.
[480]  This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching of the teacher to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation of the prophet, v. 30 to give visions of God s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God s mystery and the church as Christ s mystery, a tongue as a sign to the unbelievers v. 22 that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable.
[481]  We need to sing about how it pleased God to reveal His Son in us; about Christ living in us and about the fact that we have been crucified with Him; about walking in the Spirit and according to the regulation of the Spirit; about the need for a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may know the hope of God s calling, the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the greatness of His power exercised to raise Christ and set Him in the heavens; about the church being the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all; about the need to be strengthened into our inner man by the Spirit of God with might so that Christ may make His home in our hearts and that we may comprehend with all the saints the universal dimensions of Christ unto the fullness of God; about one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all; about walking in the truth of Jesus so that we may put off the old man, put on the new man, and be renewed in the spirit of our mind to have the reality of the new man; about the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; about magnifying Christ, living Him, being found in Him, pursuing Him, and having the excellent knowledge of Him; about Christ, the Beloved, as the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of creation.
[482]  In verses 27 and 28 Paul goes on to say concerning tongue-speaking, If anyone speaks in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and let one interpret; but if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the church, and let him speak to himself and to God.
[483]  Paul s use of the word church in verse 28 indicates that the church meeting is the church.
[484]  In these verses we see that Paul did not altogether neglect speaking in tongues, but instead gave some regulations concerning it.
[485]  The last part of verse 33 actually introduces verse 34 and reads: As in all the churches of the saints.
[486]  The word as indicates that all the local churches should be in the same practice.
[487]  First Corinthians 1:2 and 10:32 mention the church of God.
[488]  The church of God denotes the constituent of the church; the church is constituted of the element of God.
[489]  At the beginning of the church age, the saints were very simple.
[490]  They did not yet have the New Testament, and very few had copies of the Old Testament.
[491]  LIVING IN THE INDEX OF THE EYES OF CHRIST
[492]  The Lord Jesus is not a religion or a set of forms, regulations, or teachings.
[493]  He is a living Person whom we may contact day by day.
[494]  As the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling our spirit, He is real and available.
[495]  If we would have a proper Christian daily life, we need to walk according to the spirit.
[496]  It is significant that the New Testament does not charge us to walk according to the Scriptures, but to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .
[497]  In Galatians 5:16 Paul says, Walk by the Spirit.
[498]  In verse 25 he goes on to say, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[499]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE DEALING WITH THE MATTER OF RESURRECTION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:1-11
[500]  In 15:1-58 Paul deals with the matter of resurrection.
[501]  In 15:1 and 2 Paul says, Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you as the gospel, unless you believed in vain.
[502]  In this message we shall consider two matters in 15:12-28: Paul s rebuttal to those who claimed there was no resurrection, and the history of resurrection.
[503]  Verse 12 says, But if Christ is preached that He has been raised from among the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[504]  THE HISTORY OF RESURRECTION A. Christ, the Firstfruit of Those
[505]  In verse 20 Paul declares, But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.
[506]  Resurrection is a fact which has much to do with our daily life as Christians.
[507]  The daily life of a Christian actually depends on resurrection.
[508]  If we do not have Christ as the resurrection life within us, we cannot be living members of His Body for the carrying out of God s administration so that Christ may reign until He subdues all His enemies.
[509]  Verse 33 says, Do not be deceived, evil companionships corrupt good morals.
[510]  This appears to be a quotation of another saying of that day, a fragment of a Greek poem.
[511]  By this word the apostle warns the Corinthian believers not to have any companionship with those heretics who say there is no resurrection.
[512]  In the natural world we have many illustrations of resurrection.
[513]  In 1936 I paid a visit to one of the leading universities in China.
[514]  In this message we shall continue to consider the definition of resurrection and then go on to see the victory of resurrection.
[515]  In the last section of chapter fifteen, verses 50 through 58, we have the victory of resurrection.
[516]  In verse 50 Paul says, Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
[517]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE DEALING WITH THE COLLECTION OF THE GIFT
[518]  In this message we shall consider 16:1-24, the last chapter of 1 Corinthians.
[519]  In verses 1 through 9 Paul deals with the collection of the gift.
[520]  Verse 10 says, Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he is working the work of the Lord, even as I. In order for Timothy to be with the Corinthians without fear, they would have to be obedient and submissive to Paul s word.
[521]  In this verse Paul seems to be saying, You must be in the first day of the week, living in resurrection.
[522]  You must also be under the headship of Christ and of God, you must discern the Body, desire the greater gifts, practice the gifts in love, and be in resurrection.
[523]  Verse 19 says, The churches of Asia greet you.
[524]  Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church which is in their house.
[525]  This indicates that the church in Ephesus met in the house of Aquila and Prisca when they lived there Acts 18:18-19, 26 .
[526]  But in this Epistle he ends with a word of love: My love be with you all in Christ Jesus v. 24 . This is not natural love, but love in Christ, love in resurrection 4:21 , the love of God that becomes ours through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 . Of Paul s fourteen Epistles, only this one ends with such a word of the assurance of love.
