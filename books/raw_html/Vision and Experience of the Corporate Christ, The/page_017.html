 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE REVELATION AND EXPERIENCE<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF BUILDING</h2>
<p>As a child, I was told that the Bible is a record of God&rsquo;s creation. In a sense, this is correct, for the first two chapters certainly contain a record of creation. The first verse of the Bible says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; After I was saved, I was taught that the Bible is a book of salvation. This also is right, for Paul wrote to Timothy, &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:15). In all my years in Christianity, I heard many teachings concerning what the Bible is about, but I never heard that the Bible is a book of building. Yes, the Bible is a record of creation and salvation; however, the final word, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals that the Bible is about building.</p>
<p>When we visit someone, we usually begin by greeting the person. Then we may ask how the other person has been or talk about the weather or current events. This talk is merely our opening word. To learn what is on our heart, the other person must wait until our last word. Our closing word reveals our true heart&rsquo;s desire. In the beginning the Bible is a record of creation, and later it reveals the matter of salvation. However, only with the ultimate word do we see a clear vision of God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is neither creation nor salvation but a building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S HEART&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal is revealed in the last two chapters of the Bible. His heart&rsquo;s desire is a building, the holy city, the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 and 22 are the consummate, closing word of the divine speaking of more than one thousand chapters. The Bible begins with &ldquo;in the beginning,&rdquo; but it ends with a holy city coming down out of heaven from God (21:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Composition of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a city that is built, or composed, of three categories of precious things. The city proper is of pure gold (v. 18), and the street of the city is also of gold (v. 21). The wall of the city is built upon twelve foundations (v. 14). On the twelve layers of the foundation are twelve precious stones, and the foundations bear the names of the twelve apostles (vv. 19-20, 14). The wall, which is built on the twelve-layer foundation, is composed entirely of jasper (v. 18). According to Revelation 4:3, God, who is sitting on the throne, is like a jasper stone in appearance. Hence, the whole city has the same appearance as God, indicating that the whole city is the expression of God. The city bears the divine image&mdash;it expresses, manifests, and shines out God and all that He is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Destination Being the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>We need to see the consummate and closing word of the divine revelation in the Bible. Many people have read the Bible for many years, yet they do not know the closing word of the Bible. Every Christian knows that the Bible opens with creation, but very few realize that the Bible consummates with a building. We need to be clear that our destination after being saved is not heaven but the New Jerusalem. Our destiny is not to go up to heaven but to come down as the New Jerusalem. This is not my thought&mdash;it is the revelation of the Bible.</p>
<p>There is indeed a physical heaven where Christ the Son is with God the Father, but heaven is not God&rsquo;s goal or our destination. Our destination is something much better, higher, and more glorious than heaven; our destination is the New Jerusalem. Revelation 22:14 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; According to this verse, we will enter not into heaven but into the city, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven.</p>
<p>There are many traditional teachings among Christians today. The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, &ldquo;You nicely set aside the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition...You deprive the word of God of its authority by your tradition which you have handed down&rdquo; (Mark 7:9, 13). In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, we do not care for traditions; rather, we come back to the pure Word. We probably do not realize the degree to which we are still under the influence of traditional teachings. There is no verse that says that we will go to heaven after we die. However, the Bible clearly reveals that there is something glorious called the holy city and the New Jerusalem that will descend out of heaven (Rev. 21:2). Our blessed entrance is not into heaven but into the holy city (22:14).</p>
<p>We all need to see that the closing word, the ultimate word, of the revelation of the Holy Scriptures concerns building. The opening word concerns creation, and the word of process concerns salvation, but the closing and consummate word concerns building. We are all certainly part of God&rsquo;s creation, and as believers, we also participate in God&rsquo;s salvation. However, the goal is God&rsquo;s building.</p>
