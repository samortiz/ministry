   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEALING A BLIND MAN NEAR JERICHO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s unveiling of His death and resurrection the third time is related to the healing of the blind man near Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, the Lord s disciples were blind and in need of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They could not understand what the Lord was saying about His death and resurrection, because they were lacking in perception and insight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, following the third unveiling of the Lord s death and resurrection, we have the case of the healing of a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Sequence according to Morality</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 18:35 says, And it came about as He drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here there seems to be a problem with respect to Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter ten the Lord was received into Martha s home, and her home was in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His journey from Galilee to Jerusalem the Lord would have come to Jericho before He reached Bethany, and then He would have gone from Bethany to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why, then, is Bethany implied in chapter ten and Jericho clearly mentioned in chapter nineteen?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does this mean that He came to Bethany and then went back to Jericho?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, actually He was received by Martha after He passed through Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in chapter ten Luke is not concerned with geography or historical sequence; he is concerned with the high standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a strong evidence to show that Luke s narration is not according to the sequence of historical events but according to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sight and Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have pointed out that verse 35 says that the Lord drew near to Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The following verses indicate that near Jericho the Man-Savior healed a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that He healed the blind man before He entered Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Matthew 20:29 and Mark 10:46 say that the healing occurred at His coming out from Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke s narrative has a spiritual bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blind man s receiving of sight was followed in 19:1-9 by the salvation of Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that to receive salvation first requires sight to see the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two cases, occurring at Jericho in direct continuation, should be considered spiritually as one complete case.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight so that he may realize his need of salvation Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is covered in 18:35 19:10 shows how one can fulfill the conditions, as revealed in 18:9-30, for entering the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These conditions are first to receive sight from the Savior 18:35-43 and then to receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child to receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Blind Man Representing the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the blind man near Jericho heard that Jesus was passing by, he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me! v. 38 . The title Son of David is the royal title of Christ for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only the children of Israel were privileged to address the Lord with this title.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 40 and 41 continue, And Jesus stopped and ordered him to be led to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And when he drew near, He questioned him, What do you want Me to do for you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s question in verse 41 shows open love toward this needy one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It expressed the Man-Savior s humanity to an unimaginable extent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord then said to the blind man, Receive your sight; your faith has healed you v. 42 . Literally, the Greek word translated healed means saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instantly the man received his sight and followed the Lord, glorifying God v. 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord unveiled His death and resurrection to the twelve for the third time, they were still blind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, they were represented by the blind man near Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s healing of the blind man signifies His dealing with the blindness of the twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here I would like to say, once again, that it is not an easy matter to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In understanding the Scriptures it is not sufficient to know the letters in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would understand the Bible, we need to know the spirit of the particular book we are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The burden in Luke s spirit in this part of chapter eighteen was to show us that all the Lord s followers, even His twelve chosen ones, were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Pharisees were not the only ones who were not able to see the spiritual reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say that the twelve were foremost in lacking this ability.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Three of them Peter, James, and John were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although they saw so much on the mountain, actually, in a spiritual sense, they did not see anything at all, for they were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the man near Jericho was not the only one who was blind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those around the Lord also were blind.</S>
