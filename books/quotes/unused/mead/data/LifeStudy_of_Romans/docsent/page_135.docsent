   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH BEING THE LAST ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Death is not only God s last enemy; it is our last enemy too.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last enemy is not sin, the law, or the flesh; it is death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the eyes of God nothing is as abominable as death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not even sin is as abominable as death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God hates death even more than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin is against what God does, but death insults what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin opposes God s righteousness, but death insults God s very being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose a little boy plays in the mud and becomes very dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how dirty he may be, we still will love him and be willing to play with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, suppose the little boy dies and is laid out in a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although he may be fully clean, we will not want to be with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we will flee, not because he is dirty, but because he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am troubled by the fact that so many Christians fear uncleanness, but are not concerned about deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But, to repeat, God hates death more than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In typology, if a person was contaminated by an unclean thing, he could be cleansed rather easily and in a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if he touched any dead thing, it took him a longer period of time, at least seven days, to be made clean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that in the eyes of God death is more serious than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CARING FOR LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is better to make a mistake in functioning in the meetings than to be dead and not make any mistakes at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be wrong is not as serious as to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not function, you may be right, but you are right in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would rather see you livingly wrong than dead right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not encourage you to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But sometimes it is better to be more concerned about being living than about your being right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to recognize the symptoms of deadness to know whether we are dead or alive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus does not give yes-or-no answers to the questions addressed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, the Samaritan woman said, Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship John 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She was asking the Lord Jesus concerning the proper place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Was it in the mountain in Samaria or in Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus answered, But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him John 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, Worshipping God is a matter of life, and life is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a question of worshipping God on this mountain or in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The hour has come to worship God in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We find another example in John 9.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seeing a man blind from birth, the Lord s disciples asked Him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 9:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord replied, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him v. 3 . In John, the book of life, there are no yes-or-no answers; instead, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 7 the Lord s brothers in the flesh suggested that He go up to Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet fully come vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, verse 10 says, But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not publicly, but as in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see that the Lord answered and acted according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are all familiar with the record of Lazarus in John 11.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Lazarus sisters sent the Lord the news that Lazarus was ill and asked Him to come, He refused.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Having heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained then two days in the place where He was v. 6 . When the disciples expected the Lord Jesus to go to Lazarus, He did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when they had made up their minds not to go, the Lord said, Let us go into Judea again v. 7 . In all these cases we see that what the Lord Jesus did was always a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Genesis 2 there are two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Good and evil are also a matter of yes or no. Yes and no, right and wrong, good and evil, these come from the source of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to forget about the concept of yes or no and stay in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the way to be freed from death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way to be freed from death is not a matter of doing certain things; it is to stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we stay in the spirit, we shall walk and behave according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We shall have our whole being according to the spirit, and we shall think, express ourselves, and do everything in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then there will be no death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the way to be freed from death and to overcome the last enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Any death that still remains in our being is an abomination in the eyes of God, and we must eliminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must escape from the base of death in the flesh into our spirit, where Christ, our life, is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to stay in the spirit and behave according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do this, we shall be free from death.</S>
