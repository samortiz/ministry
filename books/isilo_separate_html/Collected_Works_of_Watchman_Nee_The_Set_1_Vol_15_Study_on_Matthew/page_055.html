And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve handbaskets full." Only after the loaves had been broken did the crowds all eat and become satisfied. When the Lord gives to people, He gives until they are fully satisfied. Another example of this is the living water becoming a spring and then also becoming rivers (John 4:14; 7:38). There were twelve handbaskets full of leftovers. This is a fact. Every time we offer something to the Lord for His use, there will always be an increase. Oftentimes after our work we sense a lack and thus need some spiritual cultivation. This is a great mistake if our life is like a car that is run by electricity, not by gasoline. The Lord was hungry, but after He gave the living water to the Samaritan woman, He Himself became full (John 4:6, 13-15, 32). Hence, we should feed others even when we ourselves are hungry; we must not be spiritually selfish. " Twelve handbaskets full." " Twelve" denotes eternal perfection, that is, the effectiveness of the Lord's death being eternally perfect. (The seven baskets full in chapter fifteen denotes the full perfection of God's Israel in the millennium.)</P><P>Verse 21:"And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children." Why were the women not counted? It is because the married women are one flesh with their husbands (see Gen. 2:24). Even if there were virgins, they needed to be hidden. As to the children, since they were not of age, they were not counted.</P><P>Verses 22-33:This portion is the third subsection of the second major section. It implies the Lord's resurrection, His ascension ("He went up to the mountain"), His intercession ("to pray"), the disciples' remaining on the earth, the great tribulation ("the fourth watch of the night," that is, the darkest period), and the Lord's coming back ("He came to them [the disciples]").</P><P>Verse 22:The "boat" is the church. The boat in the sea signifies that the church is in the world.</P><P>Verse 23:The Lord went up to the mountain to pray, signifying that He resurrected and ascended to the presence of God to intercede for the saints.</P><P>Verse 24:"Now the boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary." The wind being contrary signifies the persecutions that the church suffers in the world. That the Lord compelled the disciples to step into the boat means that He wants us to suffer trials in the world so that we may grow. This occurred in the night, meaning that after the Lord's departure from the world, the world has become dark, for the Lord is the true light (John 1:9; 9:5). The world has to wait until His second coming for the appearing of the morning star, the Sun of righteousness (Rev. 22:16; Mal. 4:2). Therefore, in the eyes of the Lord the church is a lampstand (Rev. 1:20) and the believers are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14).</P><P>Verse 25:"And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea." The fourth watch signifies the great tribulation, the darkest period. After the darkest time there will be the dawn. "Morning is coming, / But so also is night" (Isa. 21:12). This verse has the same meaning, that is, during the great tribulation the Lord will go to where the disciples will be.</P><P>Verses 26-27:Before this time people despised the Lord because He was not mysterious enough, and thus they did not believe Him (Matt. 13:54-57). But when the Lord became too mysterious, people were afraid of Him. Such was the case with the disciples. "Immediately" indicates the expression of the Lord's love; the Lord immediately comforted people.</P><P>Verses 28-31:This section concerns Peter's walking on the sea. We can see several principles here: (1) The Lord's calling needs our asking-"Command me to come to You" (v. 28). The believers should ask the Lord to command them. (2) The believers should imitate Peter's distinctive trait and his initiative in following the Lord. Peter came to the Lord by himself earlier than the other disciples did. (3) "Command me" (v. 28). This word indicates that Peter was obedient. (4) Although while in the boat Peter was bothered by the unsteadiness caused by the waves, he still made a move to advance farther. (5) "Come" (v. 29). This is the promise of the Lord's word. Without the Lord's promise, any move we take would be a senseless venture. People may say that Peter liked to be in the limelight. However, the Lord did not rebuke him; rather, He said, "Come," as a promise to him and also a commendation of him. (6) People think that there is security in the boat and that there is no need to walk on the sea to follow the Lord. However, we must know that the believers' life is altogether by faith. Corporately, it is easy to have faith; individually, it is difficult to have faith. However, faith is personal. Peter's walking on the sea was his personal faith, and it was praised by the Lord. (7) Taking risks is wrong. However, the believers should take risks based on the Lord's word. Such risks are risks of faith that produce experience and approvedness. (8) Since Peter did walk on the sea (that he did not sink immediately indicates that he could have succeeded in crossing), he should not have looked at the wind anymore. Since he had the word of the Lord, all the more he should not have looked at the wind. Once he looked at the wind, he immediately forgot the Lord's word. Without the Lord's word, he could not have walked on the sea even if the sea had been calm and unruffled. Since his walking on the sea did not depend on the wind or the waves, he should not have looked at them. When walking on the sea, one must look only at the Lord; then spontaneously he will not look at the wind and the waves. (9) The Lord expects to see that some will have an increase of faith to come down from the boat (the brothers and sisters in the church) and walk on the sea. (10) When one encounters the wind and waves, he must hold on to the Lord's word. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit, which is the only weapon used for active resistance. (11) Sometimes the believers do not have sufficient faith, yet the Lord's love is so great that He will still sustain them with His grace. (12) Before Peter began to sink, the Lord immediately stretched out His hand and took hold of him. (13) "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" (v. 31). Doubt comes from little faith. First there is little faith, then there is doubt.</P><P>Verse 32:"And when they got up into the boat, the wind ceased." " They" refers to Peter and the Lord. This was Peter's most satisfying and joyous experience.</P><P>Verse 33:"And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God." Those who were in the boat could not help but worship the Lord.</P><P>Verses 34-36:This is the fourth subsection of the second major section. It is a prefigure of the Lord's return to the Jewish land in the millennium.</P><P>Verse 34:"And they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret." Gennesaret means "the king's land of protection," that is, the kingdom. Jesus is already in the millennial kingdom.</P><P>Verse 35:"And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were ill." Since the Lord is the Lord Christ, He cannot hide His love, compassion, holiness, and righteousness. Can the believers be recognized as Christians? All those who were ill were healed simply by touching the Lord. How precious this is! Are all our prayers answered? I am afraid not. Even Paul's prayers were not all answered. Paul could not heal Timothy's stomach sickness (1 Tim. 5:23). Healing is a matter in the millennium.</P><P>Verse 36:"And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed." It is not necessary to touch His hand. It is sufficient just to touch the fringe of His garment. When we pray, we also need to touch the Lord. Unfortunately, many people crowd around Him, but few touch Him. How does one touch the Lord? When we come to Him, we must not be purposeless. Many times our faith, motive, and words show that we are not touching the Lord but crowding around Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
