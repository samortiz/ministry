   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Functions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the appointing of elders, the two crucial matters to consider are the matters of authority and life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once these two matters are clear, there can be an additional consideration, that is, how much function a brother has.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If two persons are similar in their submission to authority and in their condition of life, yet one has a greater function than the other, then the one with the greater function should be appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the appointment of elders one should pay attention to function, but function is not a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is truly important are the matters of authority and life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the elders submit to authority, they are qualified to represent authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders are the authority in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason they can be the authority is that they themselves submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who does not submit to authority is not qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I am under some people, and some are under me, my being under them is a matter of my submitting to authority, and some being under me is a matter of my being the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The degree to which an elder submits to God s authority will be the degree to which people submit to him as an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the children of Israel rose up against Moses, he did not say, I have authority, and I will strike you down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, when the children of Israel troubled him, he prostrated himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, God spoke on his behalf and defended him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God s speaking and defending take place in others spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit of God in the spirit of others causes them to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The saints submission to an elder is based on the elder s submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, the authority is not the elder, nor is it something of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The authority is God, and it belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The key is whether or not an elder submits to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may be concerned about others assuming authority, but it must be understood that nothing is more real and more difficult to feign than authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a person submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, he does not need to boast and say, I submit to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When others contact him, they can sense whether or not he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if he does not submit to the authority of God, no matter how much he tries to assume authority and declares himself an authority, his efforts will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When others contact him, they will be able to discern the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Saul is Saul, and David is David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we contact others, they know whether we are David or Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In regard to authority, a person simply cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Submission to authority is a serious requirement for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Appointment of Elders and Its Relationship</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>to the Condition of the Saints There Must Be Spiritual Saints</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>in Order to Have Spiritual Elders</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In regard to the appointment of elders, the saints also face a serious requirement; that is, they must be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Any time the saints do not submit to the authority of God and are not proper in their inward condition toward God, they will choose Saul and reject David.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if they submit to God, and are proper in their inward condition toward God, they will choose David and reject Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When an elder who is in the flesh meets with a believer who is in the flesh, they will either talk nicely or argue fiercely.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The flesh is able to be friendly or quarrelsome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The kind of elder a saint prefers shows the kind of person the saint is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who are deceived by fleshly elders are surely in the flesh themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This can be compared to a person who becomes sick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the body is weak, germs invade; however, if the body is strong, it is hard for germs to invade.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, never say that an elder has deceived you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have been deceived, this shows not only that he is living in the flesh but also that you are living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The kind of kings whom the children of Israel preferred was an indication of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that they wanted Saul to be king shows that they were like Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When saints in a church are fleshly, we should not expect the elders among them to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if the elders were spiritual, they would feel a need to be somewhat hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At such a time someone like Saul, who has a big stature, would surely rise up to lead them as king.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He would do so because there are many fleshly ones to support him, and it would be the best opportunity for him to be enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In contrast, when the saints learn to live in the spirit and submit to God s authority, there will be absolutely no place for Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a Saul rises up, the spiritual atmosphere will certainly subdue him, and he will not be given any ground.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then a David, a man according to God s heart, will rise up and reign for God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the condition of the elders in the church speaks forth the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, the condition of the church testifies of the condition of the elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A spiritual church will have spiritual elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way, the presence of spiritual elders indicates that the church is spiritual.</S>
