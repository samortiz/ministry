   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>During those three hours from twelve o'clock until three o'clock in the afternoon, the universe became dark, and the veil in the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom Matt 27:45, 51a .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that Christ tore the separation between God and man through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only so, the earth was shaken and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had died were raised vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>51b-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were not resurrected yet, but they waited for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time that Christ resurrected, they also resurrected, and they came out of the tombs and entered into the holy city and appeared to many v. 53 . Where they went after this we have no way to trace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these things indicate that Christ's death was not just a death caused by man, but a death carried out by God directly, according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, in the third aspect, He Himself was willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was not forced or compelled to die, but He poured out His life, His soul, to die for us Isa 53:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His resurrection Christ as the processed One, that is, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 7:37-38, at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles, the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word indicates that His believers would receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, at that time the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified v. 39 . The Holy Spirit of God was there, but He was not there as the Spirit, because before Christ's resurrection the Holy Spirit of God had not been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Jesus entered into resurrection, He was immediately glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, on the day of His glorification, that is, the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not come back to teach them; rather, He breathed on them and told them to receive Him as the Spirit John 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before Christ's resurrection, such a Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because many Christians know little concerning the produce of Christ's resurrection, they have not seen that in Christ's resurrection, He as the last Adam became a life- giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many do not even believe that today Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They consider this a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In their consideration, the three of the Trinity are separate the Father is the Father; the Son is the Son; and the Spirit is the Spirit and it is wrong to say that the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say that the Son one day became the Spirit is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we say that Christ is not the Spirit, we annul 1 Corinthians 15:45b and 2 Corinthians 3:17, two verses that indicate clearly and confirm strongly that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus became such a Spirit by passing through the process of death and the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He reached the stage of resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the first item of the produce of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's resurrection produced the life-giving Spirit.</S>
