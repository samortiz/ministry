Because of the invasion of the Japanese army, I could not leave my hometown. Thus, Brother Nee and I were separated for a time. I stayed in northern China, and most of the co-workers remained in the interior. Through my experiences in traveling and speaking to many denominations, I realized that there was very little result. That caused me to make a decision not to travel anymore. Instead, I would stay in Chefoo to build up the church there.</P><P>In 1938 Brother Nee went to England and stayed there for one and a half years. He was also invited to visit some of the Scandinavian countries. He returned to Shanghai in 1939. That summer he had a conference on the Body of Christ. I received a cable from him asking me to attend this conference. I brought four young co-workers with me to this conference in August 1939. Through this conference we received a vision of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In 1940 he began to have a series of trainings. During that time he also had a conference in Shanghai about every two months. Furthermore, he spoke every Wednesday evening concerning the Body of Christ and God's eternal purpose. At that time I saw the blueprint of the practicality of the church life. I took this blueprint back with me to Chefoo, and for about two years we practiced what Brother Nee had seen. This brought in a great revival.</P><P>Meanwhile, there was a big turmoil in Shanghai in 1942, forcing Brother Nee to stop his ministry. This rebellious turmoil and the persecution of the Japanese army caused the church in Shanghai to close down. While the church in Shanghai was passing through this turmoil, there was a revival in Chefoo with the practicality of the church life.</P><P>Later, I was put into prison by the Japanese army for one month. After I was released from prison, I became sick with tuberculosis on the lungs. The Lord brought me through this illness within two and a half years, and after the war I was invited to come to Shanghai in 1946. It was there that Brother Nee and I met together again. We had been away from each other for more than six years. Because we had not had any correspondence during that time, I was concerned about whether what we had practiced in northern China was right. I presented everything that we had practiced in those years to Brother Nee, and he encouraged me to bring the same practice to the other churches.</P><P>I began to minister in Shanghai again, and there was a revival there in 1947. Through this revival, as I have pointed out previously, Brother Nee's ministry was recovered. When his ministry was recovered, there was an even bigger, broader revival among us. Eventually, about eighty to one hundred saints attended a six-month training with him in 1948. After that period of training, the trainees went to many cities, spreading the revival throughout China.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
