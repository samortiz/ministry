   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham entered into the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When his descendants fell away from that good land, God brought them out of their fallen place and restored them to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What was the ultimate consummation of the entering into the good land by the children of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, the temple was God s expression, and, on the other hand, it was God s kingdom, government, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There, with the temple, we can see God s expression and God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There, with the temple, God and all His people were able to rest and be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The good land is a combination of the proper earth and the proper people with God s dwelling place built up to express God and to exercise His authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament we see a miniature of the good land: an elevated land surrounded by death water and filled with God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There in that land were God s expression and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the miniature in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fulfillment of this figure is found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ultimately, in the New Testament, God will have a new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will not just have a tract of land but a whole new earth, an earth resurrected and elevated above all death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this new earth there will be no more sea, no more death, and no more night Rev 21:1, 4, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All sea, death, and night will be gone forever, and there will be a clean, clear, dry land with a pure river flowing through it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Jerusalem will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That will be God s eternal habitation, expression, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There God will be fully expressed and His authority will be completely exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That will be the fulfillment of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where is our good land?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is there on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A FORETASTE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord that the church life today is a foretaste of the new land with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church life today is on the new land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anaheim may be old, but we are on new, elevated land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a foretaste of the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are we not in the New Jerusalem today?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not in the full taste New Jerusalem, but we are in the foretaste New Jerusalem, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is our good land today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the Jewish people had was only a type, a prefigure, of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Jerusalem there will be the fulfillment and the full taste of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we have in the church life today is real, but it is not yet full.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are in the reality, not in the type, but this reality is just the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In nature, the foretaste is exactly the same as the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So, in foretaste, we are in the New Jerusalem and we are on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many of us were in the region of old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some were in Catholicism and others were in Judaism.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Did you have the feeling that you were tasting the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The taste in the New Jerusalem is mainly the living water and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Jerusalem our taste will mainly be that of the living water for us to drink and that of the tree of life for us to feed upon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What drinking we have enjoyed since coming into the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The water we drink in the church life is much better than any earthly beverage.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No drink on earth can compare with what we are drinking in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, day by day we are enjoying the Lord Jesus as our tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who can be as pleasant and joyful as we are?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are truly in the foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this good land we have God s dwelling place, rest, expression, authority, kingdom, and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church life is where we all can rest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Day by day I am resting, not working.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While I am working, I am enjoying the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why it is difficult for me to be worn out, to be tired out, because I am resting, not working.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every cell in my body and every drop of my blood is resting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Oh, what an enjoyment this is!</S>

   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This signifies the rich life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ s life is the animal life for redemption and the plant life for regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are now enjoying the milk and honey life flowing in the good land.</S>
