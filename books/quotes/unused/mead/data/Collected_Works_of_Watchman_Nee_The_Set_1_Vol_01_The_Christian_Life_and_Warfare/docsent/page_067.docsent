   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VICTORY IN SUFFERING.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This aspect of the victorious life is to be found in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>35-39.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Apostle says, "We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter....In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"More than conquerors" when you are ill-treated, and when for Christ's sake you are counted, like Christ, a lamb only fit for slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"For Thy sake...killed!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not nice to be considered a sheep fit for slaughter; it is not "dignified"!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no room for pride here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was not much room for "dignity" in the Lord Christ's Calvary death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He was led along the road with a crown of thorns upon His brow, with the blood upon His face, after walking seven miles during the night, as He was moved from place to place there was not much "dignity" there was "no beauty that we should desire Him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not a "dignified" death!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was put to open shame!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With God's children, the thing which hurts them most is the thing that touches their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not mind being put to shame before God, but they do mind being put to shame before men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How they blush over anything that humiliates!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But that all dies when the believer feels that he is really</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>suffering with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It does not say "killed" for "your own sake," but "for Christ's sake."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not say beaten and whipped because you have been wrong, but beaten and whipped because you have been right!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If ye do well and suffer for it, and take it patiently, this is grace; but if ye do wrong and suffer for it, and bear it patiently, what thanks have ye see 1 Peter 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is victory and being a conqueror in suffering for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do wrong, and "suffer for it," you must not call that "suffering with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"For Thy sake...killed...in all these things more than conquerors!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the triumph of the spirit of the Lamb, in suffering "for Jesus' sake," and this is victory over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>VICTORY OVER SATAN.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In having victory over Satan you conquer in quite another way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Enduring grief, suffering wrongfully, with patience and a loving spirit is the true spirit-life of one who is joined to Christ, in the attitude to the human beings who are the visible and immediate cause of his suffering, but this is not to be the attitude to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have not to be a "lamb" to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Be a "lamb" to the people, be patient with them, love them, be "more than conqueror" by showing the Spirit of the Lamb to them, but at the same time you must take an attitude of resistance against the devil according to 1 Peter 5.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>8, 9 and James 4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are therefore three aspects of the victorious life 1 The aspect towards sin, Romans 6, "dead indeed unto sin"; 2 the aspect towards the people, "more than conquerors" when they "kill" you; and 3 the aspect to the devil, "Resist the devil" in the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 6 depicts this last aspect of the victorious life in resistance to the foe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord Jesus was the "Lamb" towards men, He was a "Lion" to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are told that He shook off from Himself the principalities and powers and put them to open shame, and what was defeat in the eyes of men was victory in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What was "shame" in the eyes of men was glory in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Towards Satan and all his wicked hosts Christ was a LION the Lion of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Ephesians 6 we see something of the spirit-warfare the Lion-life against the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see the soldier, with the spirit of the soldier "Henceforth be strong."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the human side Christ was "crucified through weakness," but He was "strong" stronger than the "strong man."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His name is called Strong "When the Stronger than he shall come upon him."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So Christ's name is the "Stronger than he."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is stronger than the "Strong man."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So to the believer standing "in Christ" and facing Satan-wards, the message is "Be strong."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must not now talk of "weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may be weak in your humanity and in yourself, but you must be</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"strong in the Lord."</S>
