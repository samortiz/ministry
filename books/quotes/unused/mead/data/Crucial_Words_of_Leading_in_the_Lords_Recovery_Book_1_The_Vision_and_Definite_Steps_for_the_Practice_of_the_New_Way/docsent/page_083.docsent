   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Succeeding in the Truth-teaching Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, the elders must build up the truth-teaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These meetings must become the center of all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these meetings we must not only teach the truth but also help the saints to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the future all large meetings and consolidated gatherings should be truth-teaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not have sermon meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our sermon meetings are truth-teaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning the teaching of the truth, the Lord s recovery should be the most qualified and experienced among the Christian groups in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our teaching has spread even to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one s teaching can compare with ours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Truth Lessons have rich main points, clear outlines, simple and concise language, and are easy for new believers to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, we should never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should study and improve our teaching and delivery skills.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The important thing is that we must not only teach, we must also make our meetings living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do this, we can bring our friends and relatives to the truth meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that in the coming days, the truth meetings will be the most attractive meetings in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to turn with the age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today everyone wants knowledge and information.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even an unbeliever wants to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we preach in an ordinary way, others will not be attracted; however, if we speak logically, concisely, clearly, and with much content, others will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The whole world knows that Christianity teaches the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone more or less respects the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we can present the truth properly and clearly, based upon this well respected classic, others will rise up to admire it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today most people have received a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most people are college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot invite people to come listen for an hour and a half to a message given in a sloppy manner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what we did before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truth meetings, however, present a simple and clear message that is packed with truth and logic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will easily touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To the educated and thoughtful people, this is very effective and attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we must make the truth meetings our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should even use these meetings to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would practice this, it will become a new move in Christianity; others will not be able to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actively Visiting</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Communities and the Campuses</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Third, we need to actively engage ourselves in the visitation work in the communities and on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The co-workers and elders need to take the lead to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today Taiwan is growing rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The expansion in the big cities mainly revolves around the new urban communities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are high-class, young, and ambitious people living in these new communities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of these urban developments are more advanced than those in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not bring the gospel to them, we will miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must take action and begin visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not the only ones who have noticed this phenomenon; the denominations are also paying attention to these new developments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we take the initiative, we will gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we wait until Christianity has started their work, it will be difficult to catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the co-workers and the elders need to wake up and take the lead to visit and work in these communities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the next term of the full-time training, there will be three hundred trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every week they will spend two days visiting the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this work is not primarily theirs; this work belongs to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders must, therefore, stir up and encourage all the local saints to do their best to cooperate and coordinate together in the visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the future the spreading of the gospel will depend almost entirely on the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must go to the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In addition, the campuses are important targets.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Taipei we should work to gain the students and to prepare the best material for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should build up a strong testimony on all the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>FOCUSING ON THE CAMPUS WORK</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have a proposal concerning the campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope we will fellowship thoroughly concerning this proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must locate good meeting halls adjacent to good universities such as National Taiwan University.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The location must be right, and the building must be large enough.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hall three was originally remodeled for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, National Taiwan University is located near hall nineteen, and hall nineteen is not suitable for this use.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I visited that hall once and was discouraged by what I saw.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The location is hidden, and the hall is shabby.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I were a college student, especially from overseas, I would surely hesitate to go to such a hall.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even if I wanted to become a Christian, I would not want to enter such a shabby-looking place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let me say a word to the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For a brief time let us forget about Lin-ko.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us focus on this goal and this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Secure a large and suitable building near the campus for a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Find one that will hold at least three to four hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>National Taiwan University is the top university in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This university produces all the top people and has a large student population.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should have the foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we want a campus work, we must work on National Taiwan University.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I ask the co-workers to give me the liberty to bring up some old complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You have been under my training for many years and have been serving this entire time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why have we not had this kind of view?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have always boldly declared that we are for the campus work, but what has been done on the top campus in the country?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If I were taking the lead in the church in Taipei, I would surely go back to all of the meeting halls and fellowship aggressively about this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I would encourage all the brothers and sisters to make offerings for a new building near the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should have this kind of spirit and this kind of view.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the reason I was merciless to the co-workers when I came back a year and a half ago.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I was clear that if I was nice and polite, our work would not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I hope we will pray much before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today we are engaged in the heavenly King s enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are building up His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We want to be faithful to Him; for more than two or three decades we have given up everything and consecrated our all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What have we accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>According to my observation, we have managed to hold on to a certain attainment; we have maintained a certain amount of truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But what have we actually accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In reality we are merely eking out a living.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should not be that passive and impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should shake off this lethargy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should have a proper and practical plan concerning the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Some meeting halls are five or six stories tall.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What is the use of having such tall buildings in places that do not have a good campus?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the saints cannot afford to give for the campus, I do not believe we need to keep the big meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We can sell three or five of these halls and direct the money to a large facility by the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even if we can gain only one hundred students from the campus, this is still worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When a nation launches a project, it cannot spend too much time calculating the cost involved; it can only count on the success of the project.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If the project succeeds, it is worth the expense.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I hope the elders will pray and fellowship thoroughly concerning this matter during the elders meeting.</S>
