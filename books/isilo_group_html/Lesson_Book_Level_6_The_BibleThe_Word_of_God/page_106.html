<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Jewish believers in the dispersion in the Gentile world (1:1 footnote 3). According to the degraded condition of the church in chapter 2, and the commending words spoken concerning the apostle Paul in 3:15-16, this book may have been written after the martyrdom of Paul, possibly around A.D. 69, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and it must have been written shortly before Peter&rsquo;s martyrdom (1:14).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the divine provision and the divine government.</p>
<p>C. The background: See this section under 1 Peter.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [The subject of 1 Peter is the Christian life under the government of God. The book of 2 Peter is a continuation of 1 Peter, and it also emphasizes God&rsquo;s government. However, in this Epistle we also see God&rsquo;s provision. Therefore, we may say that the subject of 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government.</p>
<p>With God&rsquo;s government there is God&rsquo;s provision. God grants us His provision so that we may cooperate with His government. In other words, if we would carry out God&rsquo;s government, we need God&rsquo;s provision; that is, we need the divine supply. In 2 Peter the writer first presents the divine supply. We see how God&rsquo;s power provides all the supply for our need. This is the main significance of this book. Furthermore, the Epistle of 2 Peter shows us a continuation of the picture of God&rsquo;s government unveiled in 1 Peter. Therefore, what we have in 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [After a word of introduction (1:1-2), Peter speaks concerning the divine provision (1:3-21). The divine provision includes two matters: the impartation of the divine power (1:3-11) and the shining of the divine truth (1:12-21). Regarding the impartation of the divine power, we have two main points: all things related to life and godliness with the divine nature (vv. 3-4) and the development by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom (vv. 5-11). Regarding the shining of the divine truth, there are also two main points: the glory of the apostles&rsquo; witnessing (vv. 12-18) and the light of the prophetic word (vv. 19-21).] [In 2 Peter 2 we see God&rsquo;s judgment on the false teachers (2:1-3), God&rsquo;s judgment of old on both angels and men (vv. 4-9), and the evils of the false teachers and their punishment under God&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 10-22).] [In 3:1-9 we see God&rsquo;s judgment on the heretical mockers.] In 3:10-12, [Peter speaks concerning God&rsquo;s judgment on the heavens and the earth.] [In verse 13 we have the expectation of the new heavens and the new earth filled with God&rsquo;s righteousness; in 14 to 16, the preparation for the coming judgment; and in 17 and 18, the conclusion, where we are told to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;to the believers allotted like precious faith (1:1-2), 2) the divine provision (1:3-21), 3) the divine government (2:1&mdash;3:16), and 4) conclusion&mdash;to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord (3:17-18).</p>
