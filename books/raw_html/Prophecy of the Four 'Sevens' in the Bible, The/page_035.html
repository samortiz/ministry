<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The City of Jerusalem<br>and the Cities of the Nations Falling</H2><P>The great earthquake causes the city of Jerusalem and the cities of the nations to fall (Rev. 16:19a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Physical Babylon the Great,<br>the City of Rome,<br>Being Given the Cup of the Wine<br>of the Fury of God's Wrath</H2><P>The physical Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, will be given the cup of the wine of the fury of God's wrath (Rev. 16:19b). Rome has given the wine of the fury of her fornication to the faithful saints among the nations (Rev. 18:3). Then God in vengeance will give her the wine of the fury of His wrath.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Every Island Fleeing<br>and Mountains Not Being Found</H2><P>After the seventh bowl is poured out with the greatest earthquake, Revelation 16:20 says, "Every island fled, and mountains were not found."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Weight of Every Hailstone Being a Talent,<br>and Men Blaspheming God<br>Because the Plague Was Exceedingly Great</H2><P>Revelation 16:21 says that great hail comes down out of heaven upon men. The weight of every hailstone is a talent, about one hundred pounds, and men blaspheme God because the plague is exceedingly great. In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God. This proves that they have no intention to repent. Rather, they will fight against God to the end.</P>
