   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Matthew 13 we go on to 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter Paul clearly states that we are God's farm, that he planted and Apollos watered, and that God gave the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the development of Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 3 shows that in the development of the seed, God's co-workers are planters and waterers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not say that Paul taught and Apollos edified and God gave the graduation certificate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter there is no teacher, but there is a planter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no edifier, but there is a waterer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We thank God for the planting, for the watering, and for the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is one side of the development.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another side is found in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Galatians 1:15a and 16a, the Apostle Paul said, "It pleased God..to reveal His Son in me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means God sowed Christ into him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God the Father reveals His Son in us, He sows Christ into us as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, Christ is revealed in us; second, Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates growth and development.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul said, "until Christ is formed in you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ not only lives in us, but He is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be formed in us means Christ becomes fully settled within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times I have used the illustration of a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A glove was made to contain a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes it may be difficult to put our hand into a glove in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must gradually insert each finger forcibly until it fits exactly into the fingers of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This illustrates Christ living in us and endeavoring to be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is waiting for an opportunity to spread into every inward part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He is able to do this, He will be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will be the reality of Ephesians 3:17 which says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heart is composed of the mind, the will, the emotions, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the center of our heart is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is in the center, awaiting the opportunity to spread out of our spirit into our mind, emotions, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then Christ will settle Himself in every part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that Christ makes His home in our heart, occupying and possessing our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the spreading of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spreading of the indwelling Christ is simply the growing of the seed of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we may have previously heard about the increase of Christ within us, we perhaps did not realize that this increase within us is simply the growth of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The increase of Christ within us is both the growth of the kingdom and also the gradual coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom comes by the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the indwelling Christ is spreading and growing within our inward parts, the kingdom is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even now the kingdom is coming, although somewhat slowly due to the condition of our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we will render the Lord more adequate cooperation, the speed of the coming of the kingdom will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many think that the kingdom of God will come automatically and that we can sleep while we wait for it to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you take this way, you will sleep for two thousand years and still the kingdom will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The kingdom does not come in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the kingdom comes by the growing process of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the indwelling Christ grows in us, it means that the kingdom has gained more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The full coming of the kingdom will be the maturity of the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The maturity of the growth of Christ within us is the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are waiting for the coming of the kingdom in a growing way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While we are waiting, we are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While we are growing, the kingdom is coming, for our growing is the coming of the kingdom.</S>
