   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the end of December 1947, Sister Peace Wang, Sister Rachel Lee, and I first visited the church in Hong Kong and then proceeded from there to visit the churches in Canton, Swatow, Amoy, and Foochow, Watchman's hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During our three-week stay with the church in Foochow, a revival came in.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before returning to the south, I composed and compiled The Chinese Gospel Hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While we were staying in Foochow, Watchman inspected the manuscript and polished some of the gospel songs, especially the one entitled You Need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following the conference in Foochow, we stayed with Watchman another two weeks to fellowship with him that the recovery of his ministry must be sped up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the other co-workers and leading ones heard about this fellowship, they also would not leave, but asked us to obtain permission from Watchman that they might also participate in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At first he would not give his permission, but on further entreaty, he agreed for them to be present on the condition that they would sit a distance away from him in another section of his spacious living room.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only Peace Wang, Rachel Lee, and I sat together with him for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I opened the fellowship by asking him why all the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung were filled with confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately he responded by releasing a message on the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word poured out of him for over an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We sat there astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To our surprise a sister sitting among those far away burst out, "Why should we not do it right now according to Brother Nee's message?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee responded, "If you wish to do it, you must all hand yourself over to the work the ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sign a note indicating your consecration, and pass it on to Brother Lee."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This they all did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the leading brothers of the church in Foochow heard about this, they came that evening and handed over both themselves and the church to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This stirred up all the saints in town, and Watchman decided to call a meeting of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He asked me to speak at that meeting, but I told him strongly that if he would not go and speak, I would not even attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He therefore took up the burden and spoke at that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us realized that this was the beginning of the recovery of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hundreds of us rejoiced over this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These events transpired in March 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I then told him that over forty co-workers and seeking ones would be attending a conference in Shanghai in April, which had already been scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I asked him if he would take care of this conference, and he agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In one of the conference meetings in Shanghai, he requested that we sing the spiritual prose on the life of the grapevine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His desire after so many years of suffering was to express his spiritual sentiment through the singing of that prose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I then put it into meter, and we sang it in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That conference broadened the revival which had already been brought into Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also through that conference Watchman's ministry was fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time he decided to have a six-month training in the training center on Kuling Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peace Wang, Ruth Lee, and I were assigned to stay in Shanghai to care for the church and the supply of the training.</S>
