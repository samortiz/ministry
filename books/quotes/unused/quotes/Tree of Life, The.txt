God created man in His own image for the purpose of having man as His very expression in this universe and on this earth
God created a corporate man in His image to express Himself, so man is the very image, the very expression of God
God has an enemy in this universe and on this earth, and this earth has been usurped from the hand of God, robbed away from God
The serpent in Genesis 3 and the scorpions in Luke 10, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits, are creeping things
God committed His authority to man that man may have not only the power but also the authority to rule the whole earth and to subdue it
In Genesis 1 there is the purpose the intention of God but there is not the way to fulfill Gods purpose the way to attain Gods intention
If God is life within you and lives in you, it is possible for you to live God out, to express God in a full way
For these two aspects of God's purpose, God's expression and God's representation, we need God to be life to us
With nearly all the religions there is the same one thought that God is the Creator and that we are the creatures
The first mentioning of Gods dealing with man is that God put Adam in front of the tree of life charging him to be careful about his eating
God's intention is not that we serve Him, do good to please Him, or that we worship Him in a religious, ritualistic way
He later told them that He came not to be a king to rule others outwardly but to be the bread of life to be eaten
The Lord does not want us to consider how to serve Him how to worship Him or how to glorify Him but He wants us to consider Him as our food
Immediately after the creation of man, God put man in front of the tree of life that man may take the tree of life as his food
God's first intention is not to have man toiling, but to have man feasting and feeding on Him, to have man enjoying God Himself
In the Gospel of John, the Lord is first seen as life , as the bread of life , as the water of life , and as the breath of life, the air
You have to realize that the Lord as the living water is within you as the living spring in the deepest part of your being
If you read the whole context of John 4, you will realize that this living water, the spring within us, is in our spirit
If you are going to drink of the Lord, do not think that the Lord as someone outside of you will come into you
You have this living spring within you, but this living spring may be shut up, concealed, confined, and closed deep within you
We have such a living supply within us, so now we have to learn how to open ourselves to the Lord as our living, inward life supply
If you would open yourself to the Lord in such a way, you will see how real, available, and precious the Lord is
You have to learn how to take Him in, how to enjoy Him, how to feed on Him, how to drink of Him, and even how to breathe Him in
During this time, forget about your needs, your business, your family, your home affairs, your work, and everything else
If you try to take care of other things while you are eating, your enjoyment of the food will be limited and you may not digest it so well
We all need to set apart a time, free from all outside disturbances, in which we open our entire being to the Lord just to enjoy Him
We are somewhat abnormal because we are too active in doing, too active in working, but very passive in eating and enjoying the Lord
We do not enjoy the Lord so much, so we have a very poor expression of the Lord and a very weak representation of the Lord
Before man contacted the tree of life by exercising his spirit, Satan came in and man was tempted to partake of the tree of knowledge
God's intention was that the tree of life would get into the spirit of man, but before this the tree of knowledge got into the soul of man
After they came out of Egypt, they were wandering in the wilderness and were taught to live on the heavenly manna
The lamb of the Passover, the unleavened bread, and the heavenly manna on which the children of Israel lived are types of Christ
According to the picture in the Old Testament, only a minority, the children of Israel, were occupied and gained by God
They learned to live, to exist, to move, to have their being, not according to the worldly way but according to the heavenly way
We see a picture of two minglings: first, the mingling of Satan in the soul of man, and second, the mingling of God in the spirit of man
He is the Lamb of God, the unleavened bread, the heavenly manna, the tabernacle with all the offerings, and everything
The Jewish religionists searched the Scriptures for knowledge, yet they would not come to the Lord Jesus for life
The Epistles show us that it was due to the teachings and the gifts that divisions began to exist among the Christians
Paul points out in 1 Timothy that the different teachings are the seed, the source, of the church's decline, degradation, and deterioration
Satan, the subtle one, came in to utilize even the good teachings and the proper gifts to seduce people from Christ
Finally, at the end of the Scriptures, in Revelation, the worldly system is portrayed as being married to religion
If we are not clear about this vision, it will be easy for us to be seduced from the way of life into something other than the Lord Himself
On the positive side, there is another line in the New Testament, the line of the mingling of God with the spirit of man
We are charged to walk in the spirit, to live in the spirit, to do things in the spirit, to pray in the spirit
When we learn to walk according to our spirit, we will not walk according to the worldly system but according to the heavenly way
According to the record of the New Testament, even the teachings and gifts by themselves are categorized with the tree of knowledge
In Matthew 16, Peter thought that he was saying something good to the Lord, but the Lord rebuked him, calling him Satan
We have to learn how to contact Him, how to realize Him, and how to experience Him in the spirit as our life and everything
All the positive things come out of the experience of the tree of life, out of the mingling of Christ as life with our spirit
We need to spend our time to read the New Testament once more with this point of view, the point of view in the spirit
It was through Christ as the Lamb of God that we were brought back to enjoy Him as the tree of life once again
With the sacrifice of the Passover lamb, the children of Israel enjoyed the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs
They enjoyed the pillar of cloud by day, the pillar of fire by night , the heavenly manna , and the living water from the cleft rock
After man fell, God provided the lamb for man to be redeemed, and eventually God became the very temple to man
One day the Triune God, who is the reality of the tree of life and of all the other positive items in the Old Testament, came to be a man
The divine Spirit and the human spirit are mingled together as one spirit, and this mingling is the mutual abode
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Another strong verse to prove that the Son is the Spirit is 2 Corinthians 3:17 which says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
In John 20 the Lord Jesus came to His disciples after His resurrection, breathed into them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Christ was incarnated to be the embodiment of the Triune God, and He became the Spirit who is the transmission of the Triune God
Although there are many other items of Christ in John's Gospel, these are the six major items for our enjoyment
Christ is our life , but for life to be maintained there is the need of Christ as our light , food , drink , air , and an abiding place
We need to be impressed that the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit to be everything to us
When we go to the Lord to spend personal time with Him, we have many aspects of His wonderful person for which to praise Him
Because we have received Christ, we have been born 'not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God'
When we initially received Christ as the tree of life, a birth occurred and a life relationship with God was established
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus did not say that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in the heart
When we received Christ by calling upon the name of the Lord, Christ as the Spirit came into us just like the air
We need to know this living One in a living way so that the indwelling Christ as the inner life can transform our entire inward being
From the time that man was created, God first presented Himself to man as the tree of life in the form of food
The first mentioning of something in the Scriptures is always a governing principle a principle which governs all the Lords dealings with us
The basic principle of the Lord's dealings with His people is that they would enjoy Him as their food, their life supply
The Gospel of John tells us that one day this very God, who in the beginning presented Himself to man as food, was incarnated as a man
God in the form of a man presented Himself to man again as food, as the heavenly bread of life , that man may partake of Him
After the fall, we need redemption, so in Genesis 3 a lamb was prepared and provided by God for His fallen people
The animal life involves the shedding of blood for redemption which can bring us back to the enjoyment of the nourishing and generating life
The book of Leviticus shows us the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
All these offerings typify different aspects of Christ for our enjoyment, and all of them except the burnt offering were for eating
We have to realize that the temple of God, the house of God, is not only something for God but also something for us
In John 14 the Lord Jesus says that in His Father's house are many abodes and that He was going to prepare a place for us
The types figures and shadows of the Old Testament provide a clear picture that Gods intention is to present Himself to us as our enjoyment
We need to enjoy Him as our life, our food, our drink, our light, our air, our dwelling place, and as our everything
The house of the Lord is the fullest expression of the tree of life and the fullest enjoyment of what the Lord is to us
Psalm 368 says They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
Some people may criticize you by saying that you are wasting your time, but actually you are not wasting your time
Jesus, the incarnated God, was the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, and He told us that He was the temple
It is not enough to have some objective knowledge about the Lord and to learn many doctrines and teachings concerning the Lord
The seeking one in Song of Songs said, 'As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons
The apple tree is not for the scientific study of the seeking one but for her to rest under its shadow and enjoy the fruit
We must learn to know the Lord in such an experiential way, day by day tasting Him and being satisfied with Him
If we enjoy the Lord in this way, this enjoyment will create a deep hunger within us for the Lord's heart's desire, His dwelling place
Within the tabernacle is the showbread table which is the source, the fountain, of life, and the lampstand, which is the source of light
If we enjoy Him in such a living and real way as the tree of life, we will have the tabernacle and we will be in the house of the Lord
We will be like the sparrow who has found a house and the swallow who has found a nest for her young in the altars of the house
The church life will be our resting place and a nest to take care of the younger ones whom we have brought to the Lord
After the fall and its development, God changed His ordination, giving man not only vegetables but also animals to eat
The Lord Jesus as the bread of life indicated that He was a continuation of the tree of life for man's nourishment
The Old Testament saints continued to enjoy God in many aspects, and eventually, they enjoyed God to the fullest extent as the temple
At the end of the Old Testament the temple is the product of the enjoyment of God and is the fullest enjoyment of God
His forerunner, John the Baptist, declared that He was the Lamb, and the Lord Himself declared that He was the temple
In John 3:14, the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself, showing that He was in 'the likeness of the flesh of sin'
The Lord indicates here that He is the door not only for God's chosen people to go in, but also for God's chosen people to go out
Now, since Christ has come, all God's people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
Christ is our shepherd, the door for us to leave the fold of the law, and the pasture, the feeding place, after we leave the fold
The strongest thing in the whole universe besides God is death, yet even death cannot hold the resurrection life
The Lord Jesus is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and as the Spirit, the Son is revealed and realized
The fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation
The prayer of the Lord concerning the divine oneness in chapter seventeen is fully answered and realized in the New Jerusalem
If we read the Scriptures again to find out what are the aspects the items of God being our enjoyment the Bible will become a new book to us
The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
On both sides of the water of life, there is the tree of life , which is the nourishment, the supply of life, to all the redeemed ones
The Triune God is the very content of this universal building and is enjoyed by His redeemed ones in the fullest way
The book of Genesis shows us the source of the tree of life, and the book of Revelation gives us the consummation
After the resurrection and ascension of Christ, many things were accomplished by God; thus, God has many attainments
All of what God is, all of what God has accomplished, and all of what God has attained is in this Spirit, this breath
The unbelievers who are going to receive Christ do not need to go to heaven to bring Christ down or go to the abyss to bring Christ up
If they would exercise their mouth to call, 'Lord Jesus,' Christ as the all-inclusive breath would come into them
According to the Gospel of John, this wonderful divine Spirit came into our human spirit at the time we received Him
1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,' and Romans 8:16 says, 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit'
John 7 tells us that rivers of living water will flow out of the innermost being of the person who believes in the Lord Jesus
Through Christ's redemption, by His blood, we have been cleansed and purged to fit His purpose of indwelling us
If you open to Him, you will know how to deal with your wife, not in the way of mere mental knowledge, but according to the life within
He does not need a religion with various kinds of teachings, practices, and gifts; rather, He needs this flow of life from within us
The entire sixty-six books of the Bible are the Holy Spirit's revelation and are the speaking from God by men borne by the Holy Spirit
The entire Bible was inspired by the one Spirit and was written with a definite purpose to show us God's heart's desire
As God is the God of the living and is called the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so the dead Abraham Isaac and Jacob will be resurrected
From the divine title of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Lord Jesus saw the truth, the fact, of resurrection
If God is the God of Abraham, who has died, Abraham will be resurrected because He is not the God of the dead but of the living
The Lord needs to bring us into the understanding of the Scriptures in an inner and living way to see what is on His heart
The Christian life is not merely a matter of doing or working, but a matter of partaking of God as the tree of life
In order to make coats of the skins of the lambs, God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve
Now we have to go on to see something more, something richer, something deeper, and something higher than enjoying Christ as the Lamb of God
All the offerings are based on two things-on the tree of life, the vegetable life, and on the lamb, the animal life
All the offerings are Christ, all the furniture in the holy place is Christ, and all the items related to the furniture are Christ
In other words, how can we have a turn from the experience of Christ in the outer court to the experience of Christ in the holy place?
In the outer court, the priests first enjoyed all the offerings in the aspect of Christ as their righteousness
When you see the vision of eating the Lord and begin to feed on the Lord, this feeding turns you from the outer court into the holy place
In Exodus 12, the children of Israel enjoyed the shedding of the blood of the Passover lamb to fulfill the righteous requirement of God
In the wilderness the children of Israel enjoyed manna daily and in the holy place the priest enjoyed the showbread
After the son came back, the father clothed him with the best robe and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
Many Christians treasure the fact that Christ is their righteousness, but they neglect the eating of Christ for their inward enjoyment
God used Martin Luther to recover the truth concerning justification by faith with Christ as our righteousness
If the father in Luke 15 had only dressed the son up and then told him to do something for him, he would not have had the strength
After we have been brought to the table to feed on Christ as our feast, we will be so active, waiting for the Father's command
The father of the prodigal son dressed him up outside the door for him to come in and feast at the table where they could eat and be merry
In our experience are we outside the door of the Father's house or inside the door feasting on Christ with all His riches?
You may be outside the door clothed with the best robe, with a ring on your hand and sandals on your feet, but how are you within?
Christ as the Lamb of God enables us to be justified by faith so that we can be brought back to the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life
We need a vision to see that the whole Bible presents us a picture that God is the tree of life good for food to us
All the positive stories in the Bible show us God's chosen people enjoying God as the tree of life in different aspects
After we enjoy Him in His redemptive aspect, we immediately have to enjoy Him as the nourishing, energizing Lamb
There will be a house, a temple, for the Lord's rest, and in this temple we will enjoy the Lord in the fullest way
Finally, the house, the temple, will be enlarged to the city, which is the ultimate consummation of God's eternal intention
Corinthians 15:45 says, 'So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Corinthians 15:45 does not specifically say that Christ, the Son of God, or that Jesus became a life-giving Spirit
The Lord revealed how He would become a life-giving Spirit in John 14-16, and this way is recorded in John 18-20
With this Spirit, life comes into us; with this life we have light; and with this light we have all the riches of what this God-man is
When you enjoy Him by feeding on Him as life, you will be nourished, and at the same time you will sense the washing
The Word, which is God, passed through the processes of incarnation, human living with its sufferings, crucifixion, and resurrection
All the items of what Christ is with all of His processes are condensed and included in this life-giving Spirit
You may know that Christ is the Son of God, that He is the Lamb of God who died on the cross for your sins, and that He is the Savior
The book of John is concluded at the end of chapter twenty with the Lord breathing Himself into the disciples as the Holy Spirit
Of this Gospel, proving and confirming that this life-giving Spirit is not only with but also within the disciples
When the disciples backslid in John 21 by going back to the sea to take care of their living, the Lord was present with them the whole time
When Peter told the other brothers that he was going fishing, they followed him to return to their old occupation
They fished the whole night and caught nothing, but even on the land where the fish were not, the Lord could provide fish for them
He continued to say that He would receive the disciples to Himself that where He is the disciples might also be
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
It should be after His resurrection that the Lord lives in His disciples and that they live by Him, as mentioned in Galatians 2:20
Verse 23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
Eventually, it will be a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him
The Lord was not going to heaven to prepare a heavenly mansion for us in order that we might go there one day after we die
When a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it grows up and the life within it is imparted into many grains
The Father's house is the building, the temple, which is the total of all the abodes, the total of all the regenerated people
The Father's house is actually a mutual abode, a mingling of the Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people
John 14-16 shows us that through death and resurrection the last man, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
On the evening of His resurrection, He came to the disciples not in the form of the flesh but in the form of the Spirit
Within this allinclusive dose is the cleansing element which cleanses away all our sins cleanses away the world and cleanses away even Satan
On the positive side, the life-imparting element, the nourishing element, the supplying element, is within this Spirit
The Triune God has passed through many processes to become an all-inclusive dose so available to each one of us
In the all-inclusive dose, there is the germ-killing element, dealing with our flesh, our self, Satan, and the world
Brother Watchman Nee once told us that a person can commit suicide in many ways, but no one can commit suicide by means of crucifixion
The more you absorb the life juice of Christ as the tree of life, the more you will sense the killing element within you
The Triune God is the tree of life to us and we can share of this tree of life because of His incarnation plus His death and resurrection
Also, by His death and resurrection, He became a Spirit; He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, a life-giving Spirit
Through our abiding and our enjoying Him, the church will come into existence as the real expression of the Triune God
How important it is that we know this tree of life and that we experience this tree of life in such a living way!
In the first epistle He talks about eating the tree of life which was mentioned at the very beginning of the divine revelation in Genesis 2
Previously, we have seen that eating is the turning point from the outer court of the tabernacle into the Holy Place
In John 6 the Lord tells us that He is the bread of life and that the one who eats Him will live because of Him
The six books in the Old Testament from 1 Samuel to 2 Chronicles give us a full record of the building of the temple
If you read these books carefully, you will see that the temple was a product of the enjoyment of all the produce of the good land of Canaan
The Lord told the Jewish religionists that they searched the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to Him that they might have life
To search the Bible for knowledge is one thing, but to come to the Lord to contact Him for life is another thing
The learned Gentiles, the Magi, did not know the Scriptures concerning where Christ would be born, but they went to the newborn King
There is only one way for the Lord to get into us and for Him to mingle Himself with us and that is by our eating Him
After the creation of man, the first thing mentioned about the relationship between man and God is man's eating
In the book of Ezekiel there are three great chapters-chapter one, chapter thirty-seven, and chapter forty-seven
Many Christians are indifferent to the things of the Lord and are worldly and even sinful, backsliding far away from the Lord
There are however some seeking ones among the Lords children who have been revived by the Lord and to a certain extent experience the Lord
Many of them have been distracted to pay their full attention to the study of the Word merely for the sake of gaining more knowledge
The consummate number in the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying God multiplying Himself with man, God mingling Himself with man
At the end of Revelation there is the same thinga city foursquare with three gates on every side signifying the Triune God mingled with man
The requirements of God's glory, God's righteousness, and God's holiness kept fallen man from the tree of life
Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help'
There is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are accountable'
If man is going to eat the tree of life, he has to fulfill the requirements of God's glory, God's righteousness, and God's holiness
On the other hand, all the requirements of God's glory, God's righteousness, and God's holiness have to be fulfilled
Christ had to fulfill the requirements of God's glory, righteousness, and holiness through His death on the cross
In order for the watermelon to get into the children the sequence is first watermelon, then slices, and finally juice
Throughout our Christian life, we have been listening, learning, seeing, reading, and studying, but we have not been eating
May the Lord be merciful to us and deliver us from the doctrines and from the teachings that distract us from the enjoyment of Christ
Our wonderful Lord, the tree of life, the Word become flesh, the God-man, died to pave the way and to prepare the place
By His blood, our conscience has been purged, so our spirit is cleansed and free from any kind of condemnation
The more we open ourselves to the Lord from our spirit, the more we have the peace and the sense that He is one with us
The background of the book of Hebrews is related to the Judaizers distracting people from the enjoyment of Christ
They may have told a Hebrew believer, 'We are the descendants of our forefathers who received the law from our God
If we are going to deal with a living Person, who is Christ, the life-giving Spirit, we have to learn how to exercise our spirit
We must learn how to exercise our spirit to contact this heavenly and spiritual Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit
When we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we sense that we are in the Holy of Holies and that we are touching the throne of grace
Included in this life-giving Spirit are Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
God's righteousness, holiness, and glory and the fulfillment of all the requirements are also included in the life-giving Spirit
We should have the full peace, the full confidence, the full boldness, and the full assurance to come to contact Him
By the fall, Satan brought all these negative things to man, which are against God's glory, God's holiness, and God's righteousness
In the outer court is the righteousness of God; in the Holy Place is the holiness of God; and in the Holy of Holies is the glory of God
The ark of testimony is the very embodiment of God and inside the ark is the hidden manna, which signifies that God is our enjoyment
Included with this tabernacle are justification in the outer court sanctification in the Holy Place and glorification in the Holy of Holies
These chosen people are justified, sanctified, glorified, and built together to form the tabernacle, the Body, the church
With God's purpose there is the kingdom, the church, the Christian living, walk, or conduct, and the Christian work, service, or ministry
With the kingdom of God, the church of Christ, the Christian living, and the Christian ministry, there is a seed
Satan's aim is to frustrate the growth of this seed because the growth of this seed will bring forth the kingdom
The kingdom is something of life and of the enjoyment of God as the tree of life for the transformation of life
The Lord Jesus revealed that the kingdom of God is the Savior Himself, who was among the Pharisees when He was questioned by them
The more we enjoy Christ as the tree of life, the more the element, the reality, of the church will be growing up
They said that the teachings of Confucius were much better, ethically speaking, than the teachings of the Bible, and they could prove it
Our behavior, our living, our conduct, our walk, must be the outcoming of Christ, the fruit of the Holy Spirit from within us
The Christian walk is not a kind of living corrected, adjusted, taught, and disciplined by the best teachings of the philosophers
The Christian living is something flowing out from within us by our taking Christ as life, by our living in the Holy Spirit
We have to give the seed of life, which has been sown into us, an opportunity to grow up and to grow out of us
The work is not a matter of how much we can do or accomplish, but a matter of how much of Christ we can live out, flow out
Christ is the seed of the kingdom, the seed of the church, the seed of the Christian walk, and the seed of Christian service
May the Lord help us to realize what it means to have Christ as the seed in the kingdom in our church life in our daily walk and in our work
We need to look at a number of verses which show that Christ as the seed of life is the seed of everything related to God's purpose
In Acts 5:20, an angel of the Lord told Peter, 'Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life'
Romans 521 says That as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
The Christian behavior, the Christian conduct, is not just something of human morality, but it is something of divine expression
The Christian work, the Christian service, or the Christian ministry is not just an activity but an overflow of the inner life
Matthew 15:21-28 records the Lord's contact with a Canaanite woman: 'And Jesus went from there and departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon
The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord, a divine person, and the son of David, a royal descendant, great and high to reign
Matthew 22:2 says, 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son'
Corinthians 1124 says And having given thanks He broke it and said This is My body which is for you this do unto the remembrance of Me
Corinthians 11:25 continues, 'This cup is the new covenant in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me'
Revelation 19:9 says, 'And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb'
Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
The Lord is the Spirit that gives life, and this life-giving Spirit is the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ
If we do not exercise our spirit while reading the Word, the Bible is the tree of knowledge to us and not the tree of life
After we understand something, however, we have to exercise our spirit to touch that portion of the Word by the way of prayer
If we consider the written Word to be something different from the living Word, the written Word will be dead knowledge to us
Many wives are very familiar with Ephesians 5:22 which says, 'Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord'
We have to realize that the submission to the husband which the wives should have is nothing less than Christ Himself
You will be afraid of making a mistake with your husband and you will be on the alert all the time to make yourself so submissive
After our prayer in the proper way to contact and enjoy the Lord as our submitting life, we will sing hallelujahs and praises to the Lord
By the mercy of the Lord, we need to keep the Bible as a book of life, the tree of life, not as the tree of knowledge
Always remember that we have to read with our eyes, understand with our mind, and receive and feed on the Word with our spirit by praying
When the Word becomes the Spirit it is life, and when it becomes life it is the life supply, the food, that nourishes us
There is a real need for us to spend some time to sit at the table to feast on the Lord, to eat of the Lord, day by day
Matthew 4:4 says, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
The divine concept concerning God's Word is that it is food by which we are not only taught but also nourished
Corinthians 3:1-2a says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
Whether the Word is mere knowledge to us or food depends on how we take it and depends on what part of our being we exercise to take it
The Bible does teach us certain things, such as Ephesians 6:1 which says, 'The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right'
The Bible says that the wives should be subject to their own husbands, but we must look at the context of this teaching in Ephesians 5
A wife should submit to her husband in the condition of being filled in spirit and of being in the fear of Christ
It will not be their doing, their behavior, their conduct, but it will be the overflow of Christ from within them
Whenever we read the Bible, we have to receive it in the spirit as an expression of Christ in order to make Christ the reality of that word
The problem with many Bible students is that they have isolated the Word from Christ by reading it merely in the mind or with the mind
Ephesians 6:18 tells us that we need to receive the Word of God 'by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit'
If someone were to ask him how he knows it is delicious, he could only respond that what he is eating tastes delicious
We may pray according to our mentality, our own inclination, our own emotions, and our own desires and not care for the Spirit in our spirit
The more we pray in this way, the more we are dried up with no watering, no anointing, no oiling, no refreshing, and no strengthening
Matthew 6:33 says, 'But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
Husbands should not pray too much concerning their wives, and the wives should not pray too much concerning their husbands
At the beginning of John 17 is the glorified Father, in the middle is the holy Father, and at the end is the righteous Father
We need to be clear about the position and function of the heart and about the difference between the heart and the spirit
The new spirit mentioned here is not the Holy Spirit because in verse 27 there is another Spirit which will be put into us, into our spirit
A pure heart and an empty spirit are the two main conditions for the nine blessings spoken by the Lord in Matthew 5
Peter 34 says But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of God is costly
The wives' adornment before God should be their inner being-the hidden man of their heart, which is their spirit, in meekness and quietness
A person may dress in nice clothing which is the adornment of the outward man, yet this person may have a proud spirit
Many times we may be willing to receive the word, but we only receive it superficially because there are some rocks in our heart
The anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires concerning other things choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
If the soil of our heart is the wayside, trodden by the world and preoccupied by many things, it becomes hardened
The rocks are hidden sins personal desires selfseeking and self pity which frustrate the seed from gaining root in the depth of the earth
We may seemingly be a good brother or a good sister and yet we are superficial with the Lord because of the rocks in our heart
If we are going to have the Lord as the seed of life grow within us to be our full enjoyment, we have to deal with our heart
Our heart will be good, right, proper, released, and prepared for Christ as the seed of life to grow within us
Our heart is the crucial factor in our enjoyment of the Lord as the life-giving Spirit and in our being transformed into the Lord's image
If we are going to enjoy the Lord as the living Spirit and be transformed by Him, we have to deal with our heart
The three parts of the soul are the mind, the knowing part , the emotion, the loving part , and the will, the deciding part
The inward parts include not only the mind, but also the emotion and will, which are the composition of the heart
When we mean business to repent to the Lord and confess all our failures before God, our emotion will immediately be moved and touched
The mind of the heart turns, the conscience of the heart is opened, and the emotion and will of the heart follow
In the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord tells the saints again and again to repent
The result will be that our heart will be fully opened to the Lord, and the Lord will have a way to fill us with Himself
Besides dealing with the Lord to be pure in heart, we need to go on even deeper to be those who are poor in spirit
The heart acts in cooperation with the spirit, but the spirit is the organ for us to directly receive and contact the Lord
We should not have two faces, pretending to be one way to a brother's face, but undermining him behind his back
We all need to look to the Lord that we would learn the lesson of dealing with all these negative things in our being
We need to ask the Lord to grant us a pure heart with a mind that always turns to Him and that is set upon Him
We need to ask the Lord to grant us a conscience that is always exercised to confess our failures and our sins before Him
The Lord will have the way to make our emotion so fervent and zealous for Him with a will that is submissive, pliable, and strong
We will experience and enjoy Christ, and He will have the opportunity, the capacity, and the space to grow within us
May the Lord grant us a proper heart and a proper spirit for us to experience and enjoy Him as the tree of life
After God created man He put man in front of the tree of life which signifies the Triune God to be our life our enjoyment and our everything
By man's eating of the tree of life, the very Triune God could come into man and mingle Himself with man to make Himself one with man
We need to look to the Lord that He would give us a heavenly, spiritual view of this picture presented to us in Genesis 2
We all need to be transformed from men of clay vessels of clay into precious materials for Gods buildinggold bdellium and precious stones
If we are going to be transformed from clay into precious material for God's building, we have to eat the fruit of the tree of life
If we eat the fruit of the tree of life, this life becomes the pure, heavenly, living, and spiritual water flowing within us
When we enjoy the Lord as the tree of life, this life flows within us and transforms us into the image of Christ
Paul tells us that the apostles are God's fellow-workers, God's co-workers, who labor on God's farm to plant and to water
Out of this growth we become the proper materials for the building up of the church, which are gold, silver, and precious stones
The Apostle Paul mentions silver instead of pearl because in Genesis 2 sin had not entered yet and there was no need of redemption
Now we need to go on to see how human beings of clay can be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones for God's building
When Christ as the divine life is added into us some spiritual chemistry takes place and there is a metabolic change in our being
In the church we can have the heavenly, spiritual gold, silver, and precious stones by Christ as life transforming us
They also point out that the common food that we buy becomes sanctified through the word of God and our prayer
She may be helped to realize that she has been positionally sanctified, that her position has changed in Christ
She exercises to take this standing with the realization that she has been transferred out of Adam and into Christ
Eventually this dear sister will discover that it does not work just to have the realization that she is positionally sanctified
We should never accept a teaching that says that we have become so spiritual and holy that it is impossible for us to sin
By enjoying Christ as life and by being filled with Him as life, His life swallows up all the negative things in our being
We are being metabolically transformed into His image and all the negative things within our being are swallowed up
Teaching people to correct themselves to adjust themselves or to improve themselves is not the right way the heavenly way or the divine way
King David preserved his life, restored to him all his inheritance, and invited him to feast with him at the same table
As the counterpart of Christ, the holy city satisfies Christ, and as the dwelling place of God, the holy city satisfies God
Justification is for sanctification, sanctification is for transformation, and transformation is for God's building
We are transformed and thus conformed into the very image of Christ that we may be materials good for God's building
God's image will be expressed among us and through us, and His authority will be exercised among us over the enemy
In the Scriptures a wonderful, mysterious, and glorious fact is revealed, that is, God's intention is to mingle Himself with us human beings
The first illustration of God's intention in the Scriptures is the tree of life, which is to be taken as food into our being
During the Passover, the children of Israel slew the lamb, and the blood of the lamb was shed for their redemption
There are two illustrations in 2 Corinthians 3 that also illustrate God's heart's desire to mingle Himself with us
The first illustration is that we are the letters of Christ inscribed with the Spirit of the living God on our hearts
The second illustration in 2 Corinthians 3 is that we are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord
All believers of Christ should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their being
Christ desires to be written into every part of our inner being, our heart, but we may be preoccupied by many other things
Our heart may be preoccupied with our family, our material possessions, our education, our job, or our future expectations
Although we may come to the church meetings, we need to ask ourselves how much of Christ has been written into us
For Christ as the Spirit of the living God to be inscribed into our being is for Him to mingle Himself with us
Many Christians' hearts are indifferent toward the Lord and the Lord has gained very little ground within them
His enemy may be able to frustrate Him a little bit, but this frustration gives Him an opportunity to display His multifarious wisdom
The other brother is not good according to his natural disposition, but gradually more and more of Christ has been wrought into him
We need to be encouraged that no matter what kind of person we are the Lord will work out His purpose of transformation in us
We need to be patient with one another in the church life because more and more of Christ is gradually being wrought into us
The second illustration in 2 Corinthians 3 is that we are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord
We are mirrors beholding Christ and reflecting Him, but the problem is that sometimes our heart is turned away from the Lord
Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory even as from the Lord Spirit
To eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him in is to allow Him to write Himself into us, to inscribe Himself into us, by our beholding Him
He is the living Spirit waiting within us, so we need to learn to turn ourselves to the Spirit and open to Him
We have seen that God presented Himself to us as the tree of life for our enjoyment in the form of food that we may eat of Him
Throughout the whole Bible God's unique intention is that we would take Him into us and enjoy Him within as our life and everything
Beside the tree of life there was a river of water flowing and dividing into four branches, going to the four directions of the earth
God who is so living will come into us as our life, and this living One who is God Himself as life to us will become a flow within us
Right away after we were saved, after we received Christ as our life, we did have the sense that within us there was something flowing
Before considering the final picture in the Bible in Revelation, we should see God's intention with life in the Gospel of John
According to the record of the Passover in Exodus 12, the lamb was not only good for redeeming but also good for nourishing
The height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, but the height of the city itself is twelve thousand stadia
At the foot of the mountain the wall is built, and on the top of the mountain there is the throne of God and the Lamb
Genesis 2 tells us that the tree of life is good for food and Revelation 717 216 and 2217 tell us that the water of life is good for drink
After we receive God the Son, the Lamb, as our Redeemer, the water of life, the Spirit, starts to move and flow within us
After we receive Him, the flow of the Spirit will move within us, and in this flow, Christ is the tree of life as the life supply
The more we enjoy the flow of living water within us, flowing with the tree of life as the supply, the more we will be transformed
On the night when the Lord was betrayed, the Lord told the disciples that He would be smitten and that they would be scattered
While he sat outside in the courtyard, a maid, not a big soldier, came to him and said, 'You also were with Jesus the Galilean'
If we would confess all our sins and admit and recognize that He died on the cross for our sins, right away there would be a flow within us
The New Jerusalem unveils the redeeming Lamb, the flow of life, the supply of life, the transformation of life, and the building up in life
The church life is composed of a group of people who realize that they are sinful and admit that God, as the source of life, loves them
We confess all our sins to Him, and we admit and recognize that He is our Redeemer, the Lamb of God, who died for us to take away our sin
All the redeemed ones are the tabernacle to God for God to dwell in, and God Himself is the temple to us for us to dwell in
We have to enjoy Him all day long by feasting on Him as the tree of life and drinking of Him as the water of life
May we realize that He is within us as the tree of life, supplying us all the time by the flowing of the Holy Spirit within us
