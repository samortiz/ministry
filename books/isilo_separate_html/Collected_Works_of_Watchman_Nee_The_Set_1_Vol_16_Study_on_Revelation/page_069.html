Revelation 19:5</H2><P>"And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great."</P><P>This is the last time that the throne is mentioned (this is different from the great white throne). The throne is in God's temple. Here there is only a temple but no city. In the new heaven and new earth there will only be a city but no temple. Therefore, after verse 5 there is no more mention of the throne.</P><P>The "voice" is the voice of the Lord Jesus because in 5:6 the Lamb is "in the midst of the throne."</P><P>"All His slaves" are those in the church, because this book emphasizes the responsibility of the individuals in the church before God. "Those who fear Him" are the Jews and Gentiles who fear Him.</P><P>"Praise our God." This is what the Lord always says (see Heb. 2:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 19:6</H2><P>"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</P><P>"The voice of a great multitude" is the voice of many people; "the sound of many waters" is a continuous voice; and "the sound of mighty thunderings" is a solemn voice.</P><P>The word for "reigns" in the original text indicates that He has already been reigning. "The Lord our God the Almighty" has always been King, but His reign was not manifested until now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB<br>AND THE MARRIAGE DINNER<br>(REVELATION 19:7-10)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 19:7</H2><P>"Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready."</P><P>Who is "His wife"? This cannot be the church for the following reasons:</P><P>(1) The great multitude in 19:1 includes saved Gentiles, saved Israelites, and of course, the church. The church is included among the great multitude that proclaims the words in 19:7. Since the church proclaims this, "His wife" must refer to someone else.</P><P>(2) Matthew 25:1-13 speaks of the whole church, but only the five wise virgins are qualified to attend the feast.</P><P>(3) The wife here is different from the bride mentioned in Paul's Epistles. The bride Paul speaks of is clothed with Christ, whereas the wife here is clothed with her own righteousnesses. In Paul's Epistles the church as a whole is Christ's bride. In Revelation each church is seen separately, and, therefore, the responsibility of the church before God is emphasized. In Paul's Epistles the church is accepted in Christ, but in Revelation the church is accepted because of her own conduct. In Paul's Epistles all of those in the church belong to Christ, while in Revelation she is divided into the saved ones and the overcomers.</P><P>The five wise virgins in Matthew 25:1-13 are only those attending the feast; they are not the bride.</P><P>The wife of the Lamb is composed of the overcoming believers. This wife is none other than the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:9-10).</P><P>God is now in His temple, and the voices of praise from the people are also in the temple. During the millennium the temple will gradually lose its place. There the overcomers will be kings in the city and priests in the temple. (Because there will still be sins, there will still be the need of priests.) But in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more temple.</P><P>Some within the church will attend the marriage feast (for example, the five wise virgins), and some will not be able to (for example, the five foolish virgins).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 19:8</H2><P>"And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</P><P>The wife is a symbol of the New Jerusalem. "And it was given to her" refers to her being rewarded. "Bright" means white and is in contrast to what the harlot wears in 17:4. "Clean" is the same word that is used in 19:14.</P><P>"The fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints." In the original text, the word for "righteousnesses" is the same as in Isaiah 64:6: "our righteousnesses."</P><P>"The saints." These saints are those who will live in the New Jerusalem. To be a bride is temporary, but to be a wife is from the beginning to the end. This is also the case with the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the Lamb's bride in the millennium and the Lamb's wife in the new heaven and new earth.</P><P>Christians must be divided into the saved believers and the overcoming believers because only the overcoming believers have a part in the new city in the millennium. However, in the new heaven and new earth, both the saved ones and the overcomers will have an equal share.</P><P>The "saints" in this book include not only the Christians but also the Jews.</P><P>The bride's garment is temporary; only the overcoming believers are related to the bride.</P><P>It seems that the marriage of the Lamb is the first time that the city gate is opened, to let the overcoming believers in. The five foolish virgins cannot get in at this time.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
