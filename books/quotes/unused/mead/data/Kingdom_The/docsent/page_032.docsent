   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THORNS AND THISTLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 3:18 mentions two other negative words thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus asked, "Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thorns and thistles came from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They did not exist before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's creation there were no thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the ground to grow thorns and thistles after the fall indicates that in the eyes of God all the children of Adam have become thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether you are the manager of a bank or the robber of a bank, a gambler in a casino or a preacher in a cathedral, your nature in the eyes of God consists of thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as the Lord Jesus did not call the Pharisees serpents in a light way, He also did not use the words thorns and thistles in a meaningless way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Jesus used the term serpent, He certainly had the serpent of Genesis 3 in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, when he used the words thorns and thistles, He was also referring to Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible tells us that the grape tree, the vine tree, is the Lord Jesus John 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we were regenerated, we became the branches of this vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Adam we were thorns and thistles; in Christ we are branches of the real vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God created man in His image and gave him His authority so that man could express Him and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, however, Satan entered into man, usurped him, and possessed man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan even saturated man's body with his poisonous element, making it the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Lord drew a line to preserve man's spirit, Satan has corrupted man's mind and possessed man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result is that man has become a serpentine being and also thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE KINGDOM OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A kingdom is the totality of a certain life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is no life, there is no kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, without the vegetable life it is impossible to have the vegetable kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not speak of the chair kingdom, the stone kingdom, or the brick kingdom, because these things have no life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a certain life exists, that life with its activities constitutes a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The human life constitutes the human kingdom, the vegetable life constitutes the vegetable kingdom, and the animal life, the animal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is life, there is a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan has the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When this satanic life comes into man, it becomes the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom is an outgrowth of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There must be plant and animal families before there can be plant and animal kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There cannot be a kingdom without families.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, there are individuals; then the individuals are formed into families.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the families are put together collectively, they become a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Satan came into man, man became Satan's family with Satan as the father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus told the religious leaders that Satan was their father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First John 3:10 says that some people are the children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan is the father, and these people are his children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The family begins with the father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the family is enlarged, it becomes a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The satanic kingdom comes from the satanic family, and the satanic family comes from the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have you ever considered that the fallen human race has become Satan's family?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan is a father, and all of the fallen human beings are his children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan generated a family, and this family has been formed into a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be a part of the kingdom of Satan requires the life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you did not have the Devil's life, you could never be a child of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Don't think it is easy to be a child of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most Christians today simply neglect the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you rob a bank, you need a bank robber's life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not have the robbing life, you can never rob.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Can you teach or force a bird to bark?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how much a bird may try to bark, it cannot because it does not have the barking life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The same is true about lying.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To lie you need the lying life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is impossible to lie without the lying life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Chairs cannot lie because they have no life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, it is easy for human beings to lie because they have the lying life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Parents do not teach their children to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the contrary, they charge them not to tell lies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, they still lie.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not have to be taught to lie because they have the lying life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Where did this lying life come from?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It came from Satan, the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All men speak lies because they have Satan's life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We were initially Satan's family and eventually we became his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have used this illustration to convince you further that the kingdom is not merely a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is the totality of a certain life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The kingdom of God is simply the totality of God's life.</S>
