   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BUILDING UP THE CHARACTER OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD S SERVING ONES THE NEED TO BE STRICT IN THE FULL-TIME TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be strict in this term of the Full-Time Training.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For twenty years we have suffered damage because the training has not been strict enough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This time I hope that we would have a completely new and strict beginning in the training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Anyone who has ever served in the military knows that once a person joins the military, he loses all his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All his exercises and activities are directed by a single word of command.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is thoroughly changed from head to toe so that he may be freshly equipped to receive strict military training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without rigorous training, an army cannot fight a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No looseness is allowed, because the improper conduct of one person during a battle could lead to the destruction of the whole army.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I asked you to thoroughly study the three books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus before coming to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2 Timothy 2:3-4, Paul told Timothy, Suffer evil with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 clearly points out that the primary matter for a soldier is that he must not entangle himself with the affairs of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every contestant who runs on a racecourse does his best to dress as simply as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not want to bear any excess weight that can become an entanglement to him during the race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This makes it easier for him to finish the race and receive the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Similarly, in order to win a battle, a soldier must not allow himself to be entangled with the affairs and burdens of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since you have come to the training, you must hold the same kind of attitude as that of an athlete running on a racecourse and a soldier fighting on a battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not have this kind of spirit, I would urge you to go back to your job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the world, people can relax after completing their military service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, as good soldiers serving the Lord in the church, we have been enlisted not merely for two years of preparatory service but for a lifetime of service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, do not think that you can relax after graduating from two years of training.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Remember, you must be a good soldier for your entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From now on you must all have such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must make a determination before the Lord, saying, Lord, I am joining Your army to be a good soldier for my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Peter 4:1 says that we should arm ourselves with a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every soldier expects hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one serving as a soldier expects a life of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1953 we held a training in Taipei that was very strict at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, however, I was troubled, because in my view none of those who were in that training had become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The primary reason was that they failed to build up a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The work of the Lord s recovery in the Far East has been greatly frustrated mainly because of the Chinese character.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has been quite merciful in giving the Chinese people very intelligent minds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The whole world recognizes the intelligence of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, according to what I have observed in the United States over the years, the minds of the Jews are not necessarily sharper than those of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can deny, though, that the Jews are firm in their will and strong in their determination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the secret of their success.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once they decide on a matter, they will press on resolutely and will not give up until they reach their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the life-pulse that enables them to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Secondly, the Jews are very enterprising and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For much of the past two thousand years, the Jews were without a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was a suffering to them, and they wandered from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were rejected and persecuted by the entire world, especially during World War II when millions of them were massacred by Hitler.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, because of their diligence and endeavoring, they have reached the peak in their attainments in the United States and have become the focus of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Chinese people in America today are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason they are successful is because they are smart, enterprising, diligent, and determined.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though there are laws in the United States that protect minorities from discrimination, in actuality, minorities are not that protected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This compels the Chinese students who study in America to make even more of an effort to succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If it were not for this situation, it would be difficult for them to succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews are successful because of their determination and diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Chinese are smart but lack determination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those Chinese students who study abroad are successful because they are compelled to be determined and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, if they were to stay in their own country, they would readily become loose and lazy under the influence of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A major weakness of the Chinese character is that Chinese people do not strive to improve unless they are forced and pressed by the circumstances to improve.</S>
