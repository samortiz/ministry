<p class="bold">WEEK 4 — DAY 3</p><h2 class=head1>Matthew 5:20, 22</h2><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;For I say to you that unless your <sup>1</sup>righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means <sup>2</sup>enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">22 &nbsp;But <sup>1</sup>I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the <sup>2</sup>judgment. And whoever says to his brother, <sup>3</sup>Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, <sup>4</sup>Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>20<sup>1</sup> Righteousness here does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and are thus justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26); it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is obtained…by the complementing of the old law through the fulfilling of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given…here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (22:11-12), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-8) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.</p><p>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of letters, which they practiced by their own life according to the old law of letters; the surpassing righteousness of the kingdom people is the righteousness of life, which they live out by taking Christ as their life according to the new law of life.</p><p>20<sup>2</sup> Entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life (John 3:3, 5), but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration. To enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> The words…“I say to (or, tell) you” (vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44) are the new law of the kingdom, which complements the law of the old dispensation.</p><p>22<sup>2</sup> In this verse there are three kinds of judgments. The first is…at the gate of the city.…The second is…by the Sanhedrin,…a higher judgment. The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna [see note 228 in RcV] of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgments were mentioned here by the new King, who used figures from the Jewish background because His entire audience was Jewish. However, in regard to the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10, 12; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; and Heb. 10:27, 30. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord’s judgment, a judgment not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9).</p><p>22<sup>3</sup> I.e., stupid, good-for-nothing.

This expression is more serious than “Raca,” an expression of contempt.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 210-220; Hymns: #943</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
