We had the sensation that our sky was expanding. After being saved for some time though, perhaps some problems arose with our relatives or with the church or with some of the brothers and sisters. Immediately, our sky became somewhat cloudy again. It was not as cloudy and as dark as before we were saved, but still it was not clear. But as soon as we confessed our failures and applied His blood, condemning ourselves, our attitudes, our motives, and our intentions, right away the sky became clear once more. We came again under the clear sky. We must realize this is the open and expanding heaven to us. When we as the living creatures reach this point, we have absolutely nothing between us and God. We also have nothing cloudy between one another. There is nothing as a covering or separation between us. All the coverings, all the separations, all the clouds and fog are gone. We have a thoroughly clear sky. We have a sky that is fully expanded. Our expanse is as clear as crystal. When others look upon our clear sky, they will be astonished. It is terrible because it is so clear; it is crystal-clear and expanding.</P><P>Not only is the sky clear and expanding, but it is also stable. As a rule, the sky above the earth always has some movement. Either the clouds are moving or the wind is moving. But the sky above these living creatures is not moving. It is as stable as crystal. There is no change whatever with this sky. At the time we were saved, we enjoyed a clear sky, but only for a short time. Like the weather in Los Angeles, our skies fluctuated very much. Sometimes our sky became cloudy, but after we confessed our sins, it became clear again. This shows a real fluctuation in the sky above our head. But here, above these living creatures' heads, it is not like that. Here, the sky is like crystal, perfectly stable. There is no fluctuation in the weather. The heaven above all these living creatures is clear and expanding and stable. They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically, and they also have a clear fellowship between themselves, horizontally. They have a wide and stable span of fellowship.</P><P>Every proper local church must be like this. Unfortunately though, in some local churches, it seems the sky is cloudy and narrow. It is even difficult to stretch out two arms. The sky of that poor local church is so small. There is no expanse and it is dark and very touchy. Occasionally, in some local churches it is difficult to say anything because the situation is touchy. It is easy to offend some of the dear ones. If you say this, one will be unhappy with you. If you say that, another will be unhappy with you. You dare not say anything because the situation is too touchy. In a proper local church, there must be a broad sky. There must be a clear sky that is not so touchy. No matter what you say, people would not be offended. No one would lose his temper at you. This does not mean that we need to be broad-minded. If a frog is in a well, it means little as to whether he is broad-minded or narrow-minded. We need to jump out of the well and to get into the clear sky where the horizon is so broad. Do you think there is a possibility for any of the living creatures to be narrow-minded? It is impossible, because above their heads is the wide expanse. The sky above their heads is clear, expanding, and terrible to behold. Under such a sky we have the proper fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING A STRAIGHT COORDINATION</H2><P>Under a clear and expanding sky, we are enabled to have the adequate and proper coordination. Here the coordination is straight. In this chapter, the word straight is used twice. It is used once for the calf's hoofs, and it is used this time for the eagle's wings (1:23). Sometimes in the local churches, the coordination is not perfectly straight. Rather, it is slightly crooked. For example, one brother might fellowship a matter with Brother John and then tell him, "Please do not tell Brother Bill." Then he would go to Brother Bill and pass on some information and tell him, "Please do not tell Brother James." This kind of coordination is playing politics. We should never play politics. If I would say something to one brother, I must be able to say it to another. Our wings must be straight. Our coordination must be frank, sincere, earnest, and straight.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Visions of Ezekiel &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
