   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FULFILLMENT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT OF THE TYPOLOGY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY 3 Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16, 24-25; Rom 8:4-6; 1 Cor 6:17; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 1:10a; 22:17a; John 7:37-39</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this fellowship my burden is to turn us all to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit are entwined and mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE REVELATION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE The Spirit in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:1 says that God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 2 then says that the Spirit of God was brooding over the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later, after man had fallen to such an extent that he had become flesh, Genesis 6:3 says that the Spirit of Jehovah would not strive with man any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout the Old Testament the Spirit is referred to as either the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 the Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of God's holiness, but the divine title the Holy Spirit is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Consummation of the Spirit in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the beginning of the New Testament, when Christ was to be conceived and born, the Holy Spirit is mentioned for the first time Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's conception and Christ's birth were altogether by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the Holy Spirit is strongly stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ was conceived of this Spirit, and He was born through this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth and ministering for God, Matthew 12:28 tells us that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the Spirit was with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, John 7:37-39 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Spirit was with the Lord Jesus in His living and working on the earth, John 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord lived on the earth for thirty years; then He ministered for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was born of the Spirit, and He worked through the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in John 7, near the end of His three-and-a-half-year ministry, He called the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink, and He said that they would have rivers of living water flowing out of their innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostle John said that the Lord spoke here concerning the Spirit not the Spirit of God nor the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit whom the believers were about to receive; "for," John wrote, "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit of God was there in Genesis 1, and the Holy Spirit was there in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why, near the end of the Lord's ministry on this earth, did John tell us that the Spirit whom the believers were about to receive "was not yet"?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before us, Andrew Murray saw that the Holy Spirit of God is something particular, yet the Spirit is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In his masterpiece The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled "The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus," Andrew Murray wrote that "the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Andrew Murray, this Spirit, who is the Spirit in John 7:39, is something more than the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the holiness of God, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God had not been consummated wholly; that is, He had not been completed in full.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit was not consummated until the glorification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Luke 24:26 the glorification of Christ was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ entered into resurrection, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His divine nature with the divine life in Him was released.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's glorification was like the blossoming of a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a flower blossoms, it is glorified; all the contents of its life and nature are released and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The contents of Jesus Christ are just God with His holy nature and holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before His death and resurrection these contents were concealed in the shell of Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once during the three and a half years of His ministry, on the Mount of Transfiguration, three of Christ's disciples saw Him transformed, or transfigured, before their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of a sudden His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as light Matt 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was His glorification, but it lasted only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He entered into resurrection, He was wholly glorified by releasing God with God's nature and God's life from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Until that time the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was at that time that the Spirit was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that "the last Adam that is, Christ became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit, produced through and in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By passing through all the processes incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the all-releasing resurrection the Triune God, the God in the Divine Trinity, was consummated as one Spirit, that is, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This life-giving Spirit is the totality of the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the clear revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That man was Jesus Christ, who is the God-man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was God, but one day He put on man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, He became both divine and human, having put the flesh upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He was crucified, He brought this man, that is, His humanity, to the cross and died there to terminate humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then He resurrected to bring His humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through this resurrection His humanity was made divine Rom 1:4 , and He was born to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such a One, in His resurrection and with His resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the divine revelation in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the Nicene Creed, issued at the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, stresses the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ and also includes the Spirit, the Nicene Creed does not say anything concerning Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the Nicene Creed is good but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many major denominations and the Catholic Church still accept this creed as their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, they do not pay adequate attention to John 7:39 or 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In my study of the Bible I read John 7:39 many times and wondered why this verse says that "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I also considered very much the significance of the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was not until 1954, while I was working for the Lord in Taipei and Manila, that I received a full revelation of what I am now passing on to you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In that year in a summer training in Hong Kong I released this matter, telling the saints that today our Triune God is the consummated God, not the original God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The original God was merely divine; but after passing through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, this Triune God has been processed and consummated in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
