   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Distinct but Inseparable</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based on the revelation of the Bible, Bible teachers throughout the centuries have used the noun Trinity and the adjective Triune .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since human language is based on human culture, if there is no culture, words will not be produced to match it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, two hundred years ago there was no telephone; thus, the word telephone did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the invention of the telephone, a word was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In recent years the culture of computers has pervaded society, and as a result, many terms associated with computers were created to express and transmit this culture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, much progress has been made in studying the truths in the Bible; therefore, there is a need to create new terms to express these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Bible shows that God is one; on the other hand, the Bible shows the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit three persons?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is truly not easy to explain, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we separate Them, we have three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the teaching of tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 9:6 says, A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; /...His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The child who was born to us is the Mighty God, and the Son who was given to us is the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ the Son, who passed through death and resurrection, is the last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 3:17 also says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By putting these verses together, we see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God Being One but</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having the Aspect of Being Three</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people overstress the aspect of God being three and deny the aspect of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit being one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, they fall into the error of tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Orthodox theologians have seen that God is one and yet has the aspect of being three.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, they invented the term Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Trinity is a mystery which no one can clearly explain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bible scholars and theologians over the centuries all agree that God is one, but there is indeed the aspect of His being three.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although they have spent a great deal of time to study the Trinity, they cannot clearly differentiate between His being one and His being three, but they all admit that God is one yet three.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The three of the Triune God are distinct but inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, but on the other hand, the Son is the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit; the three are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus said, I am in the Father and the Father is in Me John 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also said, I and the Father are one 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the Son and the Father are one, there is still a distinction of I and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a distinction between the Father and the Son, but we cannot separate the two, because the two are one and cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How are the Father and the Son distinct?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And to what extent are They distinct?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to explain clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Orthodox theologians only say that God is three and yet one, and that there is a distinction between the three.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we say that there is no distinction between the three, we will fall into the error of modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God Being One Essentially in His Existence and Being Three Economically for His Move</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With regard to the essential aspect of the Triune God, He is revealed as one, and with regard to the economical aspect, He is revealed as three.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Economically, the Father and the Son are distinct, but essentially, the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The essential aspect refers to His existence, whereas the economical aspect refers to His move.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Based on the verses that we quoted from the Scriptures, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son is the Father, and the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In essence the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Tritheists stress the aspect of God being three but neglect the aspect of God being one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They quote verses such as Matthew 3:16-17 and John 17:1 to prove that the Father and the Son are distinct and separate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, these verses refer to the economical aspect of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are economically distinct but essentially one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the Lord s Day we break bread to remember the Lord, and we follow the Son to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are the Father, the Son, or the Spirit in us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The answer is that all three are in us, but the three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we worship the Father, we are following the Son, the firstborn Son of God, who is leading many sons to worship the Father; this is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we worship, there is a distinction between the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not a matter of essence; it is related to God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After we remember the Lord, we follow Him to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not with regard to the essential Trinity but with regard to His move in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In God s move there is a distinction between the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Son was crucified on the cross, because crucifixion is a move in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, according to His existence, the Son is not merely the Son; the Son is also the Father and the Spirit Col 1:19; 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Economically, the One who was crucified was the Son; essentially, however, the Triune God was crucified.</S>
