	 <h2 class="head3">The Spirit, Soul, and Body<br />
Being Thrown into the Lake of Fire&mdash;<br />
the Second Death</h2>
<p>The fourth aspect related to the suffering of death is that of the entire person&mdash;spirit and soul and body&mdash;being thrown into the lake of fire to suffer for eternity. This is what the Bible refers to as the second death. Man&rsquo;s spirit is dead, then his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades. These three aspects together comprise the first death. This first death is progressive, starting with death in the spirit, proceeding to death in the body, and culminating with the suffering of death in the soul and spirit in Hades. When the soul and spirit suffer in Hades, the process involving the first death is completed. Strictly speaking, after a person is born, he is not living every day but dying every day. Eventually, his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades, completing the first death. In the future the spirit and soul will come forth out of Hades, and his body will come out from the earth. The entire person of those who are not saved will be resurrected, pass through God&rsquo;s judgment, and then be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer the second death, which is to suffer in the lake of fire eternally. The suffering of this death is the ultimate suffering of death. The first death is a step-by-step process, but the second death, the death of the entire unsaved person, occurs and consummates at the time of judgment at the great white throne.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:15).</p>
<p>In the future all those who are not saved and whose names are not written in the book of life will be thrown into the lake of fire to perish for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:8).</p>
<p>All unforgiven sinners, no matter what their sin, will be thrown into the lake of fire. This is the portion that sinners will receive for sinning, and this is the second death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire and brimstone...and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever&rdquo;; &ldquo;He shall be tormented in fire and brimstone...forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:10; 14:10-11).</p>
<p>The unforgiven sinners who perish in the lake of fire will suffer day and night without rest forever and ever. The result of the first death, going to Hades, is temporary and the suffering of its flames less severe than that of the lake of fire. The result of the second death, being cast into the lake of fire, is eternal, and its eternal sufferings are indescribably severe.</p>
<p>Some people say that a person no longer exists and no longer has any feelings when he dies. But this is not the revelation of the Bible! The Bible shows that the soul and spirit of a dead unbeliever is full of a sense of suffering in the flames of Hades (Luke 16:23-28). Moreover, when his entire person&mdash;spirit and soul and body&mdash;is cast into the lake of fire, he will be tormented in fire and brimstone and have no rest day and night forever and ever (Rev. 14:10-11; 20:10, 15; 19:20; 21:8). When the Bible speaks of perishing (John 3:16), it does not mean the end of existence, because this same word is translated &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; in Matthew 9:17 and Mark 2:22, where the wineskins are ruined and lose their original usefulness. In Matthew 10:6 and 15:24 and in Luke 15:4, 32, and 19:10 this same word is also translated as &ldquo;lost,&rdquo; referring to the house of Israel, sheep, the prodigal son, and sinners. Although they are lost, they continue to exist.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Victory over Death<br />
Enjoyed by Believers in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ died for us&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:8).</p>
<p>Believers in Christ have conquered death, even though death is strong, has might, and its sufferings are numerous and terrible. However, death cannot harm or control the believers in Christ. Believers overcome death because Christ died for us. Therefore, death has no position in us and cannot harm or control us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;One died for all, therefore all died&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:14).</p>
<p>Christ died for us all. In God&rsquo;s eyes, we have already died in Christ. In Christ we have left death behind and conquered death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;By the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:9).</p>
<p>In His death Christ tasted death on our behalf. When Christ died on the cross, He tasted all the sufferings mentioned above on our behalf. Christ received the portion that we should have received. Christ drank the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath for us. Therefore, we no longer have to taste the suffering of death. We can leave death behind, having conquered it, because Christ tasted everything of death on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil, and might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14-15).</p>
<p>People fear death, and because they fear death, they are slaves to death and under its control. This is the result of the devil&rsquo;s exercising the might of death upon people. Christ, however, destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil, on the cross and released us who because of the fear of death were held in slavery to death and to the devil. The death of Christ released us from the might of death and enabled us to leave behind the authority of death and to conquer it.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:10).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil, and nullified death itself. Furthermore, He resurrected, bringing life and incorruption to light. Therefore, we not only leave death behind through His death-destroying death but also overcome death by His incorruptible life.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Has passed out of death into life...Those who hear will live&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24-25).</p>
<p>Christ died for us, tasted death on our behalf, destroyed him who has the might of death, and nullified death itself; therefore, once we hear the gospel and receive Him through believing, our spirit is enlivened, and we pass out of death into life. We escape death and enter life.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5; see also Col. 2:13).</p>
<p>Originally, we were dead in spirit because of our offenses, but when we received His life, God made us alive together with Christ through His Spirit. Our dead spirit was enlivened. Thus, in our spirit we can escape death and live before God.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 11:25-26).</p>
<p>The believers who are alive when the Lord returns have the possibility of never dying. But even if we do not live until He comes, we will be resurrected when He comes. Since He resolved all our problems with death, death can no longer control or hold us.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Those who...have fallen asleep through Jesus...will rise first&rdquo;; &ldquo;The dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed...Then the word which is written will come to pass, &lsquo;Death has been swallowed up unto victory&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;May be swallowed up by life&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:14, 16; 1 Cor. 15:52, 54; 2 Cor. 5:4).</p>
<p>Because we have received Christ, our spirits have been made alive with His life. Although our bodies are still under death, we will escape death completely when Christ returns, and we will fully enter into the life of Christ. The dead believers will be raised from the dead, and those who are living will be changed. All believers will escape death completely. Every aspect of death in a believer, from spirit to body, will be swallowed up by life. Then in Christ we will overcome death completely. Through Christ&rsquo;s first coming with our believing into Him, our spirit passed out of death into life. When He comes a second time, our body will pass out of death into life. By His two &ldquo;comings,&rdquo; we will completely escape death and overcome it.</p>
