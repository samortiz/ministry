<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE LORD'S WORD<br />BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 13, 1940, midweek<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: John 6:63; Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 2:15</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>I know that some of you who are sitting here tonight do not need my word, but I hope that I am not mistaken in my leading. I wish to say something more concerning the Lord's word.</p><p>Second Timothy 2:15 shows us that God's worker must cut straight the word of the truth. Today many people pay attention to different ways of cutting God's word. They are clear whether a passage applies to the Jews or to the Gentiles. They know whether a passage is for Christians or for sinners. It seems that most of this so-called cutting work involves ascertaining whether a certain passage applies to a certain group of people.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>However, something far more important is mentioned in Hebrews 4:12, yet this is merely doctrine to many people. They know what it says, but they have not actually seen it. This verse says that God's word is sharper than any two-edged sword. Have you ever experienced this? God's word divides the bones from the marrow, as well as the spirit from the soul. Do you know what this means? When a man asks whether something is of the flesh or of the Spirit, of God or of man, this indicates that this person does not have any light within him. If a man is living in the light, he will not ask such questions. A man is void of light because God's word has not divided his spirit from his soul. God's primary intention is not for us to divide His word, but for His word to divide us. We must be dealt with first. If we have not been dealt with, we cannot go too far. Whether a worker can render help to others depends on whether or not his spirit and soul are divided. Our spirit must be divided from our soul. Only after we have experienced such a dividing can we divide God's word.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVIDING GOD'S WORD</h2><p>God's word can be experienced in two different realms. The first is the realm of doctrine and theology. The second is the realm of spirit and life. It is not wrong to divide God's word, because Paul did tell us to divide or cut straight the word of God. However, much of the so-called dividing that we see today is not proper dividing, because the principle behind it is wrong. We must realize that the Bible is incomprehensible to the human mind. It cannot be understood by casual reading. God has no intention for man to fully understand His Word. If He wanted man to be fully clear, He could have written in explicit terms line by line. He did not write it in this way, but in the way described in Isaiah 28:10: "For his words are: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;/Line upon line, line upon line;/Here a little, there a little." Many times when we read the Bible, we categorize, put words together, and then draw conclusions. Actually, we are not even that clear about our own salvation. How then can we possibly understand God's Word? God's Word is revealed to us a little here and a little there. Sometimes the words even seem contradictory. Take for example the truth of justification by faith. If it were up to us, we would have asked Paul and James to sit down together and work out a consensus before writing their Epistles. The same is true of the truth concerning holiness; many people have debated this truth and have ended up in quite an unholy condition. Many people misunderstand God's Word, yet God allows His Word to remain misunderstood. Many people dare not say the things that John, Peter, and Paul said because they are afraid of being misunderstood. Without some kind of categorization, it is true that God's Word can easily lead to misunderstanding.</p><p>Hebrews 6:10 says, "For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name in having ministered to the saints and in ministering still." The Lord does not clearly explain what this refers to. If I had written this verse, I would surely have explained what it referred to. All Scripture is God-breathed. Since He has chosen not to explain things as clearly to us as we would like, why should we be His counselor? Romans 11:33-34 says, "O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and untraceable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become His counselor?"</p><p>Many passages in the Bible cannot be put together. Even though the theologians try to put them together, they cannot do it satisfactorily. Do we know what salvation, justification, and sanctification are? Can we really know God's Word? Thank God that although God's Word is beyond our full understanding, it becomes clear to us in our experience. If someone asks you whether you are a son of God, you may not be able to explain or write about it, but deep within, you are very clear about what you know. Others may ask whether you are saved or justified, and you may not be able to articulate it in an outward way, but inwardly you know. You may not have the doctrinal knowledge, but you know that you are a son of God and that you are saved.</p><p>Our knowledge of God's Word does not come through our categorization of His Word, but of His Word taking control of us from within. This is the way to know the Bible. God's Word can only be understood in a spiritual way, in the way of life. His Word cannot be understood in the flesh or the mind. If we do not understand God's Word in the way of spirit and life, we are on the wrong track. We can take the way of the theologians or Bible expositors, but this is not the way of life.</p>
