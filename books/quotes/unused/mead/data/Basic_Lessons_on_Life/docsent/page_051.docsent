   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now that we have seen something concerning the fellowship of life, we want to go on to see the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We saw in the previous message that the fellowship of life is realized by the sense of life and that the sense of life preserves the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 2 of Romans 8 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life and verse 11 of the Spirit who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we have to read Ephesians 4:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 18 there is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unbelievers are alienated from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then verse 19 says that they are "past feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 8:10 says that in the new testament God writes His laws within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then 1 John 2:27 speaks concerning the anointing that teaches the believers concerning all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 15:4-5 speaks of our mutual abiding with the Lord, and Philippians 2:13 speaks of God operating within us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are some of the most precious verses in the New Testament, and they all have something to do with the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, in the whole New Testament you cannot find a verse that directly uses the term the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the sense of life is thoroughly implied and referred to in all the above verses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE MEANING OF THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, we need to see the meaning, the definition, of the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. The Feeling of Death</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Weakness, Emptiness, Uneasiness, Restlessness, Depression, Dryness, Darkness, Pain, Etc.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>on the Negative Side</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sense of life on the negative side is the feeling of death, a kind of negative feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is definitely revealed in Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to realize Romans 8:6 is altogether a verse of sensation because it says the mind set on the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not only a fact, but it is also a matter of feeling, a matter of consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you set your mind on the flesh, you have the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You feel that death is there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The feeling of death is the inner feeling of weakness, emptiness, uneasiness, restlessness, depression, dryness, darkness, pain, etc. on the negative side Rom 8:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you sense that you are weak, empty, uneasy, restless, depressed, dried up, darkened, and in pain within, this indicates that death is there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When death is here, this means that you have set your mind on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To set the mind on the flesh simply means to live in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mind is the key of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The key opens the gate for us to walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To set the mind on the flesh simply means to open the gate of the flesh and to walk the fleshly way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, when you sense death is here, you have to realize that you are living, walking, in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the negative function of the sense of life.</S>
