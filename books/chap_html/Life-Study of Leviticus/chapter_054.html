<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE FESTIVALS</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 23:23-44</h1><p>After living on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the fulfillment and reality of the type of the Passover. By His death on the cross He accomplished redemption and terminated all the negative things in the universe. The outcome of such a death was resurrection with the issue of the divine life, which is the reality of the consummated Triune God to be our portion. In Christ’s resurrection we all have a portion in this consummated Triune God.<p>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. In His ascension He poured out Himself as the consummation of the processed Triune God in the form of the economical Spirit.<p>Although our God is eternally perfect. He still needed a consummation. Before His incarnation, He was merely God without a consummation. But as the result of the processes through which He passed, He has been consummated. The consummation of the processed Triune God is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit. As such a consummation. He poured out Himself upon us, making us a part of His enlargement. This is the significance of Pentecost.<p>Pentecost is the issue of Christ’s resurrection, and His resurrection is the issue of His all-inclusive death. All this has become a wonderful feast for God and for us.<p>The ultimate issue of the processed Triune God is Pentecost. By the time we come to the feast of Pentecost, all the negative things have been cleared away, and all the positive things have been released. The processed Triune God as the consummated One has been poured upon us to bring us into Himself so that we may be His extension, enlargement, increase, and expansion. Now we are Christ’s Body, and in this Body we have the mingling of the consummated, processed Triune God with the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite man. The entire universe is for this, and it will remain forever. Eventually, it will become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the complete, eternal testimony of the consummated Triune God with His redeemed ones.<p>Having covered the first four feasts, we shall go on in this message to cover the last three—the feast of the blowing of trumpets, the feast of propitiation, and the feast of tabernacles.<p>The first group of four feasts took place in the first half of the year. The second group of three feasts took place in the second half of the year. The first four feasts point to the past and to the present. These feasts have been fulfilled in Christ, yet we are still experiencing and enjoying them. We are enjoying the feast of Passover, and we are still in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first-fruits. Furthermore, we are still in the feast of Pentecost, which is actually a feast of the church.<p>The second group of feasts points to the future, to the coming days, to the time of the Lord’s coming back. When the Lord Jesus comes back, these three feasts will be fulfilled.<h2 class=head3>5. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets</h2><p>Leviticus 23:23-25 tells us of the feast of the blowing of trumpets. This feast signifies God’s calling together of His scattered people (the dispersed Israelites) and His reminding them that He will issue such a call to them (Matt. 24:31; cf. Isa. 27:13; Psa. 81:3).
