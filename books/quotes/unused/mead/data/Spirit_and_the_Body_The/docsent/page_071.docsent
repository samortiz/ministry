   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR ALL TO FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not say that you are not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To say, "I am not of the Body," means that you feel you do not need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the foot to say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," means that the foot has no need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this portion of the Word, not to be of the Body means not to function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of us, perhaps eight out of ten, are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many think that because they are not talented or gifted, they do not need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that they consider themselves not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As many sit in the meetings, they have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may deny it, but deep within they say, "I am not an elder, so I don't need to do anything in the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although you may not be as gifted as the elders, you are still a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot say that you are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are not a hand, at least you are a little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, you must be of the Body, that is, you must function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come to the meetings, we should be like basketball players.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when certain saints come, they come not as players, but as spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who behave like spectators feel that they are not of the team, not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But all of us are on the team.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when we come to the meetings, we must come as players expecting to play in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be adjusted in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of the sisters may say, "I am not that smart or gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for me to function."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems that these sisters are not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are of the Body, but considering themselves inferior to others, they do not function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They say, "I am just a poor foot.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one pays attention to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are the eyes or the hands may go ahead and make a show.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I prefer to stay aside."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how inferior you may seem to be when compared to others, you must still be proud of what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The foot should say, "I may sometimes give off an unpleasant odor, but if I don't walk, the body has no way to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I don't touch the earth, how can the body touch the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am proud of being a foot."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, the ear needs to say, "I am proud of being an ear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I don't hear, the body cannot hear."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Members like the feet and the ears must learn to be proud and uplift themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the religious ones may be troubled to hear that some of the members of the Body need to be proud, this is nonetheless quite necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if the members become too proud, they will then need to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE BODY TEMPERED TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 24 Paul says, "God hath tempered the body together."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word "tempered" in this verse is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes the Lord will allow you to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you are too proud, He will humble you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To temper something is firstly to heat it up and then to cool it down, as a blacksmith does when making an iron fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to make the steel stronger, he first heats the metal and then puts it into cold water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise God has tempered the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are not able to help people to be proud, you are not a good minister.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I encourage you all to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Say, "Praise the Lord that I am a wonderful foot!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after I have helped you to become proud, I shall put you into cold water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some religious pastors always tell people to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But so many of you despise yourselves and are in bondage to your self-made humility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I want to dig you out of your graves of humility and help you soar in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would like to teach you to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, after soaring in the air for a while, you will need to be put into a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not pleasant, but it is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not say that because you are not a hand, but a foot, you are not of the Body and do not need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must be proud of what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not despise yourself or nourish any self-made humility.</S>
