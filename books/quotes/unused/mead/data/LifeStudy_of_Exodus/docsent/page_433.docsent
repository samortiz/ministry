   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD WROUGHT INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we can give a definition of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Holiness is God wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that holiness refers to the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, holiness is a matter of having the divine nature wrought into our being to make us divine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we become divine in this way, we are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God alone is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything else is common.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since only God is holy, for us to become holy requires that God be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, holiness is the Triune God wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HOLINESS IN DIVINITY,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RIGHTEOUSNESS IN HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have pointed out that the concluding word regarding the priestly garments in Exodus is related to holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The plate of pure gold on the turban worn by the high priest was inscribed with the words Holy unto Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This declaration, this brand, was on the forehead of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was on the golden plate worn as a crown, a blossom, and therefore we may say that holiness was exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That holiness is exalted as a crown indicates that holiness in divinity is exalted for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the high priest was covered with linen with a linen turban, a linen tunic, a linen girdle, and linen breeches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This linen covering of the high priest signifies righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Righteousness, which is related to humanity, is expressed as beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Holiness in divinity is exalted as glory, and righteousness in humanity is expressed for beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, today holiness is our glory, and righteousness is our beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ABSOLUTE HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As our high priest, Christ is working to bring us all the way from the first stage of holiness to the fourth stage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God treasures this holiness, and Christ is guarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament God gave the good land, the holy land, to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He charged them to labor on the land in order to have the harvest, the holy produce.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God also required that the top portion of this produce be brought to His dwelling and offered to Him on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, from this top portion offered as a gift, God required that a certain part be separated absolutely for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Particular parts of the offerings were for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These were regarded not as sacrifices but as holy gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sin offering and the trespass offering were sacrifices, but the meal offering, the peace offering, and the burnt offering were gifts, holy gifts offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of these gifts offered to Him, God kept part for Himself, and the remainder was for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Exodus 28:38, the high priest was required to bear the iniquity of this part.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that if anyone who was not qualified partook of it, Aaron was held responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the high priest guarded the holiness that was in the fourth stage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God treasures the holiness that is absolutely for Himself, and Christ is working to safeguard it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The holy land is indeed holy, but it is not absolutely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, the produce of the holy land and the top portion of the produce were for God, but they were not for God in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only that part of the top portion that was set apart fully for God was absolutely for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because God treasures this, He charges Christ to guard and protect it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that Christ as the High Priest is safeguarding a portion of holiness for God s satisfaction.</S>
