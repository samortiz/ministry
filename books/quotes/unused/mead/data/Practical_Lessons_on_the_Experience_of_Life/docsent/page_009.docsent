   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Law of Life with the Power of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also have the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 8:10 and Romans 8:2 speak of the inner law, the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whereas a nature has a taste, a law is for regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have an inner regulation regulating us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By regeneration we have the three of the Triune God and the divine life, divine nature, and the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we have the divine life and nature, out from this life with this nature we have the inner law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With every kind of life with its nature there is a certain law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To eat mice is according to the law of the cat life, and to bark is according to the law of the dog life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, for an apple tree to bear apples is according to its law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An apple tree bears apples and a peach tree bears peaches because they have different lives with different laws.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within the life there is the regulating power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need to regulate an apple tree, saying, "Little tree, you must remember you are an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must bear apples, not peaches."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, there is no need to tell a dog, "You must remember you are a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don't forget to bark; that is a dog's duty."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In actuality, it is hard to stop a dog from barking because barking is according to its law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A law is not only a regulation but also a power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law of gravity, for example, is a power according to the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That a tree brings forth apples is not only according to its law; it is according to its power and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have a certain law, we have both a regulating and a power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, we Christians need our eyes to be opened to see these wonderful matters within us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine law of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need to throw something up and then worry how it will come down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we do something out of worry, the more we may hinder it from coming down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should keep silent and watch the power of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, we should keep silent and watch the inner law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not only a regulating factor; it is also a power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians think that one day power will come down upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not realize that they have the inner power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Like the atomic power in small atoms, the real and greatest power is the one within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Anointing as the Moving of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By regeneration we also have the anointing 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not only the ointment itself but the anointing as the action, the moving, of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The anointing is the moving of the Holy Spirit, or we may say, the moving of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is always something moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are regenerated, we immediately have God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, the eternal life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These seven are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God the Father is in God the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the very essence of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The divine life is nothing other than the Triune God, and the divine nature is something of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have the life, we have the nature; if we do not have the life, we do not have the nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot separate these two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The law of life comes from the life with the nature, and the anointing is the moving and acting of the Triune God in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the three of the Triune God are life to us with His nature, so we have the law of life and the anointing as something so living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are to know the things of life, we must be clear about these seven items.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, we will not be able to grow in life in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the early years of my Christian life I was not clear about these matters, so I was not happy at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since I have become clear about these seven items, I have been a happy Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I realize that I have God, Christ, and the Spirit in me, and I have the divine life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some men are great, having a high position, high education, and millions of dollars, but inwardly I am greater.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have God, and many of them do not, so they are poor, pitiful people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have Christ and the Spirit, and they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have the divine life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing, but they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All they have is dung, refuse, nothing of any worth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By regeneration the Triune God the Father in the Son as the Spirit has wrought Himself into us as our life with the divine nature, so we have a living law within us and the anointing of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, we need to be humble, but on the other hand, we should not look down on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that we are big persons, for all the spiritual riches with the fullness of the Godhead are in us.</S>
