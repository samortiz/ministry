<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Elders and Deacons</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Those Who Appoint Elders&mdash;<br />
the Apostles Who Submit<br />
to the Authority of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>To be an elder or deacon in the church is a matter of office. To have an office is altogether related to authority. A person fulfills his office in the church by life and gifts, not by authority. However, his being appointed to an office is a matter of authority. The source of authority is Christ, the Head of the church. The Head appoints apostles in the church, and apostles, by the authority given to them from the Head, appoint elders and deacons in all the local churches. Hence, the appointment of elders and deacons is carried out through the authority of the apostles. The authority of the apostles is so definite that if an elder sins and the church is not able to solve the problem, the church should bring the accusation against the sinning elder to an apostle (1 Tim. 5:19), in the same manner as if they were going to court. This is because the apostles have authority over the elders.</p>
<p>In many organizations in today&rsquo;s society, members have the right both to elect and to recall those responsible for the organization. In the church, however, the appointment of elders is not in the hands of the saints but in the hands of God or, we can say, in the hands of the apostles who were appointed by the Head. The apostles&rsquo; appointment of the elders is more than ninety percent based on life. Only a small portion is based on the elders&rsquo; functions, or gifts.</p>
<p>We need to see that the appointment of elders and deacons is a matter of authority. If a local church could elect or recall elders, it would not be a normal church; rather, there would be confusion and degradation in the church. I hope that when we consider the church, we will not bring in the secular thought. Secular governments, regardless of size, are either autocracies or democracies. In the church, however, there is neither autocracy nor democracy but theocracy. The government of the church is neither an autocracy, rule by a single person, nor a democracy, rule by the people. Regardless of whether there is autocracy or democracy, the source is the same. Both are from man.</p>
<p>The government of the church is of God and from God. An apostle is qualified to appoint elders because he submits to the authority of the Head. The safeguard for the apostles is to live in the Holy Spirit and before the Head. Whenever an apostle, who has been appointed by the Head, fails to live in the Holy Spirit or before the Head, he loses the safeguard. The church then falls into human hands. The safeguard of authority in the government of the church lies in the apostles&rsquo; living in the Holy Spirit and before the Head. In other words, if the apostles do not live in the Holy Spirit and before the Head, they should not appoint elders and deacons in the church.</p>
<p>I hope that those among us who take the lead in serving the Lord will be aware of this matter. If they do not live under the rule of the Holy Spirit and submit to the authority of the Head, they should not touch the eldership. If they touch this matter, the church will fall under the government of man and not be under God&rsquo;s government. The church should not be governed by man but by God. In order to avoid confusion, God has arranged a way to raise up some; that is, He has given apostles authority to appoint elders. If we consider this matter calmly, we will realize that God&rsquo;s way is excellent. This way requires the church to be spiritual, and it also requires that those in the church, including the apostles, elders, and deacons, be spiritual. If the saints are not spiritual, they will not fear God or submit to the authority of the Head, nor will they receive the elders and deacons.</p>
<p>If an apostle does not live in the Holy Spirit or before the Head, he loses his position to appoint elders. If he does things according to his own will and acts on his own accord, even though he may continue to serve, he does not have the authority to appoint elders. The authority to appoint elders is with the Holy Spirit. Only when an apostle lives in the Holy Spirit and submits to the authority of the Head can he receive authority from the Head. Only then can he exercise authority to appoint elders. God used the prophet Samuel to anoint kings, because Samuel was such a prophet. It is not sufficient to be merely a prophet. To anoint a king, a prophet must be like Samuel. Eli could not anoint a king because he had lost God&rsquo;s presence (1 Sam. 2:27-36). Hence, not everyone who was called a prophet could establish the kingship. In order to be qualified to anoint someone as king, a prophet had to be like Samuel; that is, he had to live under God&rsquo;s authority and receive God&rsquo;s command. In the same way, to be qualified to appoint elders, an apostle must be one who lives under the authority of God, is ruled by the Holy Spirit, and receives the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>The appointing of elders in a local church is a crucial matter. It matters a great deal whether or not a person is in the Holy Spirit or outside of the Holy Spirit. There is not a rule or principle that states, &ldquo;It is the serving ones who appoint elders, and since some of the serving ones are apostles, they should appoint elders.&rdquo; Rather, it is the authority of the Head that appoints elders. Strictly speaking, it is not the apostles, but the authority of the Holy Spirit that appoints elders. When an apostle is about to appoint an elder, he must first ask himself whether he has the authority of the Holy Spirit and whether he is submitting to the authority of the Holy Spirit. This is a very important question. I am afraid that in some local churches, the appointment of the elders is not carried out under the authority of the Holy Spirit but according to rules and principles. If this is the case, there will not be the confirmation of the anointing in the appointment. Therefore, the appointing one must live in the Spirit.</p>
