   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was a real insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>David's great sin nearly annulled all his attainments from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>E. Pretending to Cover His Evil Deed</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After committing a willful act of adultery, David pretended to cover his evil deed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>6-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, God exposed him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>F. Murdering Uriah, His Faithful Servant,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>by a Conspiracy with Joab</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>David murdered Uriah, his faithful servant, by a conspiracy with Joab vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>14-25 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Hardest Battle and Withdrawing from Him</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a letter, David instructed Joab to put Uriah in the forefront of the hardest battle and then withdraw from him so he might be stricken down to death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By giving such a word to Joab concerning Uriah, David abused his kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joab did what David commanded, and Uriah was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even at the Sacrifice of the Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>of Some of the Servants of David</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only was Uriah slain, but also "some of the people, some of the servants of David, fell" v. 17b . This indicates that David murdered Uriah even at the sacrifice of the life of some of the servants of David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Comforting and Encouraging Joab</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joab surely realized that he was involved in a conspiracy to carry out a great sin, and his conscience must have condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David comforted and encouraged Joab, the one who carried out the conspiracy, by saying, "Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strengthen your fighting against the city and overthrow it" v. 25 . What a terrible thing for David to say! Uriah was not merely devoured by the sword he was actually murdered by David so that he could take Uriah's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>David's behavior here was utterly different from that of Joseph and Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph was tempted, but he ran and escaped from adultery Gen 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Boaz, David's forefather, also kept himself clean from the indulgence of the flesh of sin Ruth 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This purity kept Boaz in the line of the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David, however, willingly committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By his one sin David broke the last five of the Ten Commandments Exo 20:13-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second Samuel 5:13 says that he took more concubines and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>David was perfect in every way, but he was weak in the matter of the indulgence of the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The lust of the flesh is like a wild horse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To subdue this lust, we must hold the bridle very tightly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this matter David was loose, and he sacrificed his high attainment in the pursuit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>David was a great "diamond," but his indulgence in lust was a black, foreign particle in this diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though he was a person of high attainment in his spiritual pursuit, he was still able to commit such a great sin.</S>
