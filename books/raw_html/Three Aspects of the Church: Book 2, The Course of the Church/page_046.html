	 <h2 class="head2">The Gospel</h2>
<p>Another great recovery, which we should not neglect, is the recovery of the gospel. In England C. H. Spurgeon was called the king of preachers, and in America D. L. Moody was called the king of evangelists. The two were famous preachers of the gospel in the nineteenth century. They brought many people to salvation, and their gospel influenced many people. Just prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the missionaries who went to China were saved through the preaching of Moody and Spurgeon. Very few people have spread the gospel as much as these two men.</p>
<p>The move to take the gospel abroad came next. Foreign missions peaked at the end of the nineteenth century. The gospel went out to the entire globe, following developments in world politics, military affairs, commerce, and culture. Western missionaries preached the gospel all over the world&mdash;in Africa, South America, China, Japan, India, and even in the remote islands of the Pacific Ocean; furthermore, a great deal of money followed these missionaries from Europe and America to the places to which they were sent. This gospel work was prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. On the one hand, God was working in His church, and on the other hand, the environment was ready. These things were under God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>The gospel in Europe and America was a great recovery, as was the foreign missionary work. However, in the foreign missionary work there were both good things and complicated things. There were all kinds of people with all kinds of backgrounds. For example, the China Inland Mission was good, but not all of its missionaries were very spiritual. When I was serving the Lord in China and had some knowledge of Him, I was able to observe some missionaries from the China Inland Mission. I discovered certain situations that were not acceptable. Some of the missionaries did things in the way of mixture. For example, one of them, who taught theology and wrote a Greek dictionary for the New Testament, eventually became his country&rsquo;s ambassador to China. This was unquestionably good for diplomatic relations, but was spiritually very poor. This is evidence of the confusion and corruption among the missionaries.</p>
<p>There were even non-believers who went out preaching as missionaries. One of my history teachers was an atheist, but he also stood in the pulpit to preach. Therefore, the situation was very confused. The spread of the gospel abroad was a great recovery, but within that recovery there were many corrupt situations that cause one&rsquo;s heart to ache. Many good universities in China were founded by mission boards, such as Yenching University in Peking, Huchiang University in Shanghai, and Tungwu University in Soochow, Kiangsu Province. In addition, the missions founded many hospitals; however, this proves that their work was quite complicated and transmuted.</p>
<p>As a result of these recoveries related to the gospel, there were churches in many places. However, when good things come, bad things follow; when genuine things come, false things follow. In China the people, the work, and the truths were both good and bad, a mixture of a little of everything. However, we still praise the Lord that because of these recoveries, the gospel was preached in our homeland, producing the church throughout China and resulting in our salvation.</p>
<p>If we were to make a list of every recovery from justification by faith up until the present, I believe we would find that almost all the truths in the Bible have been recovered. Although they are not all complete, they are still substantially recovered. Therefore, while we cannot say that everything has been recovered, we can say that almost everything has been recovered.</p>
