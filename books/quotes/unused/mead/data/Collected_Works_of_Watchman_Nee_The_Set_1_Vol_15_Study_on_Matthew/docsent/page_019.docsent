   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 13 tells us that since we stand for the kingdom of God and truly want to keep the teachings on the mount, we should ask God to deliver us from the hand of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "for" indicates that this sentence follows the preceding passage and is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We pray this and that because the kingdom, the power, and the glory all belong to God and not to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Kingdom" is the sphere in which God rules, "power" is the operation of God, and "glory" is the effulgence of God, which shines out from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 16-18: This section is on fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 Fasting is an expression of self-humbling before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 Fasting is an expression of self-buffeting before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3 Fasting is an indication of one's seeking for God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, fasting should not be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we should do our best not to let others know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a matter of our purpose, intention, and motive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The "repaying," as above, is the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 19-34: This section is on treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Treasures include not only money but also clothing, food, and things precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 19: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word for rust means "eating" and is the same word as for "eating" in Romans 14:17.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, rust may be literally translated "eating," meaning "consumed" or "finished."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The consuming by moth refers to clothing, the consuming by rust or "eating" refers to food, and the stealing by thieves refers to money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's command is: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this does not mean that we should use up our money and eat up our food every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To "store up" means that we are planning to have something to depend upon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 20: "But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything that can be consumed by moth and rust or stolen by thieves is displeasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God condemns idle treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not be wasteful, nor should we store up treasures on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To store up treasures in heaven is to give to the believers who are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is made very clear in Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we store up treasures in heaven, then in time of need we can go to God to make a withdrawal rather than beg.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such storing up of treasures is a changing of banks, from one on earth to one in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 21: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When our treasures are relocated to heaven, our heart will be relocated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to transport our heart to heaven by distributing our treasures to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our treasures must go first; then our heart will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 22: "The lamp of the body is the eye.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every member of our body functions on behalf of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, a person whose eyes are blind is a blind person, even though only his eyes are defective.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse tells us that our eyes should be single.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we have two eyes, our eyes can focus on only one object at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, we could not see clearly because there would be a seeing disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some believers want to store up all their treasures on earth, but they have no peace within them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet they are not able to store up all their treasures in heaven either.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, they try to store up a little on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This causes them to lose their spiritual eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord shows us here that we cannot make gains in both worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord was afraid that people might not understand what He said in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, He used the word in verse 22 to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our eyes are not single and our heart is divided between two places, we will not have light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To have light is to see clearly and to be able to make manifest Eph 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be full of light is to be filled with something that can make other things manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, light is the spiritual eyesight, the spiritual vision, the spiritual view that can see accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then one can see what is the way of the cross and what is a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 23: "If your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When our eyes are fixed on two objects and we have two desires in our heart, we no longer have spiritual eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like a blind man walking on a narrow, winding path with deep ravines on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How dangerous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 24: "No one can serve two masters....You cannot serve God and mammon."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord said, "No one can serve two masters," but the believers always seem to say that it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Like the strength of the other members of the body, the strength of love is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we overspend it on unimportant things, when the time comes for important things, we are without strength.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we spend our love on mammon, then when the time comes for us to spend our love on God, our love will have been exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our heart can be in only one place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The principle of mammon is contrary to the principle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Chinese idiom which says that the rich are unkind does not mean that the rich are cruel, but rather, that they are selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Verse 25: "Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here the Lord changed His tone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since the Lord commanded us not to store up treasures on earth in the preceding passage, we will no doubt have questions concerning our food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The previous passage says that the way to deal with idle money is to give alms.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The passage from verse 25 on speaks concerning the proper attitude toward our legitimate needs.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here the Lord mentioned food first, and then clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is because our need for food is greater than our need for clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The problem of food is more urgent and more difficult to solve than the problem of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Therefore" has a deep meaning here because the previous passage says that we should not serve mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not be anxious even for legitimate needs such as food and clothing, for this kind of anxiety can eventually cause us to serve mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Life in the original language is soul, the seat of cravings and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible in many places connects the soul with food; for example, the soul fainted because of the lack of food Psa 107:5 .</S>
