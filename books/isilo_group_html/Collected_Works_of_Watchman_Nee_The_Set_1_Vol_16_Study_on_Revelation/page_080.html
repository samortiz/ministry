The Materials of the Foundations of the Wall,<br>the Gates, and the Street<br>(Revelation 21:18-21)</H2><P>"And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eight, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass." </P><P>"And the city was pure gold, like clear glass." The gold here is transparent and is different from ordinary gold.</P><P>"And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone." The twelve precious stones have twelve colors. Some say that these colors are: (1)green, (2)blue, (3)blue, (4)green, (5)red, (6)red, (7)yellow, (8)sea green, (9)yellow, (10)golden green, (11)purple, and (12) purple.</P><P>The combination of these twelve colors is very beautiful. The blending of the eight colors from the fifth through the twelfth produces a rainbow appearance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 21:22</H2><P>"And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."</P><P>There is no temple in the new city. In the Old Testament times, only the temple was holy; no place outside of it was considered holy. At the time of the Lord Jesus, the temple was still on the earth. During the time of the church, there is a temple in heaven, but none on earth. In the millennium, however, there will be a temple in heaven as well as one on earth. In the new heaven and new earth there will be no temple since there will be no sin and, hence, no need to offer sacrifices. The entire new city is holy. In the ancient times, men fellowshipped with God through the temple. Here all who live in the city can fellowship with God directly, because He and the Lamb have become the center of the new city.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Revelation 21:23</H2><P>"And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb."</P><P>It says here that the new city does not need the sun or the moon to shine in it. It does not say, however, that there will be no sun or moon in the new heaven and new earth. The light of the sun and the moon may shine upon the city, but the city itself has no need of this, because the glory of God illumines it and its lamp is the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Revelation 21:24</H2><P>"And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it." </P><P>The nations will walk in the light of the city. All those who live in the city have a resurrected body, whereas all those who live on the new earth, that is, the nations, still have a body of flesh and blood. These are the people of the nations. At that time, there will be nations, but no tribes (no distinction of race), no tongues (no distinction of language), and no Jews. The nations are the people who will still be alive after the millennial kingdom but were not deceived by Satan.</P><P>The saved ones in the city include the believers, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, who are saved by the blood of the Lord (because the gates of the new city have the names of the twelve tribes and the foundations of its wall have the names of the twelve apostles).</P><P>Those in the city are sons (21:7) and kings (22:5). The ones who live on the new earth are the living people who have passed through the millennial kingdom. They are the peoples on the new earth (21:3).</P><P>"The kings of the earth" are those who rule the nations in eternity. They are a little greater among those of the nations, yet they are very different from the kings in the city. Our Lord is the King of kings, and we are these kings.</P><P>"Walk" implies travel. At the time of the millennium, the earthly Jerusalem will be the capital of the whole world. Once every few years, the Gentiles will come to it. In eternity the Gentiles will also travel to the New Jerusalem. Their travel will be guided by the light of the city; thus, they need no other guidance. (The light shall guide them in the same way that the star in Matthew 2:9 guided the magi from the east.) The city will have no need of the light of the earth, but the people on the earth will need the light of the city.</P><P>According to the Old Testament, the glory here is the best produce of all the earth. If we read Genesis 31:1, we will immediately understand that the glory there refers to riches, or to the best produce of the earth. Here they "bring their glory into it," which means that on the new earth, the kings of the earth will present the good things from their land as offerings to God and to the city (Esth. 1:4).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 80</div><br></body></html>
