<h1 class="title">The Purpose of God, the Gospel of God,<br />
and the High Peak of the Divine Revelation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:1, 3-4; 8:3, 28-29; 12:4-5; 16:1, 4-5, 16b, 25-27</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have the church, the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 1:9-11, 22-23; 3:11; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure; He created all things for His will so that He might fulfill His purpose&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; Rev. 4:11.</li>
	<li>According to His good pleasure, God made a purpose, a plan, in eternity and for eternity, and thus it is called the eternal purpose; this eternal plan was made in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and for Christ according to God&rsquo;s desire and pleasure&mdash;Eph. 1:9-11; 3:11.</li>
	<li>God Himself is the initiation, the origination, and the sphere of His eternal purpose, which nothing can overthrow, for which everything is working, and regarding which He did not take counsel with anyone&mdash;1:11.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a corporate man to express Him and represent Him&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:15; 4:24.</li>
	<li>In eternity past God purposed to gain a group of people to be the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of God the Father in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:9-10, 14, 16, 28-29; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li><em>His purpose</em> in Romans 8:28 refers to the purposeful determination in God&rsquo;s plan; this is God&rsquo;s purpose to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son&mdash;v. 29.</li>
	<li>God has saved us and called us according to His own purpose; God&rsquo;s purpose is His plan according to His will to put us into Christ and make us one with Christ to share His life and position so that we may be His testimony&mdash;2 Tim. 1:9; 1 Cor. 1:30; 6:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the totality of all the divine truths, the gospel of God includes the highest truth&mdash;the high peak of the divine revelation&mdash;that in Christ God became man in order that in Christ man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce and build up the organic Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 1:1, 3-4, 15; Eph. 1:13, 22-23; Col. 1:5, 18; 3:10-11, 15; Rev. 21:2, 9-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to the desire of His heart and His eternal purpose, God wants to make Himself man and to make man God so that God and man may be the same in life and nature&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5, 9, 11.</li>
	<li>The highest point of God&rsquo;s gospel is God becoming man so that man may become God in life, nature, and constitution for His corporate expression&mdash;John 1:12-14; 12:24; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>God became man through incarnation; man becomes God through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification&mdash;John 3:5-6; 1:12-13; Rom. 6:19, 22; 12:2; 8:29-30.</li>
	<li>It is only by God&rsquo;s becoming man to make man God that the Body of Christ can be produced and built up, that the bride can be prepared, and that the New Jerusalem can be consummated; this is the high peak of the vision given to us by God in the Holy Scriptures&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 19:7; 21:2, 9-10.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is a composition of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified people who have been made God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;vv. 2, 7, 9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On God&rsquo;s side, the Triune God has been incarnated in Christ to be a man&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 14:10-11.</li>
		<li>On our side, we are being constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and nature to be His corporate expression for eternity&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17; 4:4-6, 16; Rev. 21:9-10.</li>
		<li>This is the highest truth and the highest gospel&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The divine thought in Romans concerning the gospel of God is that God became man so that, in God&rsquo;s complete salvation, sinners may be redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified to become the sons of God, who are the same as God in life and nature, to be the members of the Body of Christ&mdash;8:3; 1:3-4; 3:24; 5:10; 8:14, 29-30; 12:2, 4-5; 16:25-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Romans we can see the high peak of the divine revelation: God became man (8:3) so that man may become God (1:3-4) for the producing and functioning of the Body of Christ (12:4-5) as the organism of the Triune God.</li>
	<li>Romans explains how the individual Christ becomes the corporate Christ and how we, who were once sinners and enemies of God, become parts of Christ and form His one Body&mdash;9:5; 8:3; 1:3-4; 3:23-25; 5:10, 18; 8:2, 11, 32; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and condemned sin in the flesh so that sinners&mdash;serpentine beings, children of the devil&mdash;could be reconciled to God and justified by Him in order to receive eternal life and thus become children of God&mdash;8:3, 16; 5:10; John 1:12-14; 3:14; 8:44; 1 John 3:1, 10.</li>
	<li>Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4.</li>
	<li>The firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, is the prototype for the production of the many sons, the many God-men, who, as members of the Body of Christ, are exactly the same as the firstborn Son in life, nature, and expression&mdash;8:14, 29; Heb. 1:6; 2:10-12.</li>
	<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to have Christ reproduced in millions of believers so that they may become the members of His Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>Through God&rsquo;s organic salvation carried out by the divine dispensing of the Triune God as life to the tripartite man, the children of God are growing in life to become sons of God led by the Spirit&mdash;5:10; 8:2, 6, 10-11, 14.</li>
	<li>The sons of God, the many brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, are the members of the Body of Christ&mdash;12:4-5.</li>
	<li>We are one Body in the organic union with Christ&mdash;vv. 4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is the top revelation of the Bible and the focal point of Romans&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; 1 Cor. 12:13, 27.</li>
		<li>The will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness, His expression&mdash;Rev. 4:11; Eph. 1:5, 9; Rom. 12:2, 4-5.</li>
		<li>We are one Body in Christ, having an organic union with Him; this union makes us one in life with Christ and with all the other members of His Body&mdash;vv. 4-5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Body is an organism produced and held together by the union in life that we have with Christ&mdash;John 15:1.</li>
			<li>The actuality of the Body is in our remaining in the organic union with Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The local churches are the practical expression of the Body of Christ, for the unique Body of Christ is expressed as local churches&mdash;16:1, 4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although the churches appear in different places, they are not separate, and although they are local, they are still part of the unique, universal Body of Christ&mdash;12:4-5; 16:16b.</li>
		<li>In Romans 16 we see that all the churches and all the saints live in the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ and that all the saints in all the churches are in the blending life of the entire Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 1-23.</li>
		<li>The key to living the Body life in the local churches is to walk according to the mingled spirit&mdash;the divine Spirit mingled with the regenerated human spirit as one spirit&mdash;8:4; 1 Cor. 6:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The mingled spirit is the unique organ for God to bring forth and build up the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 7:6; 8:16; 12:4-5.</li>
			<li>If we walk according to the mingled spirit, we will be sons of God in full, and as such sons, we will be living members of the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;8:14; 14:17.</li>

<h1 class="title">God in Romans</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:1, 15; 5:1-11; 11:36</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Romans reveals God in creation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is invisible, but the invisible things of God, such as His eternal power and divine characteristics, are clearly seen, being perceived by the things created by Him.</li>
	<li>Christ as the eternal, unlimited power of God operates the entire universe and holds the entire universe together&mdash;Rom. 1:19-20; Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:3; 11:3; Psa. 19:1-6.</li>
	<li>With such a solid revelation by the concrete creation of God, there is no excuse for man to say that there is no God or that he cannot apprehend God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in condemnation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>After creation, man fell and became sinful; this brought in God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;The wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 1:18; 2:2-3, 16; 1:32.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God&rdquo;&mdash;3:19.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one&rdquo;; &ldquo;there is none who seeks out God&rdquo;; &ldquo;there is none who does good; there is not so much as one&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 10-12.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&rdquo;&mdash;v. 23.</li>
	<li>The practical way for us to be restricted from evil and wickedness is for us to glorify God, thank God, worship God, and serve God&mdash;1:21, 25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in redemption:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s condemnation exposes man&rsquo;s need of salvation, and for the righteous God to save sinful man, redemption is needed.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Through the faith of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; God justified us &ldquo;freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;3:22, 24.</li>
	<li>On the cross Christ &ldquo;was delivered for our offenses&rdquo;&mdash;4:25.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in due time Christ died for the ungodly&rdquo;&mdash;5:8, 6.</li>
	<li>Through the redemption of Christ, God can save us from His wrath&mdash;v. 9; cf. Rev. 14:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in justification:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is just, and He cannot be unrighteous; the redeeming death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements for us sinners.</li>
	<li>The redemption of Christ affords God the righteous ground to justify those who believe in Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and God is bound by His righteousness to do so.</li>
	<li>This is &ldquo;with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness..., so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 3:26.</li>
	<li>Based upon Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God has justified us, and the resurrection of Christ is a proof of this&mdash;v. 24; 4:25.</li>
	<li>Through this, &ldquo;the righteousness of God has been manifested&rdquo; and &ldquo;is revealed in [the gospel] out of faith to faith&rdquo;&mdash;3:21; 1:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in reconciliation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were not only sinners but also enemies of God; while we were enemies, we &ldquo;were reconciled to God through the death of His Son,&rdquo; and through Christ &ldquo;we have now received the reconciliation&rdquo;&mdash;5:10-11.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s justification is based upon Christ&rsquo;s redemption and issues in His reconciliation along with the full enjoyment of God in Christ&mdash;vv. 1-11.</li>
	<li>Having been reconciled, &ldquo;much more we will be saved in His [Christ&rsquo;s] life,...and not only so, but also boasting [exulting and glorying] in God&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
	<li>We joy in God and enjoy God in all that He is to us&mdash;1:1, 15; 14:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in identification:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were born in Adam, but God has transferred us out of Adam into Christ and has identified us with Christ, making us one with Him, through baptism&mdash;5:19; 6:3.</li>
	<li>We &ldquo;have been baptized into Christ Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death [in baptism],&rdquo; and we are growing together with Him &ldquo;in the likeness of His resurrection,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;in newness of life&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 3-5.</li>
	<li>Now we have to reckon ourselves &ldquo;dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; to present ourselves &ldquo;to God as alive from the dead,&rdquo; and to present our members &ldquo;as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 11, 13, 19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in sanctification:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God has made us one with Christ so that we may be sanctified not only positionally but also dispositionally; identification, thus, issues in sanctification.</li>
	<li>We have been baptized into Christ, and Christ has come into us; now we are in Christ, and also Christ is in us for us to be sanctified&mdash;vv. 19, 22; 8:1, 10.</li>
	<li>Dispositional sanctification not only comes out of life but also results in life and brings more life to us so that we may enjoy the riches of the divine life&mdash;6:4, 22-23.</li>
	<li>In sanctification the Spirit of life is the Triune God in our spirit; the very God who created us, redeemed us, and justified us is now in us&mdash;8:2, 9-11, 16.</li>
	<li>From within our spirit He spreads Himself into every part of our inner being to make His home in us; hence, when we set our mind on the spirit, our mind is life, and even our mortal body is given life through His indwelling&mdash;vv. 2, 6, 10-11; Eph. 3:17.</li>
	<li>Thus, we are being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating and permeating our being with God&rsquo;s nature of holiness, His divine element&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in glorification:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God has foreknown us, predestinated us, called us, and justified us; He is now sanctifying us, and He will glorify us&mdash;8:28-30.</li>
	<li>For this, He has made us His children by regenerating us; He is now leading us as His sons to grow up unto maturity so that we may be His heirs, joint heirs with Christ, to inherit the full sonship; this is to be glorified with our body fully redeemed&mdash;vv. 16, 14, 17, 23.</li>
	<li>For this, the indwelling Spirit is interceding for us, and God causes all things to work together to conform us &ldquo;to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 26, 28-29.</li>
	<li>The present conformation to the image of God&rsquo;s Son is the preparation for our future glorification in His Son; God is now bringing us into glory so that we may participate in His divine glory with His firstborn Son in &ldquo;the freedom of the glory&rdquo;&mdash;v. 21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in His securing love:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is enjoyed by us in His love that secures our destiny&mdash;vv. 31-39.</li>
	<li>In justification He has made us partakers of His righteousness, in sanctification He is working His holiness into our being, and in glorification He will bring us into His glory; now His love is the security of all these items.</li>
	<li>He loves us, and we are on His heart; nothing can separate us from His eternal and unchanging love that is in the redeeming Christ, who lives forever and who is interceding for us.</li>
	<li>We are fully and eternally secured by God&rsquo;s eternal love in the unchanging Christ.</li>
	<li>Because of God&rsquo;s unchanging love for us, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than overcome and conquer through Him who loved us&mdash;v. 37.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in His selection:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It was God who selected us, not we who selected Him&mdash;John 15:16a; Rom. 9:11; 11:5.</li>
	<li>His selection is our destiny, which is of Him who calls and of His mercy and sovereignty to make us vessels of mercy to contain Him unto honor and glory&mdash;9:11, 15-16, 21, 23.</li>
	<li>His selection is also by the righteousness which is out of faith and through Christ, who accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;v. 30; 10:4.</li>
	<li>Since His selection of us is of grace and not out of works, it is irrevocable; in His selection we are destined to have a share, a portion, in Him&mdash;11:5-6, 29.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in the Body life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Eventually, God is glorified in the Body of Christ; we, as His many sons, are the many members of the Body of Christ, who is God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</li>
	<li>For this Body our body has to be presented as one corporate sacrifice to God for His service, our soul has to be transformed by the renewing of our mind so that we may be built together in coordination for the Body to function, and our spirit has to be burning so that we may serve Him in zeal&mdash;12:1-6, 11.</li>
	<li>For this Body a proper daily life is necessary, and this Body life is the kingdom of God on earth today&mdash;vv. 9-21; 14:17.</li>
	<li>In order to keep the oneness of this Body, we have to receive all the believers in Christ, whom God and Christ have received; hence, we have to be general in doctrinal concepts so that we may build up one another to please God and glorify God&mdash;vv. 1-6, 19, 18; 15:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals God in the church life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body of Christ is spiritual and universal; it has to be expressed practically in various localities as churches.</li>
	<li>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in His Body, and the Body of Christ is expressed in the churches.</li>
	<li>The local churches as the practical expression of the Body are spoken of as &ldquo;the church which is in Cenchrea,&rdquo; &ldquo;the churches of the Gentiles,&rdquo; the church in Prisca and Aquila&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;the churches of Christ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the whole church&rdquo;&mdash;16:1, 3-5, 16, 23.</li>
	<li>Between these churches there were the communication in love and the fellowship of concern among the saints for the sharing &ldquo;in the fullness of the blessing of Christ&rdquo; and for the crushing of Satan under their feet so that the grace of Christ could be dispensed to all the saints&mdash;15:25-29; 16:20.</li>
	<li>In Romans 15 and 16 God is called &ldquo;the God of endurance and encouragement,&rdquo; &ldquo;the God of hope,&rdquo; &ldquo;the God of peace,&rdquo; &ldquo;the eternal God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the only wise God&rdquo;; our God is rich in all these aspects, and the gospel in this book is the gospel of such a rich God, out from whom, through whom, and to whom are all things for His glory&mdash;15:5, 13; 16:20, 26-27; 11:36.</li>
	<li>Now to such a God, &ldquo;to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen&rdquo;&mdash;16:27.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Propitiation Place</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:24-25; Heb. 2:17; 9:5; 1 John 2:2; 4:10</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through the entire process of crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, God has set forth Christ as the propitiation place&mdash;Rom. 3:24-25; Acts 2:24, 32-36; Heb. 9:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Old Testament the propitiation place, the lid of the Ark as a type, was hidden in the Holy of Holies&mdash;Exo. 25:17-22.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament Christ as the reality of the propitiation place is openly set forth before all men&mdash;Rom. 3:24-25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Propitiation is to conciliate two parties and make them one&mdash;Heb. 2:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Propitiation is to appease the situation between us and God and to reconcile us to God by satisfying His righteous demands&mdash;Rom. 3:25; 1 John 2:2.</li>
	<li>This is to solve the problem between us and God&mdash;our sins&mdash;that kept us away from God&rsquo;s presence and hindered God from coming to us&mdash;4:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As sinners, we needed propitiation to appease our situation with God and to satisfy His demands&mdash;Rom. 3:23; Luke 18:13-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Propitiation involves two parties, one of whom has wronged the other, has become indebted to the other, and must act to satisfy the demands of the other.</li>
	<li>The tax collector in Luke 18:9-14 is an illustration of the need of propitiation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Standing at a distance, [he] would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&rdquo; (v. 13); this implies the need of a Redeemer and also the need of propitiation.</li>
		<li>Realizing how his sinfulness offended God, the tax collector asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiatory sacrifice for sins, that God might be merciful and gracious to him&mdash;vv. 13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is the One who makes propitiation to God for us, He is the propitiatory sacrifice, and He is also the propitiation place where God can meet with His redeemed people&mdash;Heb. 2:17; 9:5; 1 John 2:2; 4:10; Exo. 25:17; Rom. 3:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Hilaskomai</em> means &ldquo;to propitiate,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;to appease,&rdquo; to reconcile two parties by satisfying the demand of one upon the other&mdash;Heb. 2:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the cross Christ propitiated for us and brought us back to God.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins, thereby satisfying the demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness and appeasing the relationship between God and us, so that God may be peacefully gracious to us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>Hilasmos</em> means &ldquo;that which propitiates,&rdquo; that is, a propitiatory sacrifice&mdash;1 John 2:2; 4:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ Himself is the propitiation for our sins, the sacrifice for our propitiation before God.</li>
		<li>Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins, not only for our redemption but also for satisfying God&rsquo;s demands&mdash;Heb. 9:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>Hilasterion</em> denotes the place where propitiation is made&mdash;Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The propitiatory cover signifies Christ as the place where God speaks to His people in grace.</li>
		<li>The propitiatory cover equals the throne of grace, where we may receive mercy and find grace&mdash;4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The propitiatory cover is needed by both God and us for the Ark of the Testimony to become our experience and enjoyment&mdash;Exo. 25:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The propitiatory cover, the propitiation place, signifies that Christ is the shining of the divine glory and that God meets with us and speaks with us in this glory&mdash;Heb. 9:5; 1:3; Exo. 25:17-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The cherubim on the propitiatory cover are related to God&rsquo;s glory and signify His glory&mdash;Heb. 9:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The cherubim indicate that Christ expresses God&rsquo;s glory, that God&rsquo;s glory shines out from Him&mdash;1:3; Exo. 25:18-20.</li>
		<li>For God to meet with His people and speak to them from between the cherubim means that He meets with us and speaks to us in the midst of His glory; this glory is the shining of Christ&mdash;Num. 7:89; 2 Cor. 4:4, 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As typified by the propitiatory cover, the lid of the Ark, Christ is the shining and redeeming One as the place where the righteous, holy, and glorious God can meet with fallen sinners&mdash;Rom. 3:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christ who dwells in our spirit is the One portrayed by the Ark with the propitiatory cover&mdash;v. 25; 8:10; Col. 1:27; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		<li>The cherubim on the propitiatory cover signify Christ&rsquo;s shining in His divinity, and the blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover signifies His humanity for redeeming; as God, Christ shines in His divinity, and as man, Christ accomplished redemption in His humanity, signified by the blood&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Lev. 16:14-15.</li>
		<li>Because of Christ&rsquo;s divinity and humanity, we and God can meet together in the shining and redeeming Christ&mdash;Exo. 25:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because of the blood of redemption, we can now have fellowship with the righteous God in the glory of Christ&mdash;Lev. 16:14-15; Heb. 10:19; Rev. 22:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way to experience Christ as the propitiation place is through faith in His blood&mdash;Rom. 3:25.</li>
		<li>The effectiveness of the blood of the sacrifices is not mainly at the altar in the outer court but at the Ark in the Holy of Holies&mdash;Lev. 16:14-15.</li>
		<li>Because the blood has been sprinkled on the propitiatory cover and because God&rsquo;s standing is on the blood, He can meet with us in the midst of His shining glory&mdash;Exo. 25:22.</li>
		<li>When God comes to us and speaks to us in the glory of Christ, He does not see the requirements of His righteous law, and He does not see our sins; instead, He sees the redeeming blood on the propitiatory cover.</li>
		<li>Whenever we meet with God in glory, we have the sense deep within our spirit that we are washed by the blood; this is the propitiation place in our experience&mdash;1 John 1:7; Rev. 1:5; 7:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ as the propitiatory cover is the place where we are infused with God, hear His voice, learn the desire of His heart, and receive vision, revelation, and instruction for our daily life&mdash;Num. 7:89; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>As those who have obeyed the gospel of God concerning His Son and have believed into Him to have the obedience of faith, we have experienced the divine transfer&mdash;Rom. 10:16; 1:5; 5:12, 17, 19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As believers in Christ, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12, 17, 19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the sight of God there are only two men in the universe&mdash;Adam and Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In Adam we inherited sin, we were constituted sinners, we were under the reign of death, and we were under God&rsquo;s condemnation&mdash;vv. 12, 14, 19; 1:18.</li>
			<li>As the result of being in Christ, we have grace with righteousness, we have been justified, and we have eternal life&mdash;v. 17; 3:24, 26; 5:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We were transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing into Christ and by being baptized into Christ&mdash;John 3:15; Rom. 6:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When we believed in Christ, we actually believed ourselves into Him, and when we were baptized, we were baptized into Him.</li>
			<li>Because God has put us into Christ, we should boldly testify that we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we have been transferred out of death into life&mdash;John 5:24; 1 John 3:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The source of death is the tree of knowledge, and the source of life is the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 17); hence, to pass out of death into life is to change the source of our living.</li>
		<li>By repenting and believing into the Lord Jesus, we received the divine life into us and were transferred out of death into life&mdash;John 3:15; 5:24.</li>
		<li>Faith in the Lord Jesus is the way for us to pass out of death into life; love toward the brothers is the evidence that we have passed out of death into life&mdash;1 John 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we have been transferred out of darkness into light&mdash;Acts 26:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death; light is the expression and sphere of God in life&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>
		<li>God has transferred us out of Satan&rsquo;s death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light&mdash;1 John 1:5-7.</li>
		<li>Formerly, we were in darkness under the authority of Satan, but we have been transferred out of darkness and the authority of Satan into light and God&mdash;Acts 26:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we have been delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love&mdash;Col. 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the devil, who has the might of death; we have been delivered from the devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection&mdash;Heb. 2:14; John 17:15; Col. 2:15; John 5:24.</li>
		<li>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us and who rules us in His resurrection life with love and in light&mdash;Col. 1:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As believers in Christ, we have been transferred from law to grace&mdash;Rom. 6:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This grace is the Triune God processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be everything to us for our enjoyment&mdash;2 Cor. 8:9; 1 Pet. 5:10; Heb. 2:9.</li>
		<li>The grace into which we have been transferred is the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us&mdash;God Himself in Christ as the Spirit with all that He is for our enjoyment&mdash;John 1:14, 16-17; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The practical and experiential transfer is the transfer out of the flesh (the practical and experiential Adam) through our being crucified with Christ and into the Spirit (the practical and experiential Christ) through our union with the Spirit&mdash;Rom. 7:1-6; 8:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As believers in Christ who have experienced the divine transfer, we should now live a grafted life&mdash;a life in the union of the divine life with the human life and in the mingling of the divine Spirit with the regenerated human spirit&mdash;6:5; 11:17, 24; 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God desires that the divine life and the human life be joined together to become one life&mdash;John 15:1, 4-5.</li>
		<li>This oneness is a union in life&mdash;a grafted life&mdash;Rom. 11:17, 24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order for us to be grafted into Christ, He had to pass through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection&mdash;John 1:14; 3:14; 12:24; 20:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ became flesh to be the seed of David, the Shoot of David, so that we may be grafted together with Him&mdash;1:14; Matt. 1:1; Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15.</li>
		<li>Christ was &ldquo;cut&rdquo; on the cross so that we could be grafted into Him, and He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into us and make us one spirit with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a; Rom. 8:10; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Grafting produces an organic union&mdash;Rom. 6:5; Gal. 2:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is not the exchanging of a poor life for a better life; rather, it is the uniting of two lives as one so that they may share one mingled life and living&mdash;v. 20; 1 Cor. 6:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Such a mingling takes place when two similar yet different lives pass through death (cutting) and resurrection (growth).</li>
			<li>This depicts our union with Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li><em>Faith in Jesus Christ</em> (Gal. 2:16) refers to an organic union with Him through believing; in such an organic union we and Christ are one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>Grown together with Him</em> (Rom. 6:5) denotes an organic union in which growth takes place, so that one partakes of the life and characteristics of the other; in the organic union with Christ, whatever Christ passed through has become our history&mdash;v. 6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 2:5-6.</li>
	<li>Grafting discharges all our negative elements, resurrects our God-created faculties, uplifts and enriches our faculties, and saturates our entire being to transform us and conform us to the image of Christ&mdash;John 11:25; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 12:2; 8:29.</li>
	<li>Since we have been grafted into Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves but allow Christ to live in us&mdash;John 15:1, 4-5; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>Through grafting we are united with Christ, mingled with Him, and incorporated with Him to become the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5.</li>

<h1 class="title">Being Saved in Life and Reigning in Life for the Body Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10, 17, 21</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Through God&rsquo;s divine dispensing in us and His divine union with us, we can experience and enjoy the saving in Christ&rsquo;s life in God&rsquo;s full salvation, as conveyed to us in Romans, in the following aspects&mdash;5:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By the abundance of grace (God Himself) and of the gift of righteousness (Christ Himself) which we received, we are able to reign in Christ&rsquo;s divine life over sin, death, the old man, the flesh, Satan, the world, and all persons, matters, and things that do not submit to God&mdash;v. 17.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s holy nature sanctifies our worldly disposition; God sanctifies us dispositionally out of His divine life and unto His divine life that we may enjoy more of His divine life&mdash;6:19, 22; 15:16.</li>
	<li>The indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the automatic and spontaneous working of the Triune God as life in us, frees us from the law of sin and of death, the slavery and bondage of sin; the operation of this law comes out of God&rsquo;s divine life, and it also causes the increase of the divine life in us&mdash;8:2, 11.</li>
	<li>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s divine dispensing in our spirit, soul, and body causes these three parts to be saturated with the processed divine life, with the result that our entire being is completely united with the processed Triune God and mingled with Him as one&mdash;vv. 5-11.</li>
	<li>The renewing of our mind by the Spirit results in the transformation of our soul, which saves us from being conformed to the modern style of the world and issues in all the virtues and the overcoming, mentioned in chapters 12 through 16, as our daily life, a life of the highest standard, and as our church life, a life that is all-overcoming&mdash;12:2.</li>
	<li>By the renewing of our mind and the transformation of our soul, we become members one of another with all believers in the Body of Christ and are built up together as the Body of Christ and thereby have the service of the Body; this is the crystallization of our experience of the saving in Christ&rsquo;s life&mdash;vv. 1, 3-8.</li>
	<li>Based on the revelation and teaching in chapters 14 through 16, we live the life of the local church in different localities as the appearance of the Body of Christ, the universal church, in different localities.</li>
	<li>By becoming the built-up church, a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail, in different localities, we afford God the opportunity to crush Satan under our feet that we may enjoy Christ as our rich grace and the God of peace as our surpassing peace&mdash;16:20.</li>
	<li>In our experience of the various aspects of the saving in the divine life, as mentioned above, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God through the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; arranged under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, so that we have His divine attributes and His human virtues and thereby express the glory and beauty of Him, the God-man&mdash;8:28-29.</li>
	<li>In the process of our experience of the saving in the divine life, the splendor of the divine life gradually saturates us until it saturates our body, issuing in the redemption of our body, that our spirit, soul, and body may all enter into the glory of God; this glorification is the peak attained in us by the saving in the divine life, and it is the climax of God&rsquo;s full salvation&mdash;vv. 23, 30, 17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals that the believers need to reign in life with grace over all things for the Body life&mdash;5:10, 17, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s complete salvation is for us to reign in life by the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The gift of righteousness is for God&rsquo;s judicial redemption; grace is for us to experience God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</li>
		<li>Reigning in life is the full experience of the organic salvation of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We have been regenerated with a divine, spiritual, heavenly, kingly, and royal life&mdash;Mark 4:26; 1 John 3:9.</li>
	<li>Reigning in life in Romans 5 is the key to everything in Romans 6&mdash;16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to see everything in chapters 6 through 16 in this light.</li>
		<li>If we reign in life, we are in all the matters presented in these chapters.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In experience, to reign in life means to be under the ruling of the divine life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is a pattern of reigning in life by being under the ruling of the divine life of the Father&mdash;Matt. 8:9.</li>
		<li>Paul is an example of one who, in his life and ministry, was under the ruling of the divine life to live to the Lord for the Body&mdash;2 Cor. 2:12-14; 5:14; Rom. 14:7-9.</li>
		<li>There is the need for all the believers who have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to practice the restriction and limitation in the divine life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The issue of our reigning in life, living under the ruling of the divine life, is the real and practical Body life expressed in the church life.</li>
	<li>Each item of the living of the Body life in Romans 12&mdash;13 requires us to be ruled by the divine life to live to the Lord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be captivated by the compassions of God&mdash;12:1a.</li>
		<li>We must present our bodies as a living sacrifice&mdash;v. 1b.</li>
		<li>We should not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		<li>We should not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think, but think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>We should consider that in the Body of Christ we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function&mdash;vv. 4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to live a life of the highest virtues for the Body life by reigning in life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should love without hypocrisy and love one another warmly in brotherly love&mdash;vv. 9a, 10a.</li>
		<li>We should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit, serving the Lord&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		<li>We should endure in tribulation&mdash;v. 12b.</li>
		<li>We should rejoice with those who rejoice, and we should weep with those who weep&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		<li>If possible, as far as it depends on us, we should live in peace with all men&mdash;v. 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Reigning in life is &ldquo;unto eternal life&rdquo;&mdash;5:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Unto eternal life</em> is a particular expression.</li>
		<li>John 4:14b says, &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Into</em> (<em>unto</em> in Romans 5:21) speaks of destination and also means &ldquo;to become&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>The eternal life will eventually be the New Jerusalem.</li>
			<li><em>Into eternal life</em> means &ldquo;into the New Jerusalem.&rdquo;</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the totality of the divine life, the totality of the life of God.</li>
		<li>The issue and goal of our reigning in life are for us to become the New Jerusalem, the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity.</li>

the Law of the Spirit of Life for the Body Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:15&mdash;8:2, 4, 6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The key to being an overcomer is the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8, a chapter for desperate seekers&mdash;7:24&mdash;8:2, 28-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Romans 7 is the experience of being &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo;; Romans 8 is the experience of being &ldquo;in the spirit&rdquo; (the divine Spirit dwelling in our human spirit and these two mingled together to be one spirit)&mdash;vv. 4, 9-10, 16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
	<li>The enjoyment of the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8 ushers us into the reality of the Body of Christ in Romans 12; this law operates within us as we live in the Body and for the Body&mdash;8:2, 28-29; 12:1-2, 11; Phil. 1:19.</li>
	<li>The whole key to our living and service in the Body of Christ is the law of the Spirit of life, which operates within us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The law of the Spirit of life makes us God in life, nature, and expression but not in the Godhead, shaping us into the image of the firstborn Son of God so that we may become His corporate expression&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 29.</li>
		<li>The law of the Spirit of life constitutes us the members of the Body of Christ with all kinds of functions&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12, 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to experience the indwelling Christ as the law of the Spirit of life, we must see the three lives and four laws in Romans 7 and 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The created human life with the law of good is in our soul; this law derives from the natural human life, that is, from man himself&mdash;7:21-23; Gen. 1:31; Eccl. 7:29.</li>
	<li>The evil satanic life with the law of sin and of death is in our flesh; this law derives from Satan, who as sin dwells in the believers&rsquo; flesh&mdash;Rom. 6:6; 7:15-20, 23-24; 1 John 3:10; John 8:44; Matt. 13:38; 23:33; 3:7; Rom. 3:13.</li>
	<li>The uncreated divine life with the law of the Spirit of life is in our human spirit; this law derives from God, who as the Spirit dwells in man&rsquo;s spirit&mdash;8:2, 9-10, 16; John 1:4; 10:10b; 14:6a; 1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Every life has a law and even is a law; God&rsquo;s life is the highest life, and the law of this life is the highest law&mdash;cf. John 1:4-5; 12:24; 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>The Triune God has been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become the law of the Spirit of life installed in our spirit as a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; law, an automatic principle&mdash;Rom. 8:2-3, 11, 34, 16.</li>
		<li>The law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the divine life; it is the natural characteristic and the innate, automatic function of the divine life&mdash;12:2; Phil. 2:13; Ezek. 36:26-27; Isa. 40:28-31; Heb. 12:2a; Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:28-29; cf. Prov. 30:18-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>These three parties with the three laws are now present in the believer in much the same way that they (God, man, and Satan) were present in the garden of Eden (Gen. 3).</li>
	<li>In addition to these three laws within the believer, there is the law of God outside of him&mdash;Rom. 7:22, 25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>While we remain in touch with the Lord, staying in contact with Him, the law of the Spirit of life works automatically, spontaneously, and effortlessly:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must cease from our own struggling and striving&mdash;Gal. 2:20a; cf. Rom. 7:15-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we have not seen that sin is a law and that our will can never overcome this law, we are trapped in Romans 7; we will never arrive at Romans 8.</li>
		<li>Paul willed again and again, but the result was only repeated failure; the best that a man can do is to make resolutions&mdash;7:18.</li>
		<li>When sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by our willing to do the good, it becomes &ldquo;the evil&rdquo;&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		<li>Instead of willing, we should set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit&mdash;8:6, 4; Phil. 2:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must cooperate with the indwelling, installed, automatic, and inner-operating God by prayer and by having a spirit of dependence, calling upon the Lord to maintain our fellowship with Him&mdash;Rom. 10:12-13; 1 Thes. 5:17; Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>We must care for the sense of life in our spirit in order to remain in the fellowship of life, the flowing of the divine life, for the operation of the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;Rom. 8:6, 16; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sense of life, on the negative side, is the feeling of death&mdash;weakness, emptiness, uneasiness, restlessness, depression, dryness, darkness, pain, etc.</li>
		<li>The sense of life, on the positive side, is the feeling of life and peace&mdash;strength, satisfaction, peace, rest, release, livingness, watering, brightness, comfort, etc.</li>
		<li>The sense of life is related to the consciousness of the conscience according to the life of God&mdash;Eph. 4:18-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must take heed to our spirit and guard our heart; the spirit is the organ to contact the life of God, and the heart is the key, the switch, the strategic point, which allows the life of God to be dispensed into us and freely operate in us&mdash;Psa. 78:8; Mal. 2:15-16; Prov. 4:23; Ezek. 36:26; Eph. 3:17; cf. Ezek. 14:3.</li>
	<li>We must walk according to the spirit&mdash;live in the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 16; cf. 1 Cor. 2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The secret of experiencing Christ is to be in Him, the One who empowers us to do all things, and the secret of being in Him is to be in our spirit&mdash;Phil. 4:12-13, 23.</li>
		<li>In order to live in our spirit, we must take time to behold the Lord, praying to fellowship with Jesus to bathe in His countenance, to be saturated with His beauty, and to radiate His excellence&mdash;2 Cor. 3:16, 18; cf. Matt. 14:23.</li>
		<li>In order to live in our spirit, we must pray without ceasing&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17; cf. John 20:22; Lam. 3:55-56; Rom. 10:12-13.</li>
		<li>In order to live in our spirit, we must remain in the fellowship of the divine life to walk in the divine light&mdash;1 John 1:2-3, 6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must mind the things of the Spirit&mdash;set our mind on the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must pay attention to the sense of our spirit in order to not grieve the Spirit and not quench the Spirit&mdash;Mal. 2:15-16; Eph. 4:30; 1 Thes. 5:19.</li>
		<li>We can set our mind on the spirit by setting our mind on God&rsquo;s words, which are spirit and life&mdash;John 6:63; Isa. 55:8-11.</li>
		<li>To mind the things of the Spirit, that is, to set our mind on the spirit, is also to be one with the Lord to care for the church with all the saints in the inward parts of Christ Jesus&mdash;Phil. 1:8; cf. 2:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must put to death by the Spirit the practices of our body&mdash;Rom. 8:13; Zech. 4:6; Gal. 5:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must allow the Spirit to inhabit and reside in our inward being&mdash;Rom. 8:9, 11.</li>
		<li>We must remain in the church life, where the God of peace crushes Satan under our feet&mdash;12:1-2, 11; 16:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must be led by the Spirit as the sons of God&mdash;8:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be led by the Spirit is to take care of the inner anointing, the moving and working of the indwelling, compound Spirit&mdash;1 John 2:20, 27.</li>
		<li>To be led by the Spirit is to care for the rest in our spirit, that is, to be led as a captive in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession&mdash;2 Cor. 2:12-14; 7:5-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship&mdash;Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we cry &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; (Rom. 8:15), &ldquo;the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo; (v. 16).</li>
		<li>To cry &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; expresses the sweetness of our intimate relationship with our God&mdash;cf. Matt. 18:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must groan in the interceding Spirit for our full sonship, which is the redemption of our body&mdash;Rom. 8:23, 26-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In our groaning the Spirit groans also, interceding for us.</li>
		<li>The interceding Spirit prays for us that we may be conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;vv. 28-29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must love God and be constrained, restricted, and motivated by the love of Christ to more than conquer in all things&mdash;vv. 31-39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By loving God, we participate in all the riches contained in God&mdash;1 Cor. 2:9-10.</li>
		<li>We must be constrained by the love of Christ to love God and the saints with Christ as our love&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The processed and consummated Triune God, as the spontaneous and automatic power of the law of the Spirit of life, accomplishes the following things within us:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This power inclines our heart toward God&mdash;Prov. 21:1; Psa. 119:36.</li>
	<li>This power makes us submissive toward God&mdash;Phil. 2:13.</li>
	<li>This power causes us to do the good works which God has ordained for us so that we may live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus&mdash;Eph. 2:10.</li>
	<li>This power causes us to labor for the Lord with all our heart and strength&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10; Col. 1:28-29.</li>
	<li>This power causes our service to be living and fresh&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>

<li>Ultimately, our enjoyment of the indwelling Spirit as the automatic law of the divine life is in the Body of Christ and for the Body of Christ with the goal of making us the same as God in life, nature, and expression but not in the Godhead to accomplish the goal of His eternal economy&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 28-29; 12:1-2; 11:36; 16:27; Phil. 1:19.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The book of Romans reveals the intrinsic significance of the resurrection of Christ&mdash;4:17; 6:4; 14:9; 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is the One who gives life to the dead; this is God&rsquo;s great power of resurrection&mdash;the power that Abraham experienced when he offered Isaac according to God&rsquo;s command&mdash;4:17; Heb. 11:17-19.</li>
	<li>Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, that is, through the manifestation of divinity&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 1:4; 8:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Considering Christ as God, the New Testament tells us that Christ Himself rose from the dead&mdash;14:9; John 10:17-18.</li>
		<li>Regarding Christ as man, the New Testament says that God raised Him from the dead&mdash;Rom. 8:11, 34; Acts 2:24; 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus was raised from the dead for our justification&mdash;Rom. 4:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection proves that God&rsquo;s requirements were satisfied by His death for us, that we are justified by God because of His death, and that in Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God&mdash;3:24.</li>
		<li>As the resurrected One, He is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God&mdash;8:10; Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 5:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ died and lived again that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living; we live to the Lord, and we die to the Lord; therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s&mdash;Rom. 14:8-9.</li>
	<li>Christ was designated the Son of God out of the resurrection of the dead, and His resurrection was His birth as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son&mdash;1:4; 8:29; Acts 13:33:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Before His incarnation Christ already was the Son of God, the only begotten Son&mdash;John 1:18; Rom. 8:3.</li>
		<li>By incarnation Christ put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection&mdash;John 1:14; Rom. 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed; hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity, and now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity&mdash;Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5.</li>
		<li>By incarnation Christ brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship&mdash;Acts 7:56; Matt. 26:64; Dan. 7:13.</li>
		<li>In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:5.</li>
		<li>God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons&mdash;Rom. 8:29-30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In resurrection Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit&mdash;vv. 9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into the believers&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:18; John 14:16-17.</li>
		<li>The reality of resurrection is Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:3-4, 20, 45b.</li>
		<li>Not only has Christ become the life-giving Spirit, but when He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ&mdash;John 20:21-22.</li>
		<li>When we receive Christ today, we receive not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ; now we enjoy the redeeming Christ, the Lamb, and the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit&mdash;1:29; 20:22; Rom. 8:3, 9.</li>
		<li>If we know and experience Christ as the pneumatic Christ, we will be brought into resurrection and live in resurrection&mdash;John 11:25; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		<li>The pneumatic Christ is the indwelling Christ; in resurrection Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in the believers&mdash;Rom. 8:9-10; John 14:16-17; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Romans unveils crucial aspects of the believers&rsquo; experience of Christ in His resurrection life&mdash;4:24; 10:9; 6:4-5, 8-9; 7:4; 8:11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We believe on God who has raised Jesus our Lord from the dead; the faith that is accounted to us as righteousness is our believing on God, who righteously judged Christ for our sins, righteously put Him to death in our place, and righteously raised Him from the dead&mdash;4:3, 9, 22, 24-25.</li>
	<li>If we confess with our mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in our heart that God has raised Him from the dead, we will be saved&mdash;10:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s being raised from the dead was invisible; hence, it requires our believing.</li>
		<li>Although Christ&rsquo;s death has redeemed us, it is His life in resurrection alone that can save us&mdash;3:24; 5:10.</li>
		<li>Only when we believe in the great miracle that God performed in Him in raising Him from the dead can we be both redeemed and saved&mdash;6:4; 10:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After baptism we become a new person in resurrection, and we walk in newness of life&mdash;6:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Resurrection is not only a future state; it is also a present process&mdash;8:11.</li>
		<li>To walk in newness of life is to live today in the realm of resurrection and to reign in life&mdash;6:4; 5:17.</li>
		<li>Living in the realm of resurrection is a living that deals with all that is of Adam in us until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;12:2; 8:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Romans 6:5 says that we will be in the likeness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; this does not refer to a future, objective resurrection but to the present process of growth:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Just as the element of Christ&rsquo;s death is found only in Him, so the element of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is found only in Christ Himself; He Himself is resurrection&mdash;John 11:25.</li>
		<li>After experiencing a proper baptism, we continue to grow in and with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection; this is to walk in newness of life&mdash;Rom. 6:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In His resurrection Christ is transcendent over corruption and death; since we are one with Him in this resurrection, we also are transcendent over corruption and death&mdash;vv. 8-9.</li>
	<li>We have been joined to Him who has been raised from the dead, to the resurrected Christ as our Husband; this joining indicates that in our new status as a wife, we have an organic union in person, name, life, and existence with Christ in His resurrection&mdash;7:4.</li>
	<li>If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in us, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to our mortal body and to our entire tripartite being so that we may carry out God&rsquo;s will to have the Body of Christ&mdash;8:2, 6, 10-11; 12:1-2, 4-5.</li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is absolutely in the resurrection life of Christ&mdash;8:11; 12:4-5; 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6; Matt. 16:18; cf. Gen. 2:21-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is a new creation in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>To be in the reality of the Body of Christ, we need to be absolutely in the resurrection life of Christ&mdash;John 11:25; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 1:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Body of Christ is in resurrection, that is, in the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:9-10; 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
			<li>The Body of Christ is the issue of our living by the resurrection life of Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:4-5, 8-9; 8:11; 12:4-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order to live the Body life in the local churches, we need to live in the organic union with the resurrected Christ&mdash;vv. 4-5; 16:1, 3-5, 7-13, 16.</li>

<li>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to dispense Himself as the law of the Spirit of life into man so that His divine attributes of righteousness, holiness, and glory would become man&rsquo;s human virtues for God&rsquo;s corporate expression as the reality of the Body of Christ in the local churches to consummate the New Jerusalem as the city of righteousness, holiness, and glory&mdash;Gen. 2:9; John 10:10b; 14:6a; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:2, 9-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s desire is to work Himself into us to the extent that He becomes us and we become Him, that we and He become completely identical in life, nature, and image; this is the pinnacle of His economy&mdash;John 1:12-13; 2 Pet. 1:4; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>Man was created in the image of God as a living vessel to receive and contain God as life for the reproduction, the duplication, of God in life&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:7; Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:7; John 12:24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ died on the cross to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory and was resurrected to become the life-dispensing Spirit as the reality of the tree of life to be our righteousness, holiness, and glory&mdash;Gen. 3:24; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 1:30; cf. Eph. 5:25-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life of the Triune God dispensed into our tripartite being makes us men of life to be God&rsquo;s sons and the members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ for His expression, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s original intention&mdash;Gen. 2:7, 9; Rom. 8:14; 12:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life [Gk. <em>zoe</em>] has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;&mdash;8:2.</li>

		<li>&ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life [Gk. <em>zoe</em>] and peace&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life [Gk. <em>zoe</em>] to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you&rdquo;&mdash;v. 11.</li>

	<li>The three primary colors of the rainbow around God&rsquo;s throne are blue (the color of the sapphire throne, which signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;Ezek. 1:26; Psa. 89:14), red (the color of the sanctifying fire, which signifies God&rsquo;s holiness&mdash;Ezek. 1:4, 13, 27; Heb. 12:29), and yellow (the color of the glowing electrum, which signifies God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Ezek. 1:4, 27; Heb. 1:3):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The rainbow around God&rsquo;s throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His new covenant to impart the newness of life into His chosen ones to make them the New Jerusalem while executing His judgment upon the earth&mdash;Gen. 9:13; Rev. 4:3; 21:2; Rom. 6:4; Ezek. 1:26-28; 36:26-27.</li>
		<li>The spiritual reality of this rainbow should be manifest in the church today; we need to allow God to fill us with His righteous presence by giving Him the full opportunity to work in us as the sanctifying fire for His radiant expression of glory through our coordination as the corporate Christ&mdash;1:5-14, 26-28.</li>
		<li>Christ Himself, signified by the rainbow of righteousness, holiness, and glory, is the covenant of God given to His people for their &ldquo;Christification,&rdquo; which is to make them exactly the same as He is in life, nature, and expression but not in the Godhead&mdash;Isa. 42:6; Heb. 8:10-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is wisdom to us from God, transmitting Himself into us as righteousness (that we might be reborn in our spirit), sanctification (that we might be transformed in our soul), and redemption (that we might be glorified in our body)&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 8:10; 12:2; 8:23; Phil. 3:21.</li>
	<li>The transmission of Christ, as the multifarious wisdom of God, into our being makes us the masterpiece of the Triune God as the wise exhibition of all that He is, a poem expressing His infinite wisdom and divine design&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 2:10; 3:9-11.</li>
	<li>In eternity as the New Jerusalem (a city whose foundations have the appearance of a rainbow&mdash;Rev. 21:19-20), we will be a rainbow to testify of God&rsquo;s faithfulness to carry out His new covenant in making us exactly the same as He is as righteousness, holiness, and glory&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals that in every church there must be the base of God&rsquo;s righteousness (God&rsquo;s procedure), the process of God&rsquo;s holiness (God&rsquo;s nature), and the goal of God&rsquo;s glory (God&rsquo;s expression) to bring us into the heart of God to have the reality of the Body of Christ through the local churches&mdash;1:17; 8:10; 6:19, 22; 8:18, 21; 9:23; 11:36&mdash;12:5; 16:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Romans reveals the tabernacle of God as the Body life realized in the church life (chs. 12&mdash;16) with the basic structure of righteousness (3:21&mdash;5:11), holiness (v. 12&mdash;8:13), and glory (vv. 14-39):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption is in the outer court, sanctification is in the Holy Place, and glorification is in the Holy of Holies.</li>
		<li>The church life is the Triune God mingled with His chosen people, who are justified, sanctified, glorified, and built together to be the tabernacle, the reality of the Body of Christ in the local churches to consummate in the New Jerusalem, the ultimate tabernacle of God&mdash;Rev. 21:3.</li>
		<li>The dispensing of the Triune God is according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory; the ultimate goal of the dispensing of the Triune God as life is glory, the expression of God in and through the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 5:17; 6:19-23; 8:18, 21; 16:27; Eph. 3:16-21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s death is for God&rsquo;s righteousness, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is for God&rsquo;s holiness, and Christ&rsquo;s ascension is for God&rsquo;s glory; when Christ comes back, the glorification of His saints will be consummated.</li>
	<li>As our Substitute, Christ died on the cross for us in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteous requirements for our justification so that He could dispense Himself as life into us&mdash;John 19:34; Rom. 1:17; 3:23-25; 5:18; Rev. 22:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A proper Christian is one who has died with Christ and who conducts himself daily according to this fact; if a believer lives in a natural way, he will be unrighteous, but if he experiences the death of the cross, he will be righteous in everything, with everyone, and in every way&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 3:9.</li>
		<li>Only the death of Christ and our death with Christ fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and give God the ground to righteously dispense Himself as the divine life into our entire being so that we may be swallowed up by life to be the city of life&mdash;Rom. 8:10, 6, 11; 2 Cor. 5:4.</li>
		<li>To live and serve as a minister of the new covenant is to take the way of righteousness, the living out and genuine expression of Christ, by recognizing that we do not have any qualification to be a servant of God, that as a man in the flesh we are good for nothing except death and burial&mdash;Matt. 3:13-17; 21:32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Sanctification is the subjective activity of holiness; it is holiness in action:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Sanctification is the resurrected Christ as &ldquo;the Spirit the Holy,&rdquo; the sanctifying Spirit in our spirit, working Himself as God&rsquo;s holy nature into our being to make us the holy city&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16; 8:4.</li>
		<li>The divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy, the process of God&rsquo;s organic salvation as God&rsquo;s move to deify man, making man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; Eph. 1:4-5; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>To live and serve as a minister of the new covenant is to walk in newness of life and serve in newness of spirit as a laboring priest of the gospel of God in order to present the saved sinners to God as an acceptable offering sanctified in the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; 15:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ultimate goal of the dispensing of the Triune God is that God would be expressed through the Body of Christ for His glory in the church&mdash;Eph. 3:20-21; Rom. 8:19, 21, 28-30; 16:27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The oneness in John 17 is the church; when the oneness is realized in a thorough way, by the full denial of the self, the Son glorifies the Father in the church&mdash;vv. 1, 21-23.</li>
		<li>This indicates that wherever there is the proper church life, there is the glorification of the Father, for the church life expresses the Father.</li>
		<li>To live and serve as a minister of the new covenant is to do all to the glory of God for the exaltation of Christ&mdash;Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor. 10:31; Phil. 1:20; 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The dispensing of the Triune God as life according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory is for us to become the New Jerusalem with Christ as our solid foundation of righteousness, our pure constituent of holiness, and our radiant expression of glory&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-11.</li>
	<li>Thus, the Spirit, as the processed and consummated God, and the bride, as the processed and consummated church, are joined to become a loving pair of one entity in life for eternity&mdash;22:17a; cf. 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>

<li>&ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God&rdquo;&mdash;8:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression; the New Jerusalem is the aggregate of the divine sonship for the eternal, corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:14; Gal. 3:26; 4:7; Rev. 21:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to the revelation of the entire New Testament, God&rsquo;s economy is to produce sons by dispensing Himself in His Divine Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people; Christ&rsquo;s redemption brings us into the sonship of God&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 7, 10; 3:9; Rom. 8:11, 14.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose to have sons for His corporate expression&mdash;Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The central thought of the book of Romans is that in His salvation God is making sinners His sons with His life and nature so that they may become constituents of the Body of Christ for His corporate expression&mdash;3:23; 8:14, 29; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>We, the believers in Christ, are first children of God, and then we gradually grow up to become sons of God&mdash;Gal. 3:26; 4:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls&mdash;Rom. 8:14; 12:2.</li>

	<li>The sons of God have received the spirit of sonship with the sonship; they have the life, the position, the right, the privilege, and the blessings of a son&mdash;v. 15; Gal. 4:5-6.</li>
	<li>All the sons of God will be brought into glory; this is our destiny&mdash;Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:21:

		<li>Glorification is the step in God&rsquo;s complete salvation in which He will completely saturate our body with the glory of His life and nature according to the principle of His regenerating our spirit through the Spirit&mdash;vv. 21, 23, 30.</li>
		<li>This is the last step of God&rsquo;s complete salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem in the coming age&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 7, 10-11.</li>

<li>&ldquo;If children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:7; Titus 3:7; Eph. 1:11, 13-14, 18; 1 Pet. 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the designated Heir, Christ will inherit all things in God&rsquo;s economy, including the earth, the kingdom, and the throne; all that God is and has is for Christ&rsquo;s possession&mdash;Heb. 1:2; Psa. 2:8; Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 1:32; Matt. 11:27; John 16:15.</li>
		<li>Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is the appointed Heir of God, and we, the many sons of God, have been saved to be joint heirs with Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>An heir is one who is of full age according to the law (the Roman law is used by Paul as an illustration) and who is qualified to inherit the father&rsquo;s estate&mdash;Gal. 4:7:

		<li>In order to become heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, we need to grow in life unto maturity&mdash;v. 7; Heb. 5:14&mdash;6:1; 2 Pet. 1:5-7.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Divine Spirit Mingled with Our Human Spirit&mdash;<br />
the Secret of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation and<br />
the Key to the Entire Christian Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10, 17; 6:4; 7:6; 8:2, 4, 16</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The divine Spirit of life dwelling in our human spirit, with these two mingled together as one spirit, is the secret of God&rsquo;s organic salvation and the key to the entire Christian life for the reality of the Body of Christ in the church life to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 4, 16; 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine Spirit of life is the Spirit of God processed and consummated to be the life-giving, compounded, and indwelling Spirit, who indwells the believers as the reality of the pneumatic, pneumatized Christ, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, and as the reality of the divine resurrection; it is through such a Spirit of life that the eternal, only wise God, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden through the ages, dispenses Himself in His processed and consummated Trinity into the believers to be their dynamic salvation as their life and everything&mdash;Rom. 16:25.</li>
	<li>The human spirit of the believers is the believers&rsquo; spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit of life and mingled with the divine Spirit of life as one spirit; it is through such a human spirit that the people chosen by God participate in the dynamic salvation of God as their living in this age and their destiny in eternity.</li>
	<li>Hence, &ldquo;the Spirit...with our spirit&rdquo; in verse 16 of Romans 8 (the key chapter of the book of Romans concerning the Spirit of life and the spirit of the believers) is the most crucial secret in the whole book of Romans for God to execute His dynamic salvation and for the believers to participate in it.</li>
	<li>We all have to know these two spirits in the divine enlightenment that we may enter, by the Spirit of life in our regenerated spirit which is mingled with the Spirit of life, into the intrinsic essence of the dynamic salvation of God in Christ, which is the Triune God processed and consummated to be our eternal inheritance for our enjoyment.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are being saved in life by Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;5:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Having been reconciled to God, we are being saved in Christ&rsquo;s life, we reign as kings in this life, we walk in newness of life, and we serve in newness of spirit&mdash;v. 17; 6:4; 7:6.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, Christ is in us, Christ Himself is life, and our spirit is life&mdash;8:9-11; John 14:6; Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Christ...in you&rdquo; is the crucial point of the book of Romans&mdash;8:10.</li>
		<li>In chapter 3 of Romans Christ is on the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption; in chapter 4 He is in resurrection; in chapter 6 we are in Him; now in chapter 8 He is the Spirit in us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The spirit of sonship is our regenerated human spirit, mingled with the Spirit of the Son of God.</li>
		<li>Sonship is the reality of being a son; thus, the spirit of sonship is the spirit of the reality of being a son&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Romans 8:23 says that we have received &ldquo;the firstfruits of the Spirit,&rdquo; the foretaste of our full enjoyment of God; verse 26 says that the Spirit helps us by interceding; and verse 29 reveals that the Spirit conforms us to the image of the Son of God.</li>
	<li>All the above items are included in the one phrase <em>saved in His life;</em> to be saved in His life is to be saved in Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;5:10; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals that the Spirit of life is doing a fourfold work within us:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of life is the liberating Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we walk in the Spirit of life, we are freed from the law of sin and of death&mdash;Rom. 8:2.</li>
		<li>It is not knowledge that liberates us but the Spirit of life Himself; therefore, we need to pray ourselves into the liberating Spirit to live, move, and have our being in this Spirit, who is mingled with our spirit&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of life is the delivering Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because we are bound, we need liberation, but because we are fallen, we need deliverance.</li>
		<li>If we are in the Spirit of life, we will have a deep conviction that we need deliverance from our attitude, motives, thinking, loving, hating, decisions, temper, disposition, and many other items&mdash;5:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of life is the sanctifying Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be sanctified is to be saturated through transformation with all that God is&mdash;6:19, 22; 12:2.</li>
		<li>Sanctification equals transformation in Romans 12:2, which says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of life is the glorifying Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Eventually, the Spirit of life will glorify us for the full corporate expression of the Triune God in our entire tripartite being&mdash;8:30.</li>
		<li>He is leading many sons into glory by His divine sanctification to make us His glorious church&mdash;Heb. 2:10-12; Eph. 5:26-27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans reveals that the Spirit of the Son of God for our sonship is carrying out a fivefold work within us:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of the Son of God is the witnessing Spirit, witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God&mdash;Rom. 8:16.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of the Son of God is the leading Spirit; if we live under this leading, we will walk and behave in a way that proves we are God&rsquo;s sons&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of the Son of God is the interceding Spirit; there is Someone within us who is always praying for us and for others&mdash;vv. 26-27.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of the Son of God is the conforming Spirit, doing a work to conform us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;v. 29.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of the Son of God is the building Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All the sons of God are the members of Christ, and all these members are built up and coordinated together by the Spirit&mdash;12:4-5; Eph. 4:3-4.</li>
		<li>The mutual membership and organic relatedness in the Body for the proper church life is the ultimate work of the Spirit of life and the Spirit of the Son of God for our sonship.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The key point of the entire Christian life is that Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit lives in our spirit, and as the Spirit He mingles Himself with our spirit to make these two spirits one&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In our mingled spirit there is no problem, so there is no need of solutions; whatever we need is in our spirit&mdash;Phil. 1:19; 4:23.</li>
	<li>We need to forget about our weaknesses, our shortcomings, our failures, and everything of the self and set our mind on the spirit, that is, remain in the spirit by always paying attention to our spirit, using our spirit, and caring for our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:6.</li>
	<li>We need to be burning in spirit by praying in order to spend more and more time in the presence of the Lord; when we are genuinely burning in spirit, we are beside ourselves and are fools because of Christ&mdash;Matt. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:13; 1 Cor. 4:10.</li>
	<li>Even though our surroundings and circumstances may be miserable, we ourselves must be joyful in spirit, living in the reality of the kingdom of God&mdash;Rom. 14:17; cf. Dan. 3:19-20, 25; Acts 16:23-25; Eph. 4:1.</li>
	<li>When we are burning and joyful in spirit, we enjoy God, reign as kings in life, walk in newness of life, and serve in newness of spirit&mdash;Rom. 5:10-11, 17; 6:4; 7:6.</li>
	<li>When we turn to our spirit, remain in our spirit, and walk and live according to our spirit, we are the real sons of God and the living members of Christ, who are organically related to one another and built up together as a living Body to express Christ as a reality in the church life to consummate the New Jerusalem.</li>

7:17-18, 20-21; 8:4-6, 9-10, 13, 16; 12:11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The book of Romans is fully focused on life and is of three sections:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first section is on redemption for justification, the second section is on life for sanctification, and the third section is on building for the Body expressed as the local churches.</li>
	<li>In the section on life there are two key terms for our Christian life&mdash;<em>the flesh</em> and <em>the spirit.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to live by the mingled spirit, the Spirit with our spirit (8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17), we must see what the flesh is:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The flesh is the corrupted, polluted, and transmuted body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Man&rsquo;s body was originally pure, but through man&rsquo;s fall Satan injected himself into man, and man&rsquo;s body became the flesh&mdash;Gen. 3:6; Rom. 7:18a.</li>
		<li>Our body is &ldquo;the body of sin&rdquo; (6:6) and &ldquo;the body of this death&rdquo; (7:24); the body of sin is very active and full of strength in sinning against God, and the body of this death is weak and powerless in acting to please God (v. 18).</li>
		<li>As long as we are still living, until the day of our redemption, the body of sin and death is always with us&mdash;cf. 8:23.</li>
		<li>The word <em>flesh</em> also refers to our entire fallen being; man is totally flesh because the fallen being today is under the dominion of the fallen flesh&mdash;3:20; Gen. 6:3a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The flesh is the &ldquo;meeting hall&rdquo; and the compound of sin, death, and Satan; the flesh is a hopeless case and can never be improved&mdash;Rom. 7:17-18, 21; cf. John 17:15.</li>
	<li>The flesh is at enmity with God, not subject to the law of God, and can never please God&mdash;Rom. 8:7-8.</li>
	<li>Sin is Satan himself as &ldquo;the evil&rdquo; in our flesh&mdash;John 17:15; Rom. 7:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;The evil&rdquo; is the evil life, nature, and character of Satan himself, who is the indwelling sin in us; when sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by our willing to do the good, it becomes &ldquo;the evil.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Sin can deceive us, kill us (v. 11), lord it over us, that is, have dominion over us (6:12, 14), and cause us to do things against our will (7:17, 20); all these activities show that sin is a living person.</li>
		<li>Sin is the evil nature of Satan, the evil one, who, having injected himself into man through Adam&rsquo;s fall, has now become the very sinful nature dwelling, acting, and working in fallen man&mdash;cf. Matt. 16:22-23.</li>
		<li>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo;; in Romans 7:17 he says, &ldquo;It is no longer I...but sin that dwells in me,&rdquo; showing that sin is another person within us.</li>
		<li>In our flesh no good thing dwells, because the flesh is fully possessed, taken over, by Satan as sin&mdash;v. 18a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For the sake of His economy, God in His wisdom and sovereignty uses our sinful, ugly flesh to force us to turn to our spirit so that we may gain more of the Spirit for His building by the growth of God in us&mdash;Col. 2:19; Zech. 4:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are either in the spirit or in the flesh; there is no third place for us to be; the believer is a miniature garden of Eden&mdash;with God as the tree of life in his spirit, Satan as the tree of knowledge in his flesh, and his mind in between&mdash;Rom. 8:6.</li>
	<li>Judicially speaking, both Satan and our flesh were condemned once for all on the cross (v. 3; John 3:14; Heb. 2:14; 2 Cor. 5:21), but God allowed the flesh to remain with us to help us and force us to turn to Christ in our spirit and have no more confidence in the flesh (Phil. 3:3).</li>
	<li>Without the help rendered by the sinful, ugly flesh, we would not be as desperate to gain the Lord or to have Him wrought into us&mdash;Rom. 8:6, 13.</li>
	<li>Our goal may be holiness or spirituality or victory, but God&rsquo;s goal is to work Himself into us; often when we are in a difficult situation, we are more open to the Lord and more willing to turn to Him and allow Him to work Himself into us&mdash;vv. 28-29.</li>
	<li>If we seek Him, even the sinful compound of the flesh will become a help to us in gaining the Lord; because we fail so often, we are desperate to turn to the spirit, and in this way we gain more of the Spirit&mdash;cf. Exo. 23:23, 29-30; Judg. 2:21&mdash;3:4.</li>
	<li>Our hardships, defeats, failures, and disappointments force us to realize that there is no hope in the flesh; the flesh is good only to force us to turn to Christ in our spirit, to press us into the spirit, to make us desperate to get into the spirit, and to keep us watchful to stay in the spirit&mdash;Matt. 26:41; Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>The Lord does not care for whether or not we have a victory; the Lord cares for only one thing&mdash;that we gain Him as the Spirit&mdash;Phil. 3:8; 2 Cor. 3:17-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our spirit is a wonderful compound&mdash;compounded with Christ, the Spirit, and grace&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16; Gal. 6:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God wants us to walk according to this wonderful compound spirit (to have our being and our living with all that we say and do according to the spirit)&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:19; 1 Cor. 6:17; cf. Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
	<li>Only the persons who walk according to the spirit can be the proper members for the building up of a local church; if we do not have such a walk, sooner or later we will be a trouble to our local church&mdash;Gal. 5:16-26.</li>
	<li>Romans reveals that whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must be in spirit; this will keep us from the vanity of religion&mdash;1:9; 7:6; Phil. 3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of all spiritual things depends on the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit; hence, the reality of all spiritual matters depends on our spirit, not on anything apart from our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:5-6, 9-11.</li>
		<li>Whatever is in us is vanity unless it is &ldquo;inwardly,&rdquo; in our spirit, not &ldquo;outwardly,&rdquo; in the flesh&mdash;2:28-29; 8:4, 10, 13; 12:11.</li>
		<li>Everything that God is to us is in our spirit&mdash;8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God has reserved the human spirit for His purpose&mdash;Zech. 12:1; Prov. 20:27.</li>
	<li>Our spirit today is the real Bethel, the house of God and the gate of heaven; when we turn to our spirit, we are in the third heaven&mdash;Eph. 2:22; Gen. 28:12, 17, 19.</li>
	<li>When we are in our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of grace and being sustained by Christ to live a heavenly life on earth&mdash;Heb. 10:22a; 4:16.</li>
	<li>In our spirit we can overcome the world, and the evil one cannot touch us; the only way to overcome Satan is to stay in the high tower of our regenerated spirit&mdash;1 John 5:4, 18; John 3:6; 14:30.</li>
	<li>Because Christ as the life-giving Spirit has dispensed Himself into our spirit, our spirit is life (Gk. <em>zoe</em>)&mdash;Rom. 8:10.</li>
	<li>Our spirit is the place of oneness; we can be one only if we worship God in our spirit, which is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem&mdash;John 4:23-24; Psa. 133.</li>
	<li>Christ, the heavenly and spiritual food, is in our spirit, and we need to eat Him to be His testimony and grow up into Him for the building up of His Body&mdash;John 6:57, 63.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>&ldquo;That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 15:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s being a laboring priest of the gospel of God to minister Christ to the Gentiles was a priestly service to God, and the Gentiles whom he gained through his gospel preaching were an offering presented to God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By this priestly service many Gentiles, who were unclean and defiled, were sanctified in the Holy Spirit and became such an offering, acceptable to God&mdash;Rom. 15:16; 16:4-5.</li>
		<li>These Gentiles were set apart from things common and were saturated with God&rsquo;s nature and element, and were thus sanctified both positionally and dispositionally; such a sanctification is in the Holy Spirit&mdash;6:19; 15:16.</li>
		<li>Based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the Holy Spirit renews, transforms, and separates unto holiness those who have been regenerated by believing into Christ&mdash;3:24; 12:2; John 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul is a pattern of the priesthood of the gospel; in the Epistle to the Romans, which concerns the gospel of God, he tells us how sinners can be saved and justified by believing in the Lord, how they advance in Christ by being sanctified and transformed, and how they present themselves to God as living sacrifices so that they may become members of the Body of Christ to live the church life, expressing Christ corporately and awaiting His coming&mdash;1 Thes. 2:1-12; Acts 20:17-36; Rom. 1:16-17; 3:24-26; 12:1, 4-5; 13:11.</li>
	<li>The New Testament service ordained by God is that all believers are priests to serve God with the offerings that He desires&mdash;Rev. 1:5-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As priests of the gospel of God, we offer saved sinners, as parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ, to God as sacrifices&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
		<li>The offering of the believers to God is in three steps:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Those who preach the gospel offer the newly saved ones to God as spiritual sacrifices&mdash;v. 16; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
			<li>After the new believers grow and begin to understand what it is to be a believer in Christ, they are encouraged to offer themselves to God as a living sacrifice&mdash;Rom. 12:1.</li>
			<li>As the believers continue to grow unto maturity, those who labor on the believers present them full-grown in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to function as priests of the gospel, we need to see that the gospel of God includes the entire book of Romans; this Epistle shows us that when we preach the gospel, we make sinners the sons of God and members of the Body of Christ, and we help them to grow so that they can be active members in the practice of the Body life in the local churches&mdash;1:16-17; 3:24; 5:10; 8:16; 12:2, 4-5.</li>
	<li>The service of the priesthood of the gospel is the service of the church as the Body of Christ; the focus of our service is to save sinners and offer them to God, and the goal of our service is the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;15:16; 12:4-5; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Eph. 4:11-12, 16.</li>

	<li>The spirit in Romans 1:9 is not the Spirit of God but Paul&rsquo;s regenerated spirit&mdash;John 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ and the Spirit are with the believers in their regenerated human spirit&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16.</li>
		<li>In Romans Paul stresses that whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do toward God must be in this spirit&mdash;2:29; 7:6; 8:4-6, 9, 13; 12:11.</li>
		<li>Paul served God in his regenerated spirit by the indwelling Christ, the life-giving Spirit, not in his soul by the power and ability of the soul&mdash;Phil. 3:3.</li>
		<li>In order to serve in our spirit, we must sense the spirit, know the spirit, discern the spirit, and be burning in spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11; Heb. 4:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The apostle Paul served God in the gospel as well as in his spirit; the way to serve God involves service in the spirit inwardly and service in the gospel outwardly&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 15:19-20; 7:6; 12:11.</li>
	<li>Our service to God in the gospel concerning His Son is related to the three sections of the gospel of God in Romans&mdash;redemption, life, and the Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the first section we should help the saints to know what redemption is, to know that the cross has dealt with every problem between us and God, and to know that in Christ we have been forgiven of our sins, justified by God, reconciled to God, and accepted by God&mdash;1:16-17; 3:24-26; 5:1, 9-11.</li>
		<li>In the second section we should help the saints to know that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in us as our life, mingling Himself with our spirit as one spirit, and that now we may eat Him, drink Him, enjoy Him, be filled, saturated, and permeated with Him, and be saved in life and reign in life by being sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image&mdash;vv. 10, 17; 6:19, 22; 8:9-11, 29; 12:2.</li>
		<li>In the third section we should help the saints to know the Body, to live in the Body, to coordinate together as members of the Body, and to realize that spirituality is a Body matter and that our spirituality must be measured by the Body and be tested by the Body&mdash;vv. 4-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;serve&rdquo; in Romans 1:9 means &ldquo;serve in worship&rdquo;; Paul considered his preaching of the gospel a service in which he worshipped God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The worship of God is our service to God, and this worship includes all positive matters between us and God, such as contacting God, praying to God, looking unto God, waiting on God, having fellowship with God, and working for God&mdash;Matt. 6:9, 33; John 4:23-24; Phil. 4:6, 20.</li>
		<li>In the book of Revelation we see a special line&mdash;the line of worship&mdash;4:10; 5:14; 7:11; 9:20; 11:16; 13:4, 8; 14:7, 11; 15:4; 16:2; 19:4, 20; 20:4; 22:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God needs our worship, but Satan fears our worship of God, wants worship, and is seeking worship&mdash;Matt. 4:8-10; Rev. 4:10; 5:14; 13:4.</li>
			<li>We should seek to give special worship to God, because Satan is getting worship for himself more and more&mdash;7:11; 13:4; 22:9.</li>
			<li>If we live according to our spirit, God will gain our worship, but if we live according to the soul, Satan will gain our worship&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 8:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The worship that satisfies God the Father&mdash;worship in spirit and truthfulness&mdash;is the worship in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity by our drinking and flowing the water of life in resurrection&mdash;the fountain, the spring, and the river&mdash;John 4:14, 23-24; 7:37-39; Exo. 17:6; Psa. 36:8-9; 1 Cor. 10:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Samaritan woman worshipped God in her spirit by drinking of Him as the living water to quench her thirst; thus, God was worshipped by her in a genuine way&mdash;John 4:7-14, 23-24.</li>
			<li>Throughout the centuries, only a small number of Christians have worshipped God in spirit by drinking of Him as the living water&mdash;cf. Matt. 15:9.</li>
			<li>God in Christ as the Spirit comes to us as the living water for us to drink; when we drink of Him as the water of life, we worship Him in a genuine way&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 4:10, 14, 23-24; 7:37-39.</li>
			<li>We urgently need to enter into the real worship of God in spirit by drinking Him as the living water&mdash;4:10, 14, 23-24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Genuine worship is realized in the Body of Christ; worship in the New Testament is a corporate matter, and apart from the Body, it is difficult to have genuine worship&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 10:3-4, 16-17; 12:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The more we serve and worship God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son, the more we will enjoy the fullness of the blessing of Christ, and the more we will offer praise to God&mdash;Rom. 15:29; 16:25-27.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery...to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 25, 27.</li>
