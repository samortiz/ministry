<h2 class="head2">I. Doing Great Things and Prospering</h2><p>Antichrist will do great things and prosper (Dan. 8:12, Darby; v. 24). The Hebrew word rendered <i>did great things</i> (Darby) is a specific word indicating a marvelous and wonderful practice. Antichrist will do great things, things which have never been done before, and he will prosper.</p><h2 class="head2">J. Having a Fierce Countenance</h2><p>Daniel 8:23 describes Antichrist as &ldquo;a king of fierce countenance.&rdquo; As we have seen, Antichrist&rsquo;s appearance will be stout, overpowering.</p><h2 class="head2">K. Understanding Dark Sentences</h2><p>Antichrist will also understand &ldquo;dark sentences&rdquo; (Dan. 8:23). These dark sentences will be riddles, deceitful words of double and ambiguous meanings. It will be impossible to tell exactly what he is saying, because his words will have a double meaning.</p><h2 class="head2">L. His Power Being Mighty<br />but Not by His Own Power</h2><p>Daniel 8:24 says, &ldquo;And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power.&rdquo; Antichrist&rsquo;s power will be the power of Satan. Revelation 13:2 says, &ldquo;And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&rdquo; In a sense, Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">M. Destroying Marvelously</h2><p>We are also told that Antichrist will &ldquo;destroy marvelously&rdquo; (Dan. 8:24, Heb.). This indicates that Antichrist will destroy to an extraordinary degree. He will destroy cities and even nations in an unprecedented manner. I do not want to witness this on earth. I would rather observe it from the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">N. Destroying the Mighty and Holy People</h2><p>Antichrist will also &ldquo;destroy the mighty and the holy people&rdquo; (Dan. 8:24), the people of God.</p><h2 class="head2">O. Cunning and Crafty</h2><p>Daniel 8:25 says, &ldquo;And through his cunning also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand&rdquo; (Heb.). This reveals that Antichrist will be cunning and crafty.</p><h2 class="head2">P. Destroying Many in Their Security</h2><p>Daniel 8:25 also says that &ldquo;in security&rdquo; Antichrist &ldquo;shall destroy many.&rdquo; When many are secure and at peace, Antichrist will come and destroy them.</p><h2 class="head2">Q. Being Broken without Hand</h2><p>Daniel 8:25 also reveals that Antichrist &ldquo;shall be broken without hand.&rdquo; Eventually, Antichrist will be broken by Christ, not by any human hand.</p><p>All these points give us a complete picture of Antichrist as the little horn in Daniel chapter eight. Please remember that Antichrist is firstly the fourth beast of Daniel chapter seven and then the little horn of Daniel chapter eight.</p>
