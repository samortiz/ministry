   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO SAVED IN LIFE FROM INDIVIDUALISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:10 is a key verse, for it concludes one section and opens another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse covers both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Reconciliation includes redemption and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ died on the cross for our redemption; through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now there is nothing between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we still have a number of subjective problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, even after we have been reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because reconciliation through the death of Christ is an accomplished fact, in 5:10 Paul used the past tense with respect to reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But because we are still in the process of being saved in life, Paul used the future tense when speaking about being saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we shall consider the matter of being saved in life from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SEVEN NEGATIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the book of Romans Paul dealt with seven negative things from which we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have seen, the first item is the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Within our flesh, our fallen body, the law of sin works spontaneously and automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This law of sin is the power of evil that operates spontaneously within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second negative item is worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were born into a worldly environment and then raised to be worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Worldliness is in our very being; hence, it also is a subjective matter, a matter of our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need to teach a child to love the world, for there is something in his nature that causes him to love it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The love of the world is an element of our fallen constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The third item is naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have a natural life and a natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our very constitution is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these natural elements are enemies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These natural elements are deep within our being, much deeper than the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law of sin is related mainly to our flesh, but our natural being is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the sake of God s purpose, we need to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also need to be saved from our individualism, that is, from being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we all have the tendency to be individualistic, none of us naturally like to be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our married life exposes how individualistic we are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are individualistic, a wife does not like to be dependent on her husband, and a husband does not like to be dependent on his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s intention is not to have a group of individualistic believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, it is to build up the Body for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for this purpose to be carried out, we need to be saved from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life of Christ also saves us from divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we talk a great deal about oneness, we actually do not like to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be one is to be restricted, bound, and eventually put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where is the oneness in today s Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout the centuries, there has been a shortage of oneness among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of oneness, there has been division upon division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All divisions come from the element of divisiveness in our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sixth negative item from which we need to be saved is self-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By self-likeness we mean the appearance and expression of the natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be saved from self-likeness by being conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In so many respects we do not yet have the likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, we bear the likeness of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we need to be saved in life from self-likeness and conformed to the likeness of the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Finally, we need to be saved from our natural body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, in God s full salvation, our body will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The day is coming when our physical body will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>JUSTIFICATION, LIFE, AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a complete sketch of the Christian life and the church life, the book of Romans firstly reveals the matter of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because justification issues in life, the section after the section on justification deals with life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Life leads to the building, which is covered in the last part of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the book of Romans may be summarized in three words: justification, life, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither justification nor life is God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God s goal is the building up of the church as the Body for Christ s expression and as the house for God s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For this reason, the book of Romans begins with justification, goes on to life, and concludes with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As those who have been saved, redeemed, justified, and reconciled, we are not idly waiting for the Lord to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are being built up in the church life for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Beginning with justification, we must go on to the experience of life in order to reach the goal of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unless we experience life and have the building, the Lord Jesus does not have a way to come back.</S>
