   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this book, his pointing out of the iniquities of the nation is equivalent to his judgment of the nation.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. The general sketch: The book of Obadiah is the shortest book of the Old Testament, yet its content is very important.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jonah typifies Christ in two aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First, the death of Christ, as seen in Matthew 12:40: For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Second, the ministry of Christ, as shown in Matthew 12:41: Behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jonah was sent to Nineveh to preach the word of God; Christ was sent to the world as the Word of God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Ninevites repented because they heard the preaching of the word of God; yet those during the time of the Lord Jesus would not repent, even though they had the very Word of God among them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, the Ninevites will stand up in the judgment with that generation and will condemn it Matt 12:41 .</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He still loved His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, He sent Jonah to preach to them to give them one more chance to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Jonah not only typified Christ, he also typified God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>D. The central thought: There are three important messages in this book: 1 Or is He the God of Jews only? Is He not of the nations also? Yes, also of the nations Rom 3:29 ; 2 God is love who desires all men to be saved, not intending any to perish 1 John 4:8; 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Pet 3:9 ; and 3 Salvation is of Jehovah 2:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>4 God caused the sea to grow tempestuous against them, that they were unable to get back to the land 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>5 God caused the sea to cease from its raging 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>6 Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>7 God caused Jonah to repent and pray to Him in the fish s belly 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>8 God answered Jonah s prayer by speaking to the fish and causing it to vomit Jonah out upon the dry land 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>9 The word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>10 God caused the people of Ninevah to repent 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>11 God did not perform the evil which He had said He would do to them 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>12 Jehovah asked Jonah a question 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>13 Jehovah God prepared a gourd to be a shade for Jonah 4:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>18 God gave an explanation 4:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why did Jonah try to run away?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not because of cowardice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Jonah was a very patriotic prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Deep down, he was acutely aware that Assyria was the most powerful country at that time, and that one day Israel would be destroyed by Assyria.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He only wanted to see God judging Assyria for her sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He did not want to see Assyria repenting and causing God to have mercy on her.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, despite all the danger involved, he fled to Tarshish to hide from God.</S>
