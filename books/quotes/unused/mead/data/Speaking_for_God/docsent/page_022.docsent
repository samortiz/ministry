   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, within some of the saints there is a voice saying, "Let us go back to holding worship services!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way of everyone speaking is too hard; let us go back to the way of one person speaking and the rest listening."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, some would choose the easy way and go back to train preachers and then assign them to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They would say, "After all, this is also doing the work of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if this becomes the case, how will the Lord have a way to go on?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Will the word of the Lord still be propagated and prevailing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, the Lord will have no way to go on and propagate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we look at the various Christian organizations, we can see that they all have a long history, yet they do not have much increase, nor do they allow the Lord to have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How we hope that every one of us would have a ball in our hands and know how to use it, and that we all would play using the same ball.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is our goal, and this is what the Bible teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul said that we are not worshipping dumb idols, but we are speaking in the Spirit of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to the meeting, we must be in the Spirit of God, because when we are in the Spirit of God we cannot and will not be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we speak, we are in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The young people do not dare to speak in the meeting primarily because they are shy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They feel that they are the younger generation, so they are nervous and scared and wait for the older ones to open their mouths first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way they naturally become dumb, trying to worship God without exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Over a long period of time, this becomes their habit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not the proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the young people come to a meeting, they have to take the initiative to exercise their spirit and say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they should release their spirit and pray, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We love You."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you open your mouth in this way, you will breathe freely, and your spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the universe there are fixed laws in God's creation and in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that to call "O Lord Jesus" is an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we were to ask an unsaved person to call "O Lord Jesus," that would be a very difficult matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if you held him by his throat to force him to say it, he might not be able to say it because Satan is there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we talk to people about Chinese philosophers such as Confucius and Wang Yang-ming, they feel glorious and honored.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we talk to them about the Lord Jesus, they feel ashamed and oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because Satan, the devil, is still walking about, seeking someone to devour 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the gospel is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fact that we are able to spontaneously call "O Lord Jesus" is a strong proof that we have been saved, that we have been delivered out of the power of Satan, and that we are now in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more Christians call "O Lord Jesus," the better.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Stanza 1 of Hymns, #208 says, "O Jesus, I say Thy sacred name / A thousand times a day."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The writer of this hymn said that he says the Lord's name a thousand times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually a thousand times is still not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is just like our breathing it is hard to count the number of times we breathe daily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We breathe continuously; we breathe without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul told the Corinthians that whenever they meet, instead of worshipping the dumb idols, they should speak in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit" 1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we meet, we are not worshipping the idols, so we should not be dumb; rather, we are breathing a living Lord, so we all must speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hymns, #864 is on exhibiting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although exhibiting Christ is good, it might be a dumb exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It would be good if we changed exhibiting Christ to speaking Christ, because in speaking Christ we surely cannot be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the meetings, not only do we exhibit Christ, but even the more we speak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our natural concept we always feel that our own testimony is too common and too shallow and that it is not worth the trouble to speak and testify about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we must see that to speak in the meeting is not a question of whether or not we ought to testify; rather, it is a question of whether or not we ought to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For instance, although I am an older brother, I may come into the meeting filled with the Spirit and say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While I was still a student, one day the Lord Jesus met me, and I did not want the world any longer; the Lord captured me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of testimony is living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, do not think that it is useless to give an old testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can turn an old testimony into a new testimony; it all depends on whether or not our spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as our spirit is living, even if we speak just a few sentences in the meeting, the congregation will sense the freshness and be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the Christian meeting is for speaking.</S>
