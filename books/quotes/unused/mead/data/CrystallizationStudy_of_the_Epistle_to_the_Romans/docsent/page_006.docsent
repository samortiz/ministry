   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your presence all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, Your presence does prove that You are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You are the Spirit, so You are present with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your presence means everything to us in our life and in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We love You, dear Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are so dear, so loving, and even, Lord, so sweet to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord has brought us to the center of His gospel, and this center is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we touch Christ, we have to realize that our Christ is mainly in two aspects: His person and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is a wonderful, excellent person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is also an all-inclusive person who is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is a person in two elements: the divine element and the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the divine element He is God, possessing His marvelous divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We worship Him, admire Him, and adore Him for He is so divine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in His humanity He is a human being, but this human being is not that pleasant to us because in His humanity He belonged to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s original creation became old.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This implies that it became corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When new clothing becomes worn-out and dirty, it becomes corrupted, that is, it becomes old.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ became a part of the old creation, and spontaneously He became an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His incarnation, was He something new in humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That means God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is flesh a positive term?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is altogether negative.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ became an old man with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this flesh there are three involvements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, this flesh is involved with Satan, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan is a poison, so this flesh is poisoned by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, the flesh is involved with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin is a top evil in the whole universe; it is the evil nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sin is a poison which is contaminating and corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ became flesh, which had been contaminated and corrupted with sin, but praise the Lord, He became flesh only in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His being in the likeness of the flesh of sin is typified by the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness John 3:14; Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That serpent became Israel s savior in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A serpent is not a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But that serpent, as a type of Christ, uplifted by Moses in the wilderness was only in the likeness of a serpent, not in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This bronze serpent had no poison.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ became the flesh only in its likeness, but within Him there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This must mean something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did God in Christ become flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The flesh is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But He became this flesh only in the likeness of the flesh of sin without the poison of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, we will see that He did this with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third involvement with the flesh is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God did not create the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God created an earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Satan came in to systematize the entire earth, making it a cosmos, which we call the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This cosmos is full of Satan s power and evils.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the domain, the little monarchy, of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cosmos is Satan s kingdom which attracts and usurps people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So our flesh is attracted and usurped by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a flesh is poisoned by Satan, the enemy of God, contaminated and corrupted with sin, which is the nature of Satan, and also attracted and usurped by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this sense, Christ, as a man, being in the old creation, was an old man in its likeness with the flesh, which is involved with Satan, sin, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what I call the crystallization of this part of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is uttered only by Paul with such a simple expression the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What I have mentioned to you is a crystallization of this one term in Romans 1:3 the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ as God became the seed of David in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As such, He became a man of the old creation and was an old man with the flesh, which had been poisoned by Satan, corrupted with sin, and usurped by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These are all related to the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God became such a person for the purpose of terminating all these things, to get rid of them for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God would not, however, get rid of what He creates.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God would still keep it by the way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God became such a man in order to terminate all the negative things on earth, even in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But He would redeem that part which was created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, there is termination along with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now let us go on to see the essence of the work of Jesus Christ the God-man.</S>
