   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 7 Date: March 1, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE CHURCH Spiritual Principles Operating in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two spiritual principles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The other side of authority is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the church does not have authority, it will be filled with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is only authority, however, the church will be full of the law; it will be like a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the second thing is love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only love builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Arrangements for the Services</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to carry out the visitation work in an orderly fashion, we have divided the visitation into a few smaller groups and asked a few brothers and sisters to take charge of them: 1 transportation of out-of-town visitors, 2 special visitations, 3 correspondence, 4 nursing mothers, and 5 love feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Greek the word agape means love only.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The scope of service of the deacons office includes all the details of the business affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The affairs of the church are complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we cannot ask one individual to head up this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, the fourteen deacons should take turns heading up this work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither Democracy nor Authoritarianism</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every institution in the world has rules of conduct for the facilitation and order of conducting business.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to facilitate and order the spiritual things in the church, there are also rules of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the brothers and sisters handed themselves over, it was impossible for the whole church to rise up to serve; many held to the concept that as long as someone was taking care of the responsibilities, they could sit back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now everything is different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over, and the whole church has risen up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every brother and sister must have a part in the things related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the need of some kind of arrangement because so many people are serving in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without this, it will be easy to fall into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In making decisions, the worldly way is to vote by hand or ballot.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The minority yields to the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In some places authoritarianism prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In such places one man or a few men decide everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today there are ways of conducting business in every secular society.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to serve in the church, however, is different from the way of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Church service is according to God s revelation in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must take the biblical way of making decisions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the church does not take the biblical way of making decisions, I am afraid worldly ways will creep in.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The last church spoken of in Revelation 2 and 3 is the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It comes after the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s word to the last church is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word Laodicea is Laodikeia in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is made up of two words: laos and dikeia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Laos means the people, and dikeia means three things according to the lexicon: 1 customs and habits, 2 rights, 3 demands, judgments, and revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the word Laodicea means the people s customs, rights, and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The best way to express it is people s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Revelation 2 and 3, the word laos is used three times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Two times it is embedded in the word Nicolaitan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the original language, Nicolaitan is nikolaos.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Its root nikos means to subjugate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Laos, of course, means people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nicolaitan, therefore, means those who subjugate the people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord specifically pointed out His rejection and hatred of both Laodikeia and Nikolaos.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is wrong to resort to pressure and subjugation in the church services.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is equally wrong to resort to the principle of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the opinion of the majority, Christ was condemned and crucified Matt 27:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is wrong for church affairs to be determined by one person or a few persons.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Catholic Church, the pope decides everything by himself in the Vatican.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the work of the Nicolaitans.</S>
