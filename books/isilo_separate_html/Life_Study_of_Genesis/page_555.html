According to the righteous law of God, Simeon had no ground to be blessed. It is not an insignificant matter to be omitted from the record of God. Simeon was altogether too natural, never exercising any restriction over his natural disposition. I believe he was the one who initiated the plot to kill Joseph. Therefore, when Joseph's brothers came down to Egypt the first time, Joseph arranged for Simeon to be kept in prison. While he was in prison, Simeon might have said to himself, "I shouldn't have done that to Joseph." Simeon must have had a very cruel disposition. No matter what our disposition may be, we should not indulge in it. Simeon lost all the enjoyment of Christ through indulging in his disposition. He needed to share another's rich portion of Christ, the rich portion of Judah. Because "the part of the children of Judah was too much for them," Simeon was scattered among the people of Judah (Josh. 19:1, 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(d) Levi Receiving the Priesthood<br>because of His Faithfulness to the Lord</H2><P>Although Simeon and Levi were companions, Levi eventually took the opportunity to have his natural disposition changed. Both Simeon and Levi had a disposition to kill others. But at the time the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, Levi's killing disposition was used by God (Exo. 32:29). When Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets and saw the people worshipping the golden calf, he said, "Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me" (Exo. 32:26). Out of all the tribes, only one tribe, the tribe of Levi, gathered together unto Moses. Why did Simeon not join Levi? They were of the same natural disposition. However, when God's call came, one answered it, and the other refused to respond. This indicates that, although we may have a very ugly disposition, our disposition may still be useful in God's purpose. However, there are certain conditions that must be met. Firstly, we must consecrate ourselves; secondly, we must exercise our disposition against our natural likes and dislikes; and thirdly, we must use our disposition in a renewed, transformed way. Because the inhabitants of the city of Shechem were Levi's enemies, it was easy for him to kill them. But it was quite another matter to kill parents, brothers, sons, and relatives. In order to do this, you must exercise your disposition against your desire and use it in a new way, a way that is both for God and with God. Both Simeon and Levi, having a killing disposition, were able to slay others. However, the slaying of the men in Shechem did not require them to exercise their disposition against their own desire. Simeon did not join Levi in carrying out Moses' command because he was not willing to pay the price. Simeon might have said, "It was all right to kill the people of Shechem, but it is crazy to kill our brothers, our children, and our relatives. Yes, they all worshipped the idol. But God is merciful, and He will forgive them. Why must we kill them?" At that time, these two companions were separated. The one used his natural disposition for God, with God, and in a new way, and the other did not. Levi used his disposition in the way of transformation. Thus, Levi's natural disposition, his slaying disposition, was transformed.</P><P>Do not think it is impossible for your disposition to be used by God. It may be used by Him if you use it against your natural desire and in a transformed way. I have known some brothers whose will was very strong. Perhaps you would say that their will was stubborn. But because their stubborn will was used for God, with God, and in a new way, they were used by Him. God cannot use one whose will is like jelly. Such a will must be transformed into steel. The principle here is that our natural disposition can be changed and used by God. Levi not only slaughtered the men of Shechem, but also hamstrung their oxen. Through transformation work a disposition was not only used by God to kill the idol worshippers, but also to slay the sacrifices for offerings to God. Our natural disposition will be useful if three conditions are met: consecration, using it against our natural desire, and using it in a renewed and transformed way.</P><P>Because Levi's disposition was changed, he became a great blessing. God's Thummim and Urim were with him (Deut. 33:8), and he had the privilege of coming into the presence of God to serve Him. Although the double portion of the land is rich, the privilege of entering God's presence is intimate. The priesthood can be considered as the sweet portion of the birthright. Levi received this portion.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_554.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_556.html">Next</a> </body></html>
