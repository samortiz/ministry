   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND PETER MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT 5 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 3:13-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 3:13-18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 13 we have the expectation of the new heavens and the new earth filled with God s righteousness; in 14 to 16, the preparation for the coming judgment; and in 17 and 18, the conclusion, where we are told to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 3:13 Peter says, But according to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered dwells may also be translated makes its home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because this Epistle is on the government of God, eventually it tells us that there will be a new universe where righteousness will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that everything will be altogether under God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing will be wrong; nothing will be unjust or unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, there will be no need for any further governmental judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After all the material things are dissolved, God s promise as His everlasting word will still exist for His redeemed people to trust in and stand upon, with the expectation of a new universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not set our hope on the visible elements, but on what the word of God promises as our destiny, that is, the new heavens and a new earth, which have not yet come into our view.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new heavens and new earth will be the old heavens and old earth renewed and transformed through the burning of God s judging fire, just as the new man is our old man renewed and transformed Col 3:9-10; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God s governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in these two books concerning God s government this matter is stressed repeatedly 1 Pet 2:23, 24; 3:12, 14; 4:18; 2 Pet 1:1; 2:5, 7-8, 21; 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main thing we see in John s writings is God s love expressed in His life; in Paul s writings, God s grace distributed in His dispensation; and in Peter s writings, God s righteousness maintained in His government.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s life, dispensation, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of these three apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is of love, dispensation is by grace, and government is based upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and earth and it will saturate God s new universe prevailingly to maintain it absolutely under God s righteous order, so that there will be no need ever of any further judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>DILIGENT TO BE FOUND IN PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 14 Peter goes on to say, Wherefore, beloved, since you expect these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be found by the Lord in peace is to be found right in His eyes with both God and man at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peace is the fruit of righteousness Heb 12:11; Isa 32:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because this book emphasizes righteousness for God s governmental dealing, it charges the believers who are walking in the way of righteousness 2:21 to pursue peace Heb 12:14 , so that they may be prepared for the Lord s coming with judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:14 Peter exhorts us to be found by the Lord in peace without spot and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The heretics, who forsake the straight way and follow the way of unrighteousness 2:15 , are spots and blemishes among the believers 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the believers, who are pursuing peace as the fruit of righteousness in God s government, should be without spot and without blemish, like the Lord, who is the Lamb without blemish and without spot 1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
