   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PURPOSING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 19:21 says that Paul even purposed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If his being was not in the spirit, how could he have purposed in his spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If his spirit had still simply been an organ, how could he have purposed in this organ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To purpose means to do something with your being, not with an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 19:21 proves that, at that time, Paul's spirit had become his personality, his being, his man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, he purposed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>SERVING GOD IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 1:9 Paul tells us that he served God in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His spirit was the man, the being, the personality, in which he served God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PRESENT IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 5:3 and 4 reveal that Paul could attend a meeting of the church in Corinth in his spirit, even when he was not physically present.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was "absent in body, but present in spirit" v. 3 . Verse 4 says, "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ." This means that when the believers in Corinth and Paul's spirit were gathered together, his spirit was meeting with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this portion of the Word Paul seemed to be saying, "When you met in that meeting and my spirit was with you, I cast that sinful person into the hand of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How strong Paul was!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 4:21 says, "What will ye?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse also shows that Paul was one absolutely walking, moving, and working in his new being, in his new personality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OUR SPIRIT BEING REFRESHED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 16:18 says, "For they have refreshed my spirit and yours."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to learn to say, "My spirit was refreshed."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we say, "My heart has been hurt," or, "My emotion has been touched."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we must learn to say that our spirit has been hurt or touched or refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That part of your being which is touched proves in what part of your being you are living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you say that your heart has been hurt, then you are a person in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that you are still the old person in the old soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you say that your emotion has been stirred, it indicates that you are still a soulish person, living in the old being in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we must learn to say, "Brothers, my spirit has been hurt."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This may not sound very pleasant; but it is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Say, "Brother, you have touched my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may not seem sweet, but it is precise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we can say that our spirit has been refreshed by others, it proves that we are living in our new being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some verses in 2 Corinthians also prove that Paul was a man who lived in his new being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Corinthians 2:13 says that Paul had no rest in his spirit; 7:13, that Titus's spirit was refreshed; and 12:18, that Paul and Titus walked in the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul was bold to declare that he and his co-workers were those living in their new being, in their new personality.</S>
