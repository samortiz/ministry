Marrying Four Wives and Begetting Eleven Sons</H2><P>Eventually, Jacob married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives (29:15&#151;30:24). Jacob wanted to marry Rachel, but Laban deceived him and gave him his older daughter, Leah. Then Laban said that if he wanted Rachel, he would have to serve with him seven more years. Rachel and Leah were competing with each other, so they gave their maids to Jacob to give them more children.</P><P>Jacob came to Laban as a young, single man, but he left Laban with four wives and eleven children. His wives and children caused him to be greatly burdened and troubled. We may think that this was because of Jacob's mistakes, but we should not forget that Jacob was loved by God. Surely he was in the hand of God. God allowed him to have four wives and eleven sons because God destined him to live a struggling life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Endeavoring to Become Rich<br>by Deceiving His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob also endeavored to become rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill (30:25-43). On the one hand, Jacob deceived his uncle, but on the other hand, his uncle deceived him. Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times (31:7, 41). Actually, Laban was more subtle than Jacob, but Jacob was more benefited. When Jacob left Laban, he left with four wives, eleven sons, and many flocks and herds.</P><P>We will see in the next message that Jacob had to struggle to leave Laban. Laban pursued him and overtook him, and he had to face Laban (31:14-55). Eventually, he had to face his brother Esau (33:1-17). Before he faced Esau, he saw God face to face and even wrestled with God (32:24-32). He struggled with God, so God made him lame and changed his name to Israel, a prince of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The History of God in His Union With Man &nbsp; pg 66</div><br></body></html>
