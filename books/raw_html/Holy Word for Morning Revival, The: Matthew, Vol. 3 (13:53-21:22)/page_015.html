By this Matthew shows that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food. The question is how we can be inwardly cleansed. In order to be cleansed from within, something must get into us, and the only way this can take place is by eating. As the nourishing food, the Lord Jesus is the best cleansing element.</p><p>When it comes to the matter of eating, we must be careful not to eat any leaven. In 16:1-12 what is crucial is not the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, but the leaven. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees was their teaching (v. 12). God is endeavoring to put Christ, the bread of heaven, into His people, and the enemy is working to put in leaven as God’s children are taking in Christ. Those testing the Lord asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven (v. 1). Those who bring in leaven desire to see signs, miracles. But the Lord Jesus refused to show them such a sign. The pure bread, the pure Christ, does not perform signs. He Himself is the unique sign. The sign of Jonah (v. 4), the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ, was the only sign to be given. Every miracle, every sign, must be based upon the principle of the crucifixion and the resurrection.</p><p>In 16:13-20 the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi in the northern part of the Holy Land that their thought might be released from the foggy religious atmosphere of Jerusalem and the Jewish religion. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (vv. 16-17). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 18-19). The revelation concerning Christ is the rock upon which the Lord Jesus is building His church, and against this church the gates of Hades, the power of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18) cannot prevail. The church revealed in Matthew represents the kingdom with its reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself (Matt. 18:17-18).</p><p>Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection for the first time (16:21-27). The concept of bearing the cross in Matthew 16 is not that of suffering but of keeping the self under the termination of death. To remain there is to deny the self, bear the cross, and lose the soul-life (that is, lose the enjoyment of the soul in this age that we might gain it in the coming kingdom age). Resurrection follows termination. When we keep ourselves under Christ’s termination, spontaneously there will be a reaction in our spirit. This reaction is resurrection.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
