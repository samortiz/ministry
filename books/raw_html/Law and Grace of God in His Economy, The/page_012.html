<h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Salvation in Life<br />in Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection and Ascension</h2><p>In their experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, the believers also receive the salvation in life in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension (Eph. 2:5-8). This salvation is a salvation in life. We just need to believe into the Lord Jesus by calling on His name, confessing our sins, and praying to Him; then He will come into us. He is the resurrected and ascended One. Today He is in resurrection and ascension. When He comes into us, we are also resurrected and ascended in Him. This is salvation in life. This salvation is not something superficial; it is not merely to save us from hell. This salvation is the resurrected and ascended Lord. Today in His resurrection and ascension He has entered into us to be our person. We are also resurrected and seated in the heavenlies together with Him. This is the salvation that we have received. This salvation is the resurrected and ascended Christ becoming our grace.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having Obtained Access into<br />and Standing in God&rsquo;s Abounding Grace</h2><p>The believers&rsquo; experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy enables them to obtain access into and stand in God&rsquo;s grace (Rom. 5:2a). Today we are not under the law but under the grace in God&rsquo;s economy. This grace is God Himself. Sometimes I have heard people say that they flew from Taipei to the United States. In my heart I said, &ldquo;How could you fly from Taipei? It is not you who flew but the airplane.&rdquo; Some people say that they lean upon Jesus. This is wrong. If you fly from Taipei to the United States by leaning upon the airplane, this leaning is not dependable. You do not lean upon the airplane, but you enter into the airplane. You are resting while the airplane is flying; you enjoy the restfulness of flying. Noah was saved by entering into the ark, not by leaning upon the ark. Today we are standing in grace. This grace is Christ, the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Enjoying Eternal Comfort<br />and Good Hope in Grace</h2><p>In this grace we enjoy God&rsquo;s eternal comfort and good hope (2 Thes. 2:16). God&rsquo;s comfort is not temporary and transitory comfort but eternal comfort. This eternal comfort is the eternal life. We have the eternal life in us, and this eternal life is our eternal comfort. This comfort is sufficient for any kind of environment and situation. Furthermore, we enjoy good hope in grace. This means that at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we will enter into His glory.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Coming Forward with Boldness to the Throne of Grace to Find Grace for Timely Help</h2><p>Furthermore, in their experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, the believers come forward with boldness to the throne of grace to find grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16). The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven is also now in our spirit, where the habitation of God is (Eph. 2:22). Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, whenever we turn to our spirit, we touch the throne in heaven, and this throne is the throne of grace to us. When we come forward to the throne of grace, we receive Christ as grace for our timely help.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Receiving God&rsquo;s Abounding Supply of All Grace</h2><p>In their experience of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, the believers also receive God&rsquo;s abounding supply of all grace. Second Corinthians 9:8 says, &ldquo;God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work.&rdquo; Today we have God abundantly supplying us with all grace.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Constantly Enjoying God&rsquo;s Multiplying Grace</h2><p>We are constantly enjoying God&rsquo;s multiplying grace (1 Pet. 1:2b; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 22:21). Peter spoke of this multiplying grace in his first and second Epistles. This grace is not dead but living and multiplying; it is being multiplied to us day by day.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Enjoying God&rsquo;s Greater Grace by Being Humble</h2><p>The believers also enjoy God&rsquo;s greater grace by being humble (James 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:5). Grace has a measure. The Lord Himself is without measure, but our experience of Him has a measure. When we are humble and broad-minded, the grace in us is greater. When we are proud and narrow-minded, the grace in us is smaller. The measure of our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s grace depends on us. If we are broad, the grace is greater; if we are narrow, the grace is smaller.</p>
