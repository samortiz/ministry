   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we do not suffer, we have nothing to give others.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the grapevine undergoes many sufferings, dealings, cuttings, and breakings, it produces rich wine to cheer man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee realized that the more we suffer, the more we have to give.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without suffering, anything we say is like tinkling brass.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may make noise, but there is no life in what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, as this hymn says, our life is measured not by gain, but by loss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the reason Joseph could be so rich was that he had suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the years of his suffering he stored up the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the seven years of plenty, Joseph stored up the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not take care of his own interests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not an easy task to store all that grain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For seven years Joseph gathered the grain and stored it in barns.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a big job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, Joseph was laboring; on the other hand, he was suffering because he was separated from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During these seven years he did not care for himself, but made arrangements for others to be taken care of in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What he did in the seven years of plenty was for the people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did this at the cost of taking care of his own interests, at the cost of seeing his father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would be able to supply food to others, we must undergo a long period of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Joseph did not have all the grain when he was seventeen years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not have the grain until he was thirty-seven years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time he became rich not in power, but in food and in the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the same today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The older, experienced ones have the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again and again, Brother Nee stressed that we must take care of our physical life so that we shall not die at an early age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In one of his trainings Brother Nee asked the trainees what age they thought was the most useful age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he pointed out that a brother once said that the most useful age is from seventy to eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, Brother Nee charged the trainees to take care of themselves and not to commit gradual suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He told them to sleep well, eat well, drink well, and exercise well so that they might have a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Caleb was eighty-five years old, he said that he was just as strong as he was at forty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The riches are not with the inexperienced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be rich, we need to suffer for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It took Joseph twenty years, from the age of seventeen to the age of thirty-seven, to become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, after many years of suffering, the food was in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because he had the food, all the hungry ones came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to my opinion, Joseph should have been generous with the people and said, "Whenever you need food, simply come to me and I'll give it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I read Genesis 47 as a young man, I thought that Joseph was not generous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seemed to me that he squeezed everything out of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I praise the Lord for showing me why Joseph was not generous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason is that the life supply should not be sold cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If anyone in the church life is willing to give away the life supply in a cheap way, we must question whether the supply he has is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The genuine life supply is never sold cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Joseph seemed to be saying to the people, "Do you want the supply?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do, then you must pay the price."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The concept of generosity is a worldly concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Joseph was in another realm, where there was neither generosity nor scarcity, just the supply and the price.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many Christians today sell things cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in the Lord's recovery nothing is cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you want the food, you must pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The greater the price you pay, the greater supply you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some today are opposing the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But deep in their heart they know that this way is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They oppose it because the cost of taking it is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, they take the cheap way and criticize the costly way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot receive any food supply without a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Joseph will not sell you the food at a cheap price.</S>
