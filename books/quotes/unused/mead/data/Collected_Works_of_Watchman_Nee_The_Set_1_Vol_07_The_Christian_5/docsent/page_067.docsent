   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ELISHA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: I read 2 Kings 6:8-19 which says that the Syrians surrounded Dothan not for the sake of the Israelites, but to look for Elisha.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Syrians reached Dothan, why did Elisha say, "This is not the way, neither is this the city"?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was not the man of God lying?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yin</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: Elisha was a Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What he said to the Syrians was not deceiving them, because he led them to Samaria, that is, "to the man whom ye seek" v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE FOURTH GENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Question: I read Genesis 15:16, which says, "But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is this fourth generation?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please answer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tsui</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: This means that by the fourth generation the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, they would be led out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was literally fulfilled later.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read Exodus 6:16-20, we see that Levi was the first generation v. 16 , Kohath, the second generation v. 16 , Amram, the third generation v. 18 , and Aaron and Moses, the fourth generation v. 20 . It was at the time of Aaron and Moses that the children of Israel left Egypt for Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE HOLY SPIRIT SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Question: How does the Holy Spirit speak to man?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hsu</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Answer: The Holy Spirit speaks to man through the intuition in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person cannot hear Him with his physical ears, nor can he fathom Him with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can only hear Him through his intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should pay special attention to this matter at present.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The intellectual ones seek after the mind of the Spirit with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The zealous ones who lack scriptural knowledge and deep spiritual life try to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit with their physical ears.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These will lead people down the path of error.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are the ones who are deceived by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of the Holy Spirit's works are in our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Besides his soul, man still has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The greatest faculty of the spirit is the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The intuition is the direct sense within man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a physical sense, nor a thought in the mind, but an independent feeling that does not come from any source.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The voice of the Holy Spirit can be detected in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If believers today do not serve the Lord through following the intuition, they will trespass the Lord's will often.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Weigh</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Answer: Of course not.</S>
