We are getting ourselves prepared to read the word of God, not a newspaper or any secular book. First, [we must pray, &#8220;O Lord, cleanse me with Your precious blood. Lord], I am sinful, forgive me. I am mistaken; forgive me. I do not love You; forgive me. Even I do not fear You; forgive me.&#8221;...We must confess all of our sins to make ourselves pure and clean, without any hindering thing between us and God. Then we are in God&#8217;s fellowship. At that time we are in the Spirit of God, and when we come to the Bible, it is different.</p><h2 class=head1>Receiving the Word by Means of All Prayer</h2><p>Then we have to pray-read, not just read, the Word.... Throughout the centuries, all the devoted lovers of the Lord and students of the Bible practiced pray-reading in fact, though they did not have the term pray-reading. Some in the past pointed out that we have to read the Bible prayerfully. To read the Bible prayerfully is to pray-read.</p><p>We teach the practice of pray-reading based upon Ephesians 6:17-18.<sup>69</sup> [The apostle] Paul took in, received, the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. He not only prayed in a general way, but he also petitioned in a particular way. Prayer is general, while petition is particular. Not only so, Paul prayed with &#8220;all prayer and petition.&#8221; All includes a great number of ways. You can pray loudly, or you can pray softly. You can pray quickly, or you can pray slowly. You can pray-read not only in one way but in many ways: by yourself, with your spouse, with a group, and in the meetings. Paul said that we should receive the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition. This tells us that we pray all prayer and petition to take in, receive, the word of God.<sup>70</sup></p><p>[What is the most profitable way to touch and deal with the Word of God?] First, there is no need to close your eyes when you are pray-reading. Keep your eyes on the Word as you pray. In all of the sixty-six books of the Bible I cannot find one verse which says that we must close our eyes to pray, but there is a verse telling us that Jesus looked up to the heavens, saying, &#8220;Father...&#8221; (John 17:1). He was looking at heaven while He was praying....[Second], there is no need for you to compose any sentences or create a prayer. Just pray-read the Word. Pray the words of the Bible exactly as they read. Eventually, you will see that the whole Bible is a prayer book!...Open to any page of the Bible, and start to pray with any portion of the Word.<sup>71</sup></p><p>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&#8221; The words, the Spirit, and life are three items, but the Lord speaks of them here as one. When the words are merely words, they are only black letters printed on the white paper; they are not the Spirit. But when the words get into your mind through your eyes and you begin to pray with your spirit, then the words become the Spirit. When the words become the Spirit, they are life.</p><p>When we pray in our reading of the Word, we turn the verses we have read into prayer. When we pray, we must forget everything else and have only the Lord and His word. Hymns, #389 says, &#8220;From morning to evening my one world Thou art.&#8221; This means that when we seek the Lord, we have only one world: &#8220;O Lord, You are my world; I seek You.&#8221;...Once the word enters your spirit, it becomes the Spirit and life. However, if you do not pray, then the word that you read will not become the Spirit, nor will it become life.<sup>72</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
