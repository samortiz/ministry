When I was young, I read a book written by a Jewish scholar, David Baron, entitled The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew (1901). In this book there is a section on the significance of the Urim and the Thummim. Thummim means \u201ccompleters.\u201d There are twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet, but only eighteen letters were used for the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. After the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the breastplate, the remaining four letters were engraved on the Thummim, which was enclosed in the breastplate. In such a way all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were included on the breastplate. This is why Thummim means \u201ccompleters.\u201d "}]}
