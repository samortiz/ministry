   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VISION OF THE GROUND OF LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beginning in 1922, many local gatherings were raised up by the Lord in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By 1933, Brother Watchman Nee, realizing the confusion among the Brethren assemblies and being greatly concerned regarding the boundary or limit of a local church, read through the New Testament again in order to be clear concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By so doing he came to see that the boundary of a local church is the boundary of the city in which the church is located.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was a real deliverance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We became very clear that the church in Shanghai covered everything within the city limits of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From 1934 Brother Nee became more and more clear, not only concerning the boundary of the local church, but also concerning the ground of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in 1937 he delivered a number of messages to us regarding this matter, which are now contained in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The most emphasized point in these messages is the local ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the boundary of the local church, Brother Nee went on to see the ground of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was by 1937 that this became clear to us all, and it was at this time that the term "the ground of the church" was first used.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only is the city limit the boundary of the local church, but the city itself is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ground of the church is the city in which the church stands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a vase stands on a table, the table is the ground upon which the vase stands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A local church stands in a city; so the city in which it stands becomes its very ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since then, the Bible, and especially the New Testament, has been opened to us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From that time till now, there has been no further improvement in this simply because it cannot be improved upon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is exceedingly clear that the church ground is the city, the very locality in which the church stands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some say that we have learned concerning the local church ground from the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Brethren did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they had seen the unique ground of the church, they could not have many assemblies in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why is the church ground important and necessary?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And why do we stress this matter so much?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must all realize that the church in the entire universe is one Body; thus, regarding the church there is a real oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could your body be divided?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can divide anything else, but you can never divide your body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the Body of Christ, the church must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This oneness of the church is expressed in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was expressed in Jerusalem, it was expressed in Antioch, and it was expressed in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the many local expressions of the church do not mean that the church is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is only one United States of America.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the United States has many expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Toronto the United States has one consulate or one expression; likewise, in Vancouver there is one, in Mexico City one, in Hong Kong one, in London one, in Tokyo one, and in Paris one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many expressions, but only one United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The many consulates of the United States throughout the world as her many expressions do not mean that she is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But there can never be more than one consulate of the United States in any one city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If in London today there were two consulates of the United States, it would mean that the United States is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of the size of a city, as long as a consulate of the United States is there, that consulate must be uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It may have many offices, but it must only be one consulate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tokyo is the largest city on earth today, but it has only one American consulate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there were more than one, it would mean division.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is one; she should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the church must be expressed in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in every city, if there is an expression of the church, that expression must be uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it is otherwise, there is division, and that cannot be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As an American citizen in Tokyo, would you need to choose to which American consulate you should go?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course not; you have no choice in the matter, for there is only one American consulate in Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All you need to know is the address and how to get there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church today has been divided simply by many different kinds of expressions in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the second world war, Christians became so free, especially in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were dissatisfied with the denominations; so they left and formed many smaller groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Formerly, the number of different kinds of expressions of the church was smaller, but now it has been greatly increased.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was told that in Southern California alone there are at least one thousand small Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who are in these smaller groups do not sense that they are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They claim to be groups which are seeking the true way, but in fact they are many small divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So many know that the large denominations are divisive and sectarian, but they simply do not realize the divisiveness of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you point this out to them, they will say that they are all one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This sounds good, but it is just a kind of saying; in fact, they are not one, but divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose the United States were divided into three separate countries.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What weakness would result!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is just the subtlety of the enemy with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has divided the Body of Christ not only into parts, but into many pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why the church today is so weak.</S>
