   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD'S CREATION 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1, 26-27; 2:7-9, 10-14, 18-24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's economy is the main topic of the entire Bible, yet it is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was hidden in God in eternity past and continued to be hidden in God for the first four thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the time of Adam to the time of the apostles, God's economy was not revealed to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day the Lord called a man named Saul later called Paul .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He regenerated him and showed him God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Apostle Paul told us that God's economy had been hidden in God from the ages that is, from eternity and through all past ages Eph 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was the one who began to see something hidden in God, something in God's heart that had never been revealed to the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul received a revelation of this mystery, and in his fourteen Epistles, God's economy is stressed, emphasized, and developed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul tells us that the New Testament ministers and teachers should only teach one thing God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To teach anything else is to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christianity has been divided mainly by different teachings, yet in the Bible there is only one main teaching the teaching of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter we want to see the divine economy in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GOD'S CREATION OF MAN IN HIS IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>AS A VESSEL WITH A HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 1 and 2 tell us about God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These chapters unveil the almighty and eternal God as our Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created the universe and He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis 1:26 tells us that God created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man was a copy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 2:7 gives us a particular account of God's creation of man: "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God created a body for man, and this body was created by God of the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our body is earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Medical students can tell us that the elements in our body are the same as the elements in dust.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is in the dust is also in our bodies, because our bodies are bodies of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God breathed the breath of life into this body of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that God created man with two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first element was dust, and the second element was the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One element was physical, and the other was spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The physical body can be touched and can be seen, but the breath of life is invisible and untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God breathed the breath of life into this body of dust, something came out a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The breath of life entering into the body of dust produced a man as a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This breath of life is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Proverbs 20:27 tells us that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Hebrew word in this verse for spirit is the same word in Genesis 2:7 for breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This tells us that the breath breathed into our body is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, in the first two chapters of Genesis we have a clear picture that man was made according to God, that he was a copy of God, and that man was created with a human spirit.</S>
