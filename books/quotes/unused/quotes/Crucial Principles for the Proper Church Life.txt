The vine and the branches are one, yet there is always the possibility, the danger, that a branch would be detached from the vine
Besides this, we have other times in which we come together in small groups to fellowship, pray, or have morning watch
Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveals that He is the life-giving Spirit
We have a human spirit that has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and is indwelt by Christ, the life-giving Spirit
Although 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that we are one spirit with the Lord, in our daily experience we are often not one with the Lord
Although electricity is powerful, if we do not contact electricity, we will have no sensation that it is powerful
Regardless of how close to or far from the Lord we are, if we are not contacting Him, it is essentially the same
If we are close to the Lord by being in a meeting, perhaps we will contact Him after hearing only a few words in the meeting
We need to have a direct contact with the Lord, just as an electrical appliance must have direct contact with electricity
According to our experience and the experience of many others, in order to abide in the Lord, we must rely on the word of the Bible
The Bible is not merely a piece of literature; it is the word of God, which is the very embodiment of the mysterious and abstract Christ
The sensation we have of the Lord's presence when we come to the Bible is not a psychological matter or something superstitious
When we read a magazine, however, even if we exercise our psychology to try to produce the same sensation, we will not be able to do it
When we come to the Bible and read it, the word of God repels all the evil thoughts and chases away all the demons
The written word is outside of us, but when the word is spoken into us by the Lord, it immediately becomes the Spirit within us
When we read the words of the Bible, they are words on a printed page, but when we take them in, they become spirit
Before we pray-read the verses, they are words, but when we take them in, the rest of the day they are in us as the Spirit
Many saints may say, 'Brother Lee, all that you say is right, but we just cannot find time to spend in the Word every day
Many saints today are spiritually sick and dying because they do not spend adequate time in the Word each day to contact the Lord
Even if the Lord has great mercy upon us, if we do not eat, we are rejecting the Lord's mercy and committing gradual suicide
We should consecrate ourselves to spend ten minutes in the Word before leaving for work or beginning the day's activities
If possible, we should set aside another five minutes to pray, to mingle what we have read in the Word with prayer
If we contact the Lord in His word before we go to work, our attitude will change, which will change our environment
Suppose we do not contact the Lord before we go to the office; rather, we simply go by ourselves in a poor way
To be angry in business is a great loss; it ruins the environment, and because we become angry, we may eventually damage our health
Our dishes and eating utensils have never offended us, but when we lose our temper, we may throw them against the wall
If we consider carefully, we will see that four legalities are needed for our physical life-eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping
He described how the women in southern China wash their rice by placing it in a basket made of willow branches, which serves as a strainer
If we do not come to the Word of God for one week, our thinking, our will, and our emotion will be very dirty spiritually
We need to realize that reading the Bible is not something religious or legal; rather, it is a necessity of life
Some sisters may think that they are too busy taking care of their husbands and children to spend time with the Lord in the Word every day
Reading the Word, praying to the Lord, and contacting the Lord to deal with Him are divinely ordained principles that we need to observe
After selecting a book of the Bible through the Lord's leading, we should pray-read from the first verse to the last consecutively
We need to read one chapter in the New Testament each day beginning from Matthew 1 until we finish the last chapter of Revelation
Question: Is there another way to come to the Bible besides the way of being nourished and the way of reading?
Answer: Everyone needs to read and pray over at least a few verses every morning and then read a few chapters later in the day
Our time in the Word in the morning should be in the way of being nourished, and our time later in the day should be in the way of reading
Many saints are daily enlightened and have their true situation and condition exposed in the light of God through their reading of the Bible
As we are reading consecutively, will the Lord shine on our condition regardless of the portion that we are reading?
Question: What does it mean that spending time with the Lord in the morning is the greatest honor we can give to Him?
These are all wonderful definitions of the church, but we need to see that the basic factor of the church is simply Christ
Although many Christians know that the church is the Body of Christ, they do not realize that the church is Christ
We would compose this very carefully because if we wrote what Paul wrote, we might be condemned for being too bold or even for blaspheming
If my finger and every other part of my body said this, there would be no Witness Lee but only parts of Witness Lee
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all'
God's eternal purpose is simply to gain a church for Christ that has Christ as its life and content, a church that is Christ Himself
Among the Epistles of the New Testament, Galatians deals mainly with Judaism, and Colossians deals mainly with Greek philosophy
Galatians tells us that Judaism should not be in the church and that the church has nothing to do with Judaism
When Judaism becomes prevailing in the church, the church is void of Christ and is therefore no longer the church
Although some of these concepts are scriptural, such as baptism by immersion, they have nevertheless crept into the church to replace Christ
Because they insist on a certain kind of baptism, their content has become this kind of baptism rather than Christ
When they are halfway through their meetings, a cake is brought out, and everyone enjoys the cake and begins to gossip
When we are void of Christ, we will have many preferences, but if we are full of Christ, we will bring only Christ when we come together
In order for us to have the proper church life, we must have adequate experiences of Christ so that we may be filled with Him
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
To cohere in Christ is to exist by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub
Every kind of light-moonlight, sunlight, electrical light, the light of an oil lamp-is a shadow of Christ; He is the real light
Colossians 267 says As therefore you have received the Christ Jesus the Lord walk in Him having been rooted and being built up in Him
Our being rooted in Christ is for the growth in life, and our being built up in Him is for the building of God's house
We will not care for our concept of what a low meeting, a high meeting, a living meeting, a silent meeting, or a loud meeting is
If those who would normally oppose the use of tambourines are filled with Christ, they will say, 'Whoever would like to play can play
If those who play the tambourines are filled with Christ, they will lay down their tambourines and say, 'Christ is our real tambourine
Since we have received Christ and possess Him, we need to walk in Him, be rooted in Him, and be built up in Him
Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
Timothy 4:22 says, 'The Lord be with your spirit,' and Romans 8:16 says, 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit'
To walk in Christ is to walk not according to our opinions or concepts but according to the mingled spirit within us
When we walk in the mingled spirit we experience Christ in everythingin marriage life in school life in office life and in the church life
Whenever we go somewhere, we usually go not from our spirit but from our emotion, mind, or will-from our natural man
The saints who say that they like a silent meeting or a loud meeting speak from their preference, not from their spirit
If they are walking in the spirit and say something concerning the meetings from the spirit, they will only say, 'Praise the Lord!
Recently, in certain local churches a disputation arose as to whether or not the saints should go to sporting events
Some said that those who do not go to sporting events are under a legality and that those who go are liberated
Regardless of whether or not you think the saints should go, as long as you do not have Christ, whatever you do is a religion
We should not have a religion that says we should not go, nor should we have a religion that says we should go
Because Christianity is void of Christ, many things other than Christ, such as rules and regulations, have come in
When he was in the meetings, he would speak or pray in only two or three meetings out of ten; the rest of the time he was silent
If we walk in Christ and live Christ day by day, we will be saturated with Christ, possess Christ, and be full of Christ
Suppose a brother quarrels with his wife at home, and then he comes to the meeting and shouts, 'Praise the Lord'!
When we come together, we can display the Christ whom we experience for His glory, for others' edification, and for the enemy's shame
Having the proper church life depends entirely upon how much Christ we have-how much oil we have and how much light we shine out
Just as man cannot live physically without unceasing breathing, as believers, we cannot live without unceasing prayer
In order to pray properly, we simply need to go to the Lord to contact Him and allow Him to initiate what we pray about
It is best not to try to compose anything but rather to simply use the words of the Bible for the words of our prayer
It is difficult to know when the weather will be cloudy, when it will be clear, when it will snow, or when it will rain
We simply need to do our duty to contact the Lord each morning by ten minutes of pray-reading and five minutes of prayer
Every state church is an organization with a head that replaces Christ and is thus an insult to the headship of Christ
Besides the state churches there are private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church
Not only so, the Bible also tells us that on the cross in the flesh Christ destroyed Satan, the one who has the might of death
Through Christ's incarnation He became a man, and by His death on the cross He defeated Satan and destroyed God's enemy
In the Old Testament the king was the head of God's people because the headship of Christ was not yet completed
In the Old Testament there was always only one king at a time, but in the New Testament there were twelve apostles at the same time
In every record of the names of the twelve apostles in the four Gospels, Peter's name always stands as the first
The full record in the New Testament reveals that although Peter was first, he was not an official first or a permanent first
The Catholic Church claims that Peters name always stands first in the New Testament but Galatians 29 mentions James and Cephas and John
Although Peter was one of the elders in Jerusalem , James was the only elder named in Acts 21:18, and Peter was included in 'all the elders'
From these verses we can see that the final word at the end of the conference was given not by Peter but by James
In human terms, James presided over that conference and gave the concluding word because at that time he was taking the lead
For the Jews to eat with the Gentiles was a violation of their Mosaic Law, yet Peter was bold to eat with the Gentile believers
God does not desire to have permanent leaders in the New Testament age, for such leaders are an insult to the headship of Christ
In another matter a different brother may have the highest capacity; therefore, in that matter he will be the leader
Peter, who was an elder himself, wrote to the elders, 'Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
He may want to know whether or not he should go swimming at the beach, participate in sports, go to movies, or drink beer
Even if we know the answer to your question, we still cannot answer you because we do not have the position to tell you what to do
Failing to honor Christ as the Head could be the reason that a husband and wife who pray together still may not know the Lord's will
On one hand, they pray to the Lord; on the other hand, they may not give the headship to the Lord, respecting the Lord as their Head
Regrettably, this concept damaged Jerusalem, for it was one reason that God sent Titus and the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem in A
A clever brother among us may exercise his influence and say, 'It is foolish for all the churches to be scattered, loose, and unorganized
The United States of America is strong because the fifty states are organized into a federal government with a president'
The Bible never tells us which of these two regions was higher, nor does the Bible show that the two regions merged into one
All this shows that there should be no organization among God's people in order that there would be no head other than Christ
In the last few years there has been a trend among us to organize the local churches in a way that will lead to hierarchy
The issue of who is to take the lead at any time is always determined by the spiritual situation at any given time
Practicing in this way keeps God's people away from the kind of leadership that insults the headship of Christ
Perhaps one day a brother in this locality will say, 'Among the three elders, Brother So-and-so is number one'
Having a plurality of elders is according to the truth, but deciding which one is first is not according to the truth'
Just as the citizens of the United States know the basic items of the Constitution, so we who are in the churches should know the truth
Regardless of who comes to us, if he says something different from the truth in the Bible, we need to say, 'Brother, we cannot take this'
If even the angels or the apostles preach to us another gospel, we should not receive it, because the truth in the Bible has been completed
The church will be strong because the church life will not be practiced according to man's opinion or concept but according to the truth
Question: Could you comment further on what a husband should do to honor the headship of Christ if his wife asks him to make a decision?
When something is referred to the elders, if they immediately make a decision and give an order, this is an insult to the Head
If a body is weak and collapsing because of a lack of food, we should not rely on something organizational to prop it up
For a carpenter to replace the top of a desk takes only a short time, but for a body to fully recover from surgery requires a long time
Whatever we do with the church must be organic, depending not on our doing but on the organic function of the Body
Answer: On one hand, among the Lord's people today there should be no head; the headship belongs uniquely to Christ
We keep a good order in the church, but the leading ones are not the lords-they refer all the things to the Lord
Question: If there is not a clear answer from the Lord when we refer something to Him, should we simply choose as best we can?
If, however, there is nothing forcing us to do something right away, it is better to wait until we are clear concerning the Lord's will
Question: In 1 Corinthians 7:25 and 40 Paul's opinion became the word of God, but many times our opinions are natural
If we are not filled with the Spirit, we are filled with our natural concepts, and whatever we say will not be of the Lord
Because there is a situation of confusion and division in the church today, we too need to know how to conduct ourselves in the church
In the New Testament to teach the law is to teach something different from the teaching of the gospel, the teaching of God's economy
These verses indicate that although there are different gifts and functions, there is only one work and one ministry
Although Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote concerning the Lord's life on the earth, they did not repeat one another's writing
Today in the New Testament economy we all need to speak the same thing, but this does not mean that what we speak is all from the same angle
In the New Testament age God has raised up many gifted persons with many gifts and functions, but they all belong to the same one ministry
They do not minister the law or their own concepts, ideas, or opinions; rather, they all minister Christ for the church
Verse 2 does not say that God spoke in the apostles; rather, it says that He spoke in the Son, for all the apostles are members of the Son
The fact that Christ is one body with many members proves that in the New Testament age there is only one ministry
In the New Testament age the twelve apostles, Paul, Barnabas, Luther, and Brother Nee have all been constituted into the Son
To speak differently is not to speak different aspects of the same thing; it is to speak different categories of teaching
Apparently, there are four categories of teaching mentioned in 1 Timothy 1: God's economy, the law, myths, and genealogies
The Old Testament things of the law are not aspects of God's economy and are different from the apostles' teaching
A good Bible teacher may come along who does not teach from the Old Testament but teaches from the New Testament
We know that foot-washing is not part of God's economy, because teaching it will immediately produce questionings
By speaking only once concerning a different teaching, he will open the door for all the saints to begin to talk about the matter
If the sisters wash the other sisters' feet just once, they will be humbled and will open themselves to the other sisters
Whenever someone presents a particular teaching among us even one based on the New Testament we need to ask Does this belong to Gods economy
We may realize that, rather than ministering Christ, it produces questions and opens the door for different opinions
The ministry in God's New Testament economy speaks only of Christ for the church and ministers Christ as life to the church
Tozer concludes that although many are working for Christ, the headship of Christ is entirely set aside and denied in all of Christianity
The brother who formed this coordination surely will eventually become a head, insulting the headship of Christ
By producing distracting questionings, this kind of coordination robs the saints of their moment-by-moment contact with the Lord in prayer
As we saw in the previous chapter if a younger brother comes to us for fellowship we need to be careful not to insult the headship of Christ
We may have a good intention and a good heart to help the brother, but our good intention insults the headship of Christ
They studied how often to have the Lord's table, who is qualified to participate in the Lord's table, and how to serve the bread and the cup
We see also that the bread is a loaf composed of fine flour made from many grains of wheat, which displays Christ's Body in resurrection
Romans 6:3-4 says, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
There are many doctrines in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, but within the doctrines there is the truth, the reality
The way to conduct ourselves in the church in a time of degradation is to know the truth and to bear the truth
If we know the truth, we will not care for doctrines such as whether wine or grape juice should be served at the Lord's table
At the Lord's table we should care only for the truth of the death and resurrection of Christ and the Body of Christ
If we have seen the truth of the one loaf, which signifies the one Body, we will never dare to make any division
If we dispute concerning the doctrine of what kind of bread to use, the more we dispute, the more we will be divided
When we baptize new believers, we need to put them into the death of Christ, not merely into a certain kind of water
On the other hand, if we care for the truth, we will realize that we need to pray and exercise our spirit when we baptize someone
Christ's ascension, His being taken up in glory, preceded His being preached among the nations and believed on in the world
Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but today the church is also the manifestation of God in the flesh
If we try to argue with them, we will fall into their snare and be clouded because they are skillful in arguing
Regardless of how eloquent the speaking is or how enticing the words are, if the teaching and the words are not healthy, we must reject them
Rather we need to simply take care of the four basic solid items of Gods economy the truth godliness and healthy words and healthy teaching
