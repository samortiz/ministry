BASED UPON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Does a person still need the outpouring of the Holy Spirit after experiencing the cross?</em></p>
<p>Answer: After experiencing the cross, we still need the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. However, when we have an adequate amount of experience of the cross, we will no longer need to plead for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This does not mean that the outpouring, the outward filling, of the Holy Spirit is unrelated to our praying in spirit; the two are closely related. If we experience the cross and pray more in spirit, we will not need to pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit will certainly be poured out. We will not need to pray for the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, but we will have the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. We will not wait for the feeling that the Spirit has been outpoured before we preach the gospel. Rather, we will speak by the Spirit and others will spontaneously sense power coming out from us. We must have the experience of the cross and then receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit based on this experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF THE CROSS<br />
BEING THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p><em>Question: How does the experience of the cross relate to the dividing of the soul and the spirit? What is the experience of the cross? Is it the all-inclusive death of Christ that becomes the experience of the cross in us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we see what it means to be in Christ, to die and be raised with Christ, and to have the move of the Holy Spirit in us, we will know what it is to be under the Holy Spirit. If we see this, we will know clearly what is of ourselves and what is of the spirit. Here the spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to our human spirit. Our spirit is connected to our soul. Only when we are under the cross will we be able to discern what is of the spirit and what is of the soul.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He always stood on the position of denying the self. For example, His brothers in the flesh said to Him, &ldquo;Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing; for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world&rdquo; (John 7:3-4). His brothers in the flesh thought that He should go and keep the feast in Jerusalem, instead of hiding Himself, so as to manifest Himself to the world. But the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready...I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled&rdquo; (vv. 6, 8). When He was on earth, He completely put Himself to death. This was to bear the cross. Eventually, He was crucified. Before His crucifixion, He told the Father, &ldquo;Not as I will, but as You will...If this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done&rdquo; (Matt. 26:39, 42). Hence, the ultimate purpose of the cross in us is the will of God; it is to rid us of our self and to let God and His will be fulfilled in us.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He lived in death until He went to the cross to fully accomplish death. When we are saved, Christ enters into us with the demand of death, requiring us to be freed from the self through His death. If we receive the demand of His death, we will receive the cross, that is, we will experience the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHINING OF GOD KILLING OUR SELF</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the difference between death and the demand of death?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In experience, the demand of death is death itself. If we have not had this experience, we will think that death and the demand of death are two separate items. If we tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I am willing to let You live out from me,&rdquo; immediately the demand of death will be upon us. Our self may be very strong, but when the demand of death comes, the strong self will be terminated. Soon after praying such a prayer, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking will come to show that we still have the self in certain aspects. We may immediately say, &ldquo;O Lord, yes.&rdquo; At this time we may still rely on the self, but death continues to kill the particular aspect that the Lord has pointed out. What we experience may be only a small &ldquo;surgery,&rdquo; a small enlightening. When Paul encountered the great light, all of his being was terminated; his flesh, natural man, and self were not able to rise up. God&rsquo;s shining kills our self; this is the experience of the cross, but there is a difference in degree with different people.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
