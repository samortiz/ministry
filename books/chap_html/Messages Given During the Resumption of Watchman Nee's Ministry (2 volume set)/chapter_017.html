These two chapters mention many things concerning the laws. Last night we spoke of some basic matters. Tonight we will speak concerning an even more basic matter. This basic matter is the law. In order for a Christian to know God, he has to understand the laws. May the Lord open our eyes to see what a law is.</P><P>Paul mentioned a number of laws in Romans 7 and 8. When I was saved more than twenty years ago, I came across this passage, and I did not know what a law was. After more than ten years, I still did not understand what it was. Romans 7 and 8 mention the laws repeatedly. Bible students all agree that the book of Romans occupies a very important place in the Bible. It can be considered one of the most important books of the New Testament. In this book, the most important chapters are chapters five to eight. With chapters five to eight, the key word is "law." If a man does not know what a law is, his spiritual life will be confused.</P><P>A law is a natural force. For example, if I throw a book up in the air, it will surely fall down. I do not have to worry about whether or not it will fall down, and I do not have to help it fall down. There is a law that controls it and compels it to fall down. Every life has its natural ability. I dare not say that every law is a life, but I can say that every life is a law. If I plant a chrysanthemum seed in the ground, I do not have to pray, fast, or worry; what grows up will surely be a chrysanthemum flower. Are we breathing, speaking, and sleeping today? Breathing, speaking, and sleeping are the laws of the body. I do not have to exercise my will to breathe a certain number of times a minute, or to exercise my mind to consider if I have digested the food I have eaten. These things do not require the intervention of my mind and will. The more I exercise my will to digest, the more I become nervous, and the less I will be able to digest. Digestion is a law of life, a natural ability. If I hit you in the eye with my hand, your eyelids will spontaneously close; this is a law.</P>
