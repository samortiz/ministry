   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSECRATION BRINGING IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SINGLENESS IN SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to tell the young brothers and sisters that whatever they do in the future, whether they will be a teacher or a doctor, they can only do it as a secondary occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every one of us lives for the purpose of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why do we tell people to offer up their possessions?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is because without offering up our possessions, we can never serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord says that a man cannot serve two masters; he cannot serve God and mammon at the same time Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The colt must be loosed Matt 21:2 , and everything has to be offered up and released before a person can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who are not loosed cannot serve.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If anyone asks me how much he should offer, I would answer, "Everything."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Lee said that the church will lay aside the consecrated things for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what would you do if the church does not lay them aside for you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to serve God, we have to serve Him in a desperate way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY It Being God Honoring Us</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Granting Us the Favor</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was in England, I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once someone gave a book written by him to the Queen of England.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Queen read the book and was helped by it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Coates wrote eight books altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, "Coates has eight books.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why wouldn't he give the other seven books to the Queen also?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They acted as if I had said something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later I asked some other people and found out that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if you were to try to give her a book, she might not necessarily accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Consecration is God honoring us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a favor we grant to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, it is God's acceptance of us and of our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, it is God's honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not granting Him a favor; He is granting us a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For God to accept a person such as we are is the greatest privilege He grants to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I kneel before God and He sends a fire to consume the sacrifice, it is His favor to us in accepting my service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man thinks that he is sacrificing himself by consecrating himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Little does he realize that for God to accept him is His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why do we have to calculate so much?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to learn to push our way through to serve Him, to crawl before Him, and to kneel before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man ought to learn to humble himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not begging you to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, you should beg to go to Him yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Serving God Being to Our Profit and Being</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>the Result of the Lord's Dynamic Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the China Textile Corporation no longer dares to issue any more shares because, once it issues them, they will be sold out within half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, the blind ones are not the ones who cannot see; the blind ones are the ones who do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our only fear is that we give too little to God, that God does not accept what we give to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is our consecration a profit for God, or is it a profit for us?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is it a favor we render to God, or a favor God renders to us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to God, the only thing we fear is that God will reject us and deny us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We only fear that we give to God too little, that He will not accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who know God will say, "Lord, here is some more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here is some more."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who have once seen the Lord can give half of what they have to the poor without any complaint.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord said to Zaccheus, "Today salvation has come to this house" Luke 19:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today, many people do not realize the greatness of the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why they encounter difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Salvation not only saves our soul; it means that we are delivered from everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us remember the story of our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why were we baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Baptism is a declaration that we have been separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Merely to invite three or five people to come and serve will not solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What we need to do today is for the whole Body to rise up for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The demand for the co-workers in the days ahead is quite severe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The need is also very great.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the sake of China's gospel, for the sake of the co-workers going on, we need a fresh consecration.</S>
