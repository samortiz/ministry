   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING A VITAL PERSON, AN OVERCOMER,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PRAYING PERSON HAVING THE REAL BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR PRAYER, TO RESCUE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM ITS DEGRADATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to remember that our groups must be vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible talks about vital people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is an overcomer?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An overcomer is a vital person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then what is it to be vital so that we can be overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A vital person, an overcomer, is a praying person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must have the real burden for the real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recently, I told some co-workers that their prayer did not come out of any burden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we come together just to shout a few sentences, is this a burden of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is formality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a formal performance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen in a previous message that Brother Nee said we should not pray anything that is not real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many prayers that we pray actually are not prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are repetitions of statements according to our tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real burden of prayer is not a composition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the blind man prayed to the Lord, he did not pray a composed prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus asked him what he wanted, the blind man said, Lord, that I may receive my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 18:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is real prayer out of a real burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was burdened to contact Jesus so that he could see, and the Lord answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But our prayers mostly are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our prayers, even our personal prayers, are mostly a religious form and a kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we may ask, How can we be burdened for prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a matter of the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot forget the vital groups, because that is my real burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I cannot forget the Lord s recovery, because His recovery is my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I always have to pray to the Lord for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I pray and cry, O Lord, the recovery, this is out of some burden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we begin to pray for the recovery, we realize that we cannot finish our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many places and persons for which we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be vital, and to be vital is to have the real burden for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is the need of the real prayer among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What the vital groups should have a burden to pray is this: Lord, the church needs the proper increase.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of some rebellious ones who were among us, our number was damaged and our morale was spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we love the church, we should be desperate to pray, even to pray with fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our meetings should be full of real prayers, not formal prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should pray, Lord, we just cannot go on without the proper increase, especially among the Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of prayer is the real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not merely meet according to our schedule to fulfill a formal duty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The prayer of some among us is too traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no burden or desperation in their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The going on of the vital groups to gain the increase should be a life or death matter with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if we are not scheduled to meet, there should still be a burden in us to come together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I recently checked with some of the groups concerning what they were doing, but no one told me that they were praying desperately for the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead they told me about other activities in their groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I heard this, I was concerned that we were making the groups something that is not vital.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The vitality is not in your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The vitality is in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If someone asks you what you are doing in your group, it would be wonderful to hear you say, We just cannot live without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are desperate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everybody prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We only have the time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what I like to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must have some vital prayer with some vital burden.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to have the vital groups, we ourselves need to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to pray desperately, Lord, we ask You, when the season comes, to give each one of us two people who are remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Otherwise, we cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should pray and pray until the Lord answers our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not be discouraged or disappointed, but have the full assurance that He will fulfill His word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is because He told us that He has chosen us and set us to go forth to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you have this kind of prayer with a burden, every time you pray you will get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You will get the infilling Spirit and the outpoured Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our meetings should not be an empty performance but meetings full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our vital group training meeting is not a common meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a meeting for the overcomers to rescue the church from its degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the vital groups fail, there is no way for the Lord to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One brother recently told me that the vital groups really work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But I wondered if this brother really knew what he meant when he said this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not the vital groups work depends upon how much prayer you offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then you will have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will be a Spirit-filled person according to what Acts 13:52 says The disciples were filled...with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you are a person of prayer, you will be a person living, walking, and doing everything in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You will not be so loose and easily talk about others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You will be greatly limited, restricted, in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then you will have a real burden to produce fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You will contact people, and this will be very different from all your contacts in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are vital, your contacts will sense that something real is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, the people whom you contact will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you are vital, something of life will be ministered to the ones you contact.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>By this time we should have some gospel candidates in our consideration and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should have the assurance that by the end of the year, we will have one or two as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But this all depends upon how we spend these coming months.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The season for fruit is not today but in the months to come.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To have a human birth after conception takes nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To have the fruit on a vine takes about one year.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These are the laws in nature according to God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Even when God became incarnated, He stayed in the human womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He kept the law which He established in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I hope that my word here will encourage us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should be desperate for the Lord s interests on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We need to aspire to be the overcomers to rescue the church from its degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There is no verse in the New Testament which tells us that the closer we are to the Lord s coming, the better the church will be.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>On the contrary, the closer we are to the Lord s coming, the more degraded the church will become.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The victory will be with the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They will be raptured early, and they will be the ones who will consummate this age.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This age will be consummated only because of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Of course, we still need a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>No one can be an overcomer without a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you isolate yourself from the church and neglect the church, there is no way for you to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The book of Judges shows us that Israel became degraded to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But still that degraded nation of Israel kept a piece of land on which Christ could come to tread.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Without the degraded nation of Israel, that piece of land would not have been there.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Also, Israel produced Boaz and Ruth to bring forth Obed, who begot David s father, Jesse Matt 1:5-6 , and it also produced another couple, Mary and Joseph, to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The church may be defeated, but God can never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He has His way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We still need the church life that can maintain us in the overcoming life, but we should not be satisfied just to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>To be in the church is one thing, but to be in the church and to be an overcomer is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The vital groups need overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Even the vital groups need some vital groups within them to rescue them.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>After a little degradation, we are no longer vital.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Without prayer, without being in the Holy Spirit and your human spirit, you can never be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Do not think that if you attend all the vital group meetings, you are vital.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Being vital depends upon whether you are vital in prayer in the Holy Spirit and in your human spirit.</S>
