<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in April 1977, in Blackpool, England. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH, THE TOTALITY<br />
OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5, 7, 9, 20-23; 3:8-11, 14-21</h1>
<p>Ephesians reveals the eternal purpose of God. This Epistle is high, deep, and profound, and in it the apostle Paul uses extraordinary terms and expressions to utter what was on his heart. If we spend time to consider these expressions, we will know Paul&rsquo;s thought in this Epistle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHOSEN IN CHRIST TO BE<br />
HOLY AND WITHOUT BLEMISH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.&rdquo; God chose us, selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ. Our being chosen does not depend on what we are or what we do. It depends on what Christ is, what He has done, and what He will do for us. We should not look at ourselves. If we look at ourselves superficially, we may be proud, but if we consider ourselves in an honest way, we will be thoroughly disappointed. None of us is worthy of God&rsquo;s selection. However, God selected us, not in ourselves, in our situation, or in our sphere but in Christ as the means, the sphere, the condition, and the circumstance. Christ is everything for God&rsquo;s selection of us.</p>
<p>God selected us not only before we were born but also before the foundation of the world, even before the creation of the heavens, the earth, and Adam. Only God Himself was there in eternity past. When nothing had yet come into existence, God made a selection. A person can select only those things that he sees. This proves that in eternity past, even before we came into existence, God saw all of us. We may wonder how this can be. With human beings there is the matter of time. In all our homes we have clocks and watches; we are very much controlled by time. With God, however, there is no limitation of time. Eternity past, eternity future, and today are all the same to Him. In His eternal nature, God is unlimited. This is a wonderful matter. Our salvation was not an accident. It was something planned and purposed in eternity. In that plan God selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ.</p>
<p>God chose us to be holy and without blemish. A blemish is an imperfection. A good piece of wool, for example, may be free from any blemish in its color, texture, size, and design. According to our improper concept, we may think that God chose us in Christ to be free simply from perdition. Even until now this may be our subconscious thought. We may say, &ldquo;Thank the Lord. He chose me before the foundation of the world to be saved from perdition.&rdquo; However, this is not the Lord&rsquo;s thought. His thought is that we should be holy and without blemish. To be holy is to be separated unto God and for God. God has chosen us that we should be separated unto Him and for Him for His purpose and be without any blemish. God is a God of perfection. Anything that is imperfect has nothing to do with Him. However, we should look at Him, not at ourselves. We are not in ourselves; we are in Christ. In ourselves we are imperfect, but in Christ we are perfect. We all must believe this. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover us back to the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>We were chosen in Christ to be holy and without blemish. Because of our fallen state, our concept regarding our present, our future, and our ultimate destiny is always according to our situation. However, we must all declare that it is possible for us to be holy and without blemish. Sometimes the young people are not able to believe this. They often turn the question to me, asking, &ldquo;Do you believe that you can be holy and without blemish?&rdquo; With us this is impossible, but there is no impossibility with the Lord; with Him everything is possible (Matt. 19:26). If God could create us, can He not make us holy? To be sure, He can make us holy, perfect, and without blemish. Therefore, whether we are good or bad, wonderful or pitiful, or in heaven or in hell does not matter. We must not look at ourselves according to ourselves, and neither should we consider the brothers according to themselves. We all need to consider one another according to Christ. We need to say, &ldquo;This brother is holy and without blemish. I do not care to hear how unholy or worldly he is. One day he will be absolutely holy. If he is not holy today, he is in the process of becoming holy. God can do it, and He will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe that all the dear saints will be holy. They are holy brothers and holy sisters. In ourselves we are poor, unholy, and full of imperfections; therefore, we must look at one another according to Christ and say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, here is a brother in Christ.&rdquo; Because there is nothing unholy or imperfect in Christ, we are all holy in Him. If we do not believe this now, one day we will believe it. In the New Jerusalem we may look at one another and be surprised. We may recall the time that we considered one another and could not believe that we were holy. Then we will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, holy brother.&rdquo; Our being holy is not according to ourselves but according to Christ. The book of Ephesians is different from the book of Romans. The beginning of Romans reveals a pitiful situation in which we were all sinners and were all condemned (1:18&mdash;3:20), but in Ephesians 1 we are not condemned but chosen. Ephesians begins not with us but with God. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING PREDESTINATED UNTO SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; This is a deep matter. To be predestinated is to be pre-marked, marked out before we were born or even created. It is as if God saw us in eternity and said, &ldquo;I like this one.&rdquo; Before the foundation of the world, God looked at us, selected us, and put a mark on us. We cannot recognize the mark, but God and all His angels can. Wherever we go, all the angels can see that we are those who have been marked out by God. The so-called scientific people may say that this is a mere superstition. However, it is no superstition; it is a fact. Day and night there is a mark on us.</p>
<p>Again, according to the natural concept, many Christians may say that God has predestinated us unto salvation. I too held this concept for many years. I read Ephesians many times, but I did not see the divine sonship. However, one day the Lord opened my eyes to see the divine sonship. Salvation is easy to understand, but sonship is not. God predestinated us not merely for salvation but even more for sonship. Sonship means that God makes us His sons. Once we were only God&rsquo;s creation. At that time we were not born of Him, but now we are born of God (John 1:12-13). When I was young, Christian pastors and evangelists would tell us that we need God&rsquo;s salvation because we are fallen. In their thought, if we were not fallen, we would not need salvation. However, even if we had never sinned and fallen, we still would not be sons of God. At best, we would be a humanly perfect item of God&rsquo;s creation. God&rsquo;s intention is not simply to create us but to make us His sons. In God&rsquo;s predestination He marked us out in order to make us sons, those who are born of Him to have His life, nature, and all that He is. This is the proper meaning of sonship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Sonship<br />
Being a Corporate Entity</h2>
<p>The divine sonship is not merely an individual matter. It is not simply that you become one son of God, I become another son of God, and others become many other sons of God individually. Rather, the divine sonship is corporate. The Bible tells us that God has many sons. Originally, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son of God (v. 14, 18; 3:16; 1 John 4:9), but now He is the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6). Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and verse 11 says that Christ, the firstborn Son, is not ashamed to call them brothers. Today God has not only one Son but many sons corporately. A family is a corporate entity. All the brothers in a family should be one because they are all of one father. One person by himself cannot be a family. A bachelor, for example, has only himself, not an actual family. A couple with one child is a family, and a family like that of Jacob, who had twelve sons and one daughter, is a much greater family. The divine sonship is a corporate entity that eventually becomes the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Sonship Being<br />
the Mingling of God with Man</h2>
<p>The church is the totality of the divine sonship. Originally, Jesus Christ as the unique Son of God was the individual expression of God. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This expression of God by the individual Son, Jesus Christ, was a perfect expression, but it did not fulfill God&rsquo;s goal. God&rsquo;s goal is to have the totality of the divine sonship. As the redeemed, forgiven, saved, and regenerated sons of God, we have the divine nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4). Some may wonder how we as mere human beings can have the divine nature, and some have spoken evilly of this as an &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; Such a speaking is in darkness, without any revelation. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we receive revelation, we will see that God has put His divine nature into the believers. We may compare this to the addition of tea to a glass of plain water. When we place a tea bag into water, the tea becomes mingled with the water to become tea-water. Once tea is mingled with water, we no longer call it water; we call it tea. However, we do not mean that it is only tea. Rather, it is tea mingled with water.</p>
<p>According to the facts of the Bible, God has mingled His divine nature with us to make us divine. When plain water is saturated with tea to have the element, color, appearance, and taste of tea, we may say that the water is &ldquo;teaified.&rdquo; The water remains water, but now it is saturated with the tea. In the same way, when God puts Himself into us, He sanctifies us. Because we have been born of God, we now have God&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature. This does not mean we are no longer human. We are still human, but we are humanity mingled with divinity. We do not preach &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; God is God, and we are human beings. Nevertheless, God has put His divine nature into our being. Therefore, we are sons of God with the divine life and the divine nature. The divine life and the divine nature are the very elements of the divine sonship, which is the church. The church is not merely human; it also has the divine element. If we were all only human, we would not be the church. We would be a human society. The church is absolutely different from a human society or a religious organization. The church is something human, yet it is saturated and permeated with the divine nature. Because the church has the divine element, everything in it is holy and without blemish. Therefore, we should not look at ourselves. In ourselves we are unholy and full of blemishes. We must have a heavenly view. We have been chosen to be holy and without blemish, and we have been predestinated, pre-marked, to be the sons of God. This does not mean that from now on we are no longer human beings. We are still human beings, but another element has been added into our &ldquo;plain water&rdquo; to &ldquo;teaify us,&rdquo; that is, to sanctify us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br />
the Totality of the Divine Sonship,<br />
Having the Divine Life and Nature</h2>
<p>It is not easy to define what the church is. When I was young, I often heard about the church in our Sunday school class. At that time we thought that the church was simply a physical building that has a high tower with a bell in it. Today many people still understand the church in this way. Gradually, however, we found out that the church is not a physical building. Later on, we received an improved definition of the church from the teachers among the Brethren. They told us that the church is the gathering together of the believers. When the believers, the called ones, gather together, that is the church. This definition is according to the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> which is translated &ldquo;church.&rdquo; However, this is still a somewhat natural understanding of the church. According to the New Testament, the church is not only the meeting together of the believers. Rather, the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22b-23; 1 Cor. 12:27; Col. 1:18), and it is the totality of the sonship of all God&rsquo;s children. This sonship indicates that we possess the divine life and the divine nature.</p>
<p>According to our experience, we cannot deny that as human beings we do have the divine life and the divine nature. We do not mean that we are God Himself. We can never be God Himself; we will be human beings for eternity. Nevertheless, in our humanity there is the element of God&rsquo;s divinity. We in the church are still human, but there is another element within us, which is God Himself. If someone spills a glass of plain water on his shirt, it will not change the appearance of the shirt, but if the water has the element of tea in it, it will leave a brown color. In the same way, no one should touch us without being affected by the divine element within us. We can boast to Satan, saying, &ldquo;Satan, do not touch me. I am a son of God, and within me is another element&mdash;God&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by the Divine Life and the Divine Nature<br />
for the Corporate Expression of God<br />
in the Divine Sonship</h2>
<p>This church as the divine sonship requires us to gather together, not in our self but in the divine life and the divine nature. Whenever we come together, and even in our daily life, we should not live by ourselves. We need to live according to the extra element within us, the divine life and the divine nature. This is the reason that the Christian walk requires faith. To have faith is to believe in something that we cannot see, feel, or touch. We must all live according to something unseen (2 Cor. 4:18). In himself no one can be a perfect husband. Realizing this, a brother may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, help me to be a perfect husband.&rdquo; However, the Lord does not care to help us in this way. Rather, He wants us to forget about ourselves and live by Him. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;I can never be a perfect husband; therefore, I will forget about myself and not live by myself. Instead, I want to live by You.&rdquo; We are still a &ldquo;glass of water,&rdquo; but now our color, appearance, taste, and element have changed. In ourselves we are not good. If someone rebukes us and says that we are not a perfect husband, we can say, &ldquo;You are speaking the truth, but I am actually worse than this. I have nothing good in myself.&rdquo; Then we can say to the Lord, &ldquo;I do not ask You to help me to be good. Instead, I want to forget about myself. Thank You, Lord, that You are in me. I am no longer only water; I have the divine tea in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we can see that we are all &ldquo;teaified,&rdquo; that is, sanctified, the church will be rich, uplifted, and living. When someone drinks tea-water, he cares mainly for the tea, not for the water. We are still &ldquo;water,&rdquo; but we have an additional element with its color, appearance, and taste. The church is not a religion, a society, or a social body. Therefore, it does not serve people with mere &ldquo;water&rdquo; or with &ldquo;dry tea.&rdquo; People cannot take tea by itself. In order to take tea, it must be mingled with water. If someone looks at a glass of plain water, he may say that there is no tea, but if he has a glass of tea-water, he will see the tea. Likewise, some people today say that there is no God. They should not say this. If they would come to the church, they will see God. When we meet together as the church, we must have the element, color, appearance, and taste of God. After people attend our meeting, they should not say, &ldquo;I saw some American people, British people, young people, and older people.&rdquo; To see only this much is meaningless. Rather, they should say, &ldquo;I cannot explain what impressed me in that meeting. I did not even care for that way of meeting, but I received something there that I cannot deny.&rdquo; What people must receive in our meetings is God Himself (1 Cor. 14:24-25). This is the meaning of the church as the divine sonship.</p>
<p>In the past fifty years I have seen many cases like this. Sometimes the parents of a young person did not want their son or daughter to be involved with the church life, but once the parents started coming to the church meetings, they received the &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo; In this way, many parents eventually took the way of the church. This is our experience in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Christianity today is a religion that offers a limited concept of salvation, but the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to bring us back to the living sonship. Here we do not care for mere opinions or concepts. Rather, we are all drinking &ldquo;tea-water&rdquo; and serving others with it. In this message I have used the illustration of tea-water because the spiritual reality that it points to is mysterious, abstract, and profound, and we do not have the adequate vocabulary in our human language to express it. We all must have a heavenly vision. Today we praise the Lord that we are saved, forgiven, and redeemed. However, we are also the sons of God. We have the divine sonship with the divine life and the divine nature within us. We are not God Himself, but we do have God&rsquo;s life and nature. Therefore, God lives in us, and we can live by God. This is not merely to be saved, forgiven, and redeemed. It is altogether a matter of the divine sonship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH THROUGH<br />
THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; 13:44-46; Eph. 5:25-27; 2:15-16; John 12:24; 20:17-22; Heb. 2:11-12</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have the church. Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship.&rdquo; The church is the totality of the divine sonship, which is a corporate, not an individual, matter. In this chapter and the next we will consider how the church is produced and built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH TODAY BEING<br />
THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew speaks much concerning the church. The first mention in the Bible of the word <em>church</em> is in Matthew 16. Verse 18 speaks of the church, and verse 19 mentions the kingdom. In these two verses <em>church</em> and <em>kingdom</em> are used interchangeably, showing that in the view of this Gospel, the church is the kingdom, and the kingdom is the church. The proper church life today is the kingdom of the heavens. These are two aspects of one entity.</p>
<p>Matthew begins with two wonderful, precious names: Jesus, which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; and Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (1:21-23). About thirty-three years after His birth, this Jesus brought His disciples close to the border of the Holy Land. There He asked His disciples who men said that He was. Peter received a vision to see who Christ is. He answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (16:16). Immediately, Jesus told Peter, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). It is as if the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Peter, you have seen the vision of Christ, but now I will reveal to you something further. To see only Christ is not sufficient. You must see another part of the heavenly vision. The heavenly vision includes not only Christ but also the church.&rdquo; Christ and the church are the two sections of the spiritual mystery (Eph. 5:32) and the heavenly vision (Acts 9:1-5; 26:19).</p>
<p>Matthew 16:19 continues, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Most fundamental teachers agree that there were two keys. Peter used one key to open the door for the Jews on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:38-42), and he used the other to open the door to the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius (10:34-48). We can never separate the kingdom from the church. The teaching of the Brethren is too dispensational, stating that the age of grace is the age of the church, not of the kingdom, and that the age of the kingdom will be the next age. According to this teaching, when Christ came, He brought the kingdom with Him, but when the Jews rejected Christ, the kingdom was suspended and will remain suspended until Christ returns with the kingdom. Therefore, today we are in the church but not in the kingdom. However, according to the New Testament, the kingdom has not been suspended. In Acts 1:3, for example, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples after His resurrection, and for a period of forty days He spoke to them concerning the kingdom, not the church specifically; yet what was produced and established in the book of Acts was the church. This proves again that <em>kingdom</em> and <em>church</em> are interchangeable terms, denoting different aspects of one entity. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Romans 14 is a chapter on the proper church life, but it speaks concerning the kingdom of God today. Again, this indicates that the kingdom is the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A TREASURE HIDDEN IN THE FIELD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16 we first see the church, but we do not see the details of what the church is. The Bible is wonderful, and it does not always give us all the details about a matter in one place. Rather, it reveals a small portion in one place and another portion in another place. We may compare this to a jigsaw puzzle. We do not keep the pieces of a puzzle in a meaningless pile. Rather, we need adequate time and wisdom to put all the pieces together in a significant way. Do not ask the reason that the Lord reveals His mysteries in the divine Word in such a puzzle-like way. This is simply the case. To see more concerning the church and the kingdom, we must consider the parables in Matthew 13. The seven parables in chapter 13 are in three groups. The first four are one group. These parables speak of food. In the first parable, a sower went out to sow some seeds to grow wheat, and in the second parable, tares were sown in the field as false food. The third parable concerns a mustard seed, and the fourth parable speaks of leaven hidden by a woman in fine flour. This group of four parables denotes that the church as the kingdom of God on the earth today produces something that is good to eat.</p>
<p>The second group of parables is the parable of the treasure hidden in the field (v. 44) and the parable of a merchant buying a fine pearl (vv. 45-46). Just as the first four parables refer to things that are grown, this pair of parables speaks of things that are transformed. The treasure hidden in the field must be composed of gold or precious stones. Both precious stones and pearls are transformed materials. First Corinthians 3:9 says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; The farm is for growing, and the building is built with precious materials (v. 12a). Therefore, the first group of parables in Matthew 13 is for growing, and the second group is for transformation. The third group is a single parable, the parable of the net (vv. 47-50).</p>
<p>The treasure in verse 44 is hidden in the field, and the pearl in verse 46 comes out of the sea. In typology, a field signifies the earth created by God for His kingdom. This is indicated in Genesis 1:26-29, which says that God created man to express God and exercise His dominion over all the creatures, and the restored earth grew the things that were good for man to live on. This means that the earth is something positive used by God to exercise His kingdom in the universe. The sea, on the other hand, signifies the people in the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15). The four beasts in Daniel 7 signify the kings of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire. These great evil men came from the stormy sea, the Gentile world (vv. 2-3). Likewise, in Revelation 13 Antichrist also comes up out of the Gentile world, represented by the sea (v. 1). Therefore, it is very meaningful that the treasure in Matthew 13 is hidden in the field, and the pearl comes out of the sea. This means that the treasure in the field is the kingdom of God on His created earth. We should not be disappointed and think that God has given up the earth. Regardless of how rotten, corrupt, dark, and evil the world is today, we can be assured that one day the earth will be cleared up, all the evil things will be swept into the universal trash can, the lake of fire, and the Lord will set up His kingdom on the cleared-up earth. This day is close at hand. Today the Lord is sweeping through this earth in judgment, not by water but by fire. Eventually the earth as the field will be a good place for His kingdom. Today, however, the kingdom is hidden in the field.</p>
<p>The treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom as an aspect of the church. In the eyes of God, the church is a precious treasure. The man who bought the field is Christ. Christ found the treasure and in His joy went to the cross to sell all that He had and buy not only the treasure but the entire field, redeeming the created and lost earth for God&rsquo;s kingdom. Now the earth is not only created by God but also purchased by Christ. The grand title deed of the earth is now in Christ&rsquo;s hand. It is not too much to say this. In Revelation 5:1-7 the scroll that Christ takes from God&rsquo;s hand is the new covenant, the grand title deed in the universe, enacted with the blood of the Lamb (Matt. 26:28). Christ is the unique One who is fully entitled and qualified to take that deed, because He was the One who fully paid the price for it. Only someone who pays for something has the right to its deed. Christ alone is the proper Owner. He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom will be exercised on it. Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.&rdquo; Every inch of this earth belongs to Christ. We do not agree that any part of the earth belongs to anyone else. All others are usurpers; Christ is the unique Owner. Moreover, He is coming back to claim the earth (10:1-2). Then He will say to all the usurpers, &ldquo;Who are you? Go to your place in the lake of fire.&rdquo; If we truly know the New Testament, we will see this clearly. Wherever I have traveled, I have said, &ldquo;This is my Lord&rsquo;s property. Temporarily it is usurped by the enemy, but one day my Lord will come to claim what is His.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we can see what the church is. The church is a treasure hidden in the field. Most people cannot see it. They cannot believe that in their own locality there is a treasure. This treasure is the church. The outward, apostate church is fully manifested, but one day it will come to nothing. The genuine church, on the other hand, is hidden yet solid. Only those who have the vision can see the church, which is solid, precious, and worthy yet hidden.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE FINE PEARL OF GREAT VALUE</h2>
<p>The church is also the fine pearl of great value. The pearl is not hidden in the sea; instead, it comes out of the sea. This is another aspect of the church. Both precious stones and pearls are transformed items. Precious stones are formed from a created substance that is subjected to high pressure and heat, and a pearl is formed from an oyster that is wounded by a small piece of sand. As the grain of sand stays in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it, causing it to become a pearl. This is a picture of Christ as the living oyster coming into the world, the sea, being wounded by us, the sinners, and secreting His life over us in His resurrection to make us precious pearls for the building of the church. The church comes into being through regeneration as the issue of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). The church has been regenerated, and it has also been transformed. On the one hand, it is a pearl formed by regeneration in the Gentile world, and on the other hand, it is a transformed precious stone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST GIVING HIMSELF UP FOR THE CHURCH<br />
IN ORDER TO SANCTIFY HER,<br />
CLEANSING HER BY<br />
THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In order for the church to be produced as the treasure and the pearl for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, Christ undertook four steps: He was crucified to pass through death, He resurrected, He ascended to the throne, and now He dwells within us. Thus, Christ today is the crucified Christ, the resurrected Christ, the ascended Christ, and the indwelling Christ. We may consider that Christ was crucified in order to take away our sins. This thought is true, but it is inadequate. Ephesians 5:25-27 says, &ldquo;Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo; This corresponds with Matthew 13, in which Christ found a fine pearl and went to the cross to pay the price for it. Christ died on the cross to purchase the church because He loved the church.</p>
<p>Moreover, Christ died on the cross in order to sanctify and cleanse the church to make her holy and without blemish. Verse 4 of Ephesians 1 tells us that we were chosen to be holy and without blemish, but this verse does not show us the way to be holy. The way is through the cross of Christ in chapter 5. Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her in order to sanctify and cleanse the church. To sanctify the church is to make it holy, and to cleanse the church is to make it without blemish. This is accomplished by the washing of the water in the word. This is very profound. If we mean business with the Lord, we will be in the church and under the washing of the water in the word. Even now as we are dealing with the word, the word is washing us. Because He loved the church, Christ died on the cross so that the church may be sanctified to be holy and cleansed to be perfect by the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<p>In order to have the church as a perfect pearl, Christ had to die on the cross. Through His death we have been redeemed, and through His blood we have been forgiven (v. 7). This brings us back to the position where He can work on us. Consequently, we are now under the washing of the living water in the word to wash away our spots and wrinkles. Wrinkles are due to oldness, and spots come from scars or wounds. Spiritually speaking, we are all old. Even the young people are old and full of wrinkles, and often they express this in their speaking, indicating that they have already passed through many things that have caused them to be old and full of wrinkles, spots, hurts, and wounds. Spots and wrinkles do not signify sins or worldliness. They signify something of the natural life. In order to have the church as the perfect pearl, Christ needed to die on the cross so that we might be redeemed back to a situation in which we can participate in the washing of the living water in the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST HAVING ABOLISHED<br />
THE ORDINANCES ON THE CROSS<br />
FOR THE PRODUCING AND LIVING<br />
OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 and 16 say, &ldquo;Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&rdquo; Christ has abolished not only sins, the world, wrinkles, and spots but also ordinances, regulations, rules, rituals, manners, and forms of living. Different peoples all have their various ways of living. The strongest ordinances are those that distinguish between the Jews and the Gentiles, but even the Japanese, Chinese, Germans, British, and Americans all have their own ways. The American way is close to the British way, but there are still great differences that cause the two to be sometimes at enmity. All these ways are ordinances. Through my traveling in America, I discovered that there are differing ordinances even among the Texans, New Yorkers, Californians, and New Englanders. In some places white Christians do not meet together with black Christians. None of these different peoples are able in themselves to come together in peace. Nevertheless, God has chosen some from all these peoples with the intention to build them together as one new man.</p>
<p>A certain ballad begins, &ldquo;East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.&rdquo; Today, however, we say that East is no longer East, and West is no longer West; East and West now fit together by the cross of Christ. On the cross Christ not only took away our sins, crucified our natural man, dealt with Satan, and destroyed the world, but He also slew the ordinances and rituals. All the hindrances, different ways of life, and different rituals, customs, manners, and ordinances have been abolished on the cross.</p>
<p>Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to Ephesians 2:15. If we asked what Christ accomplished on the cross, many would say that He took away our sins. Certain Christians who are deeper in the Lord may say that Christ defeated Satan and destroyed the world. Some who are even deeper may say that Christ not only took away our sins and destroyed Satan and the world but also crucified our old man. However, not many would say anything further. For the sake of the church life, we must all see that on the cross another item was dealt with&mdash;not only sins, the world, Satan, our flesh, and our old man but also our way of living. We must all forget our particular customs; otherwise, we cannot be the new man.</p>
<p>Christ abolished, slew, all the ordinances on the cross so that He might create of two peoples, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, one new man. Naturally speaking, in certain places I do not like to eat the food people serve, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I have learned to pass through the death of the cross and eat any kind of food. According to their ordinances, the Jews do not like to eat pork, but the Chinese often eat pork. How then can Jewish and Chinese believers come together at one table? The wisdom of man is to form a Jewish church and a Chinese church. This is what has happened today. In New York there is a Chinese church, and in China there is the Church of England. It is impossible to have the new man in this way. The church has fallen from the proper situation into many divisions. Therefore, we thank the Lord that we have the cross. The cross has crossed out not only sins, the world, Satan, our flesh, our old man, and our old nature but also the ordinances.</p>
<p>Some may say that the living of the new man is too difficult to practice. This is why we need the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The church is produced and built up through the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross, on which He crossed out every difference between the various peoples. Christ&rsquo;s death is basic for the producing of the church. We may think that our sins, the world, our old man, and our old nature all need to be dealt with, but we may never have realized that there is another category of negative things&mdash;our ordinances and manner of life. All these also have been dealt with.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE MANY GRAINS<br />
TO FORM A LOAF FOR GOD&rsquo;S FOOD<br />
AND MAN&rsquo;S SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Originally, Christ was the unique grain. However, no one can make a loaf of bread with a single grain. A loaf requires many grains. One grain of wheat becomes many grains by falling into the earth and dying. Christ needed to die so that He as the one grain could produce many grains to form the one loaf. Christ&rsquo;s death was necessary for the producing of the church, not merely because we, the chosen people of God, were involved with sins and the world and were troubled by Satan, self, the natural man, and ordinances, but because we needed to become the many grains. The only way for us to be the many grains was for Christ to die so that He as the one grain could be multiplied. Now we, the many grains, are the members of the church and the constituents of the Body of Christ. We are no longer sinners or people of the world. We are the many grains, which are good to form a loaf for God&rsquo;s food and people&rsquo;s satisfaction (1 Cor. 10:17). This is what the church is, and this is what the death of Christ has accomplished. The death of Christ has dealt with every negative thing and has produced the many grains for the one loaf, the church.</p>
<p>We must all see a clear vision that all the negative things that we were born into have been dealt with by Christ. There is no longer anything negative to frustrate the church life. All these things have been abolished, slain, crucified, and dealt with thoroughly on the cross. Not only so, but Christ&rsquo;s death has also made us the many grains. We are no longer sinners but grains good to form a loaf for God&rsquo;s food and man&rsquo;s satisfaction. This is what the church is. We can test whether or not a group of Christians is the church by checking whether or not they satisfy people&rsquo;s inner hunger. Only the loaf, constituted of the many grains, can satisfy people&rsquo;s hunger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE MANY SONS OF GOD<br />
AND THE MANY BROTHERS OF CHRIST<br />
THROUGH CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Early on the day of His resurrection, Jesus told Mary the Magdalene, &ldquo;Go to My brothers&rdquo; (John 20:17). At that time Jesus called the disciples &ldquo;My brothers.&rdquo; <em>Brothers</em> is a great title. Before His resurrection the disciples were His followers, not His brothers. At best, they were His friends (15:14-15). This is because before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection the disciples were not yet regenerated; that is, they were not yet the many grains. Before His resurrection Christ was the unique grain, but after His resurrection this one grain became many grains, who are His brothers. As the unique grain, Christ was God&rsquo;s unique, only begotten Son (1:18), but through His death and resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). From eternity Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the second of the Triune God, in His divinity, but today He is also the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity. The word <em>firstborn</em> indicates that many sons are following. The multiplied grains produced by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10). Today God has many sons, and Christ has many brothers.</p>
<p>In John 20 we do not have the word <em>church,</em> but we do have the many brothers. In the evening of the day of resurrection Christ came to His disciples (vv. 19-22). Hebrews 2:11 and 12 refer to the same event. These verses say, &ldquo;For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, &lsquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rsquo;&rdquo; The brothers of Christ are the church, and the church is constituted with the many brothers of Christ. By this we can see that the church is produced by both the death and resurrection of Christ. We are the sons of God and the brothers of Christ by His death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH&rsquo;S LIVING BEING NOT<br />
IN THE NATURAL LIFE BUT IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The church is not something natural; rather, the church is in resurrection. Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection there was no church. The church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and today it lives in His resurrection. If we are still living in our natural life, we are not the church in practicality. No doubt, we are still Christ&rsquo;s brothers, but it is only when we live in the resurrection life, denying our natural life, that we are in the church practically. The death of Christ has abolished all negative things, and the resurrection of Christ has produced the many grains, the many brothers, and the many sons, who are the constituents of the church. Therefore, if we still live by our ordinances and natural ways, we are finished in relation to the church. We may be a religious body or a social organization, but we are not the church. The church is an entity that has been delivered from all negative things and produced and built up in resurrection. To be the church in resurrection is not a mere term; it must be our situation in our living. Day by day we do not live in our natural life. Instead, we walk, live, and have our being in resurrection.</p>
<p>This is not a mere doctrinal teaching; it is a matter of our real and living experience. Some people have asked, &ldquo;How can you say that you are the church?&rdquo; We may illustrate the answer with a lamb and a turtle. A lamb has the life, nature, appearance, and living of a lamb. If another animal has the appearance and living of a turtle, it must be a turtle, not a lamb. This shows that in order to be the church, we must have the appearance and living of the church. We must truly see that we have been regenerated and that all the negative things&mdash;sins, worldliness, Satan, the flesh, the old man, the natural life, and all the ordinances&mdash;have been dealt with on the cross. We must also realize that the church is not natural; it is altogether of and in the resurrection life. We must have our living in resurrection.</p>
<p>Christianity has become a religion of doctrines, and many in it do not care for the genuine experience of Christ in resurrection. Recently, a brother testified that when he told his grandmother that she needed to have Christ in her heart, she showed him a crucifix that she was wearing and said that Christ was already &ldquo;on her heart.&rdquo; When the brother told her that Christ is present everywhere, his grandmother agreed and pointed to all her pictures of Jesus. This illustrates that Christians use the same terms that we do, but their &ldquo;lexicon&rdquo; is different. Accordingly, the word <em>church</em> means one thing to us, but it means something very different to many other people. Christianity has fallen into a religious condition, full of different doctrines, concepts, and opinions, and not many in it care for the living Christ. This is why we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not care for religion or for different teachings, concepts, and opinions. We care only for the living Christ. He is our God, He is the Son of God, and He became a man to live on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He died on the cross for our sins, and He was resurrected physically and spiritually. Now the resurrected Christ is in the heavens, and at the same time He is within us to be our life and our everything. Therefore, we care only for this living One. We live by Him and in Him, and we come together to have the church life with Him. This is the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not care for doctrinal teachings, organizations, rules, or practices. We have dropped all these things. We care only for the living Christ with the living, real, and practical church life, which is produced and built up by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH THROUGH<br />
THE ASCENSION AND INDWELLING OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph 1:19-23; 4:7-8, 11-16; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 1:16a; 2:20; 4:19; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is to have the church, and Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling are all for the producing and building up of the church. In the previous chapter we saw that the death of Christ dealt with all the negative matters. On the cross Christ took away our sins, and He dealt with Satan, even destroying him (John 1:29; Heb. 2:14). Christ also judged the evil world, and He crucified our old man, our natural life, and our flesh (John 12:31; Rom. 6:6; Matt. 16:24-25; Gal. 6:14; 5:24). Moreover, on the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances, the different manners of life, in order to create one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles (Eph. 2:15-16). Then in His resurrection Christ multiplied Himself as the one grain into many grains, which are His many brothers, the many sons of God (John 12:24; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12). Before the death of Christ, God had only one unique Son, the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. However, through His death and resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God. As the firstborn Son, He has many brothers, who are the many sons of God, the members of the Body of Christ. Because the Body of Christ is constituted with the many sons of God, the genuine church life is simply the totality of the divine sonship. The divine sonship is the church life, because every member of the church is a child of God, born anew with God&rsquo;s divine life and nature. The church is composed of the divine life and nature, which has been dispensed into all of us who are the children of God. All this was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. All the negative things are gone, and now we are the sons of God with God&rsquo;s divine life and nature. We have the divine sonship to be the church, the living Body of Christ (Eph. 1:5, 22-23).</p>
<p>In this chapter we will see how the church is built up by the ascension of Christ and by His indwelling. Christ is not only the crucified, resurrected, and living Christ; He is also the exalted, ascended, and indwelling Christ. He is exalted in the third heaven, and He is now indwelling His believers. This is what Christ is for the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S ASCENSION BEING IN<br />
THE SURPASSING GREATNESS OF GOD&rsquo;S POWER</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are the first two steps He took to produce the church. Following this, He ascended to the heavens. Not many Christians have a thorough realization of what Christ&rsquo;s ascension accomplished for the Body of Christ. Ephesians 1:19-23 reveals that the ascension and exaltation of Christ have very much to do with His Body. These verses say, &ldquo;What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Christ today is in the heavens, where He is exalted far above all (Phil. 2:9-11).</p>
<p>Landing men on the moon requires much power to overcome gravity. However, the moon is only one-quarter of a million miles from the earth. No one can measure the distance from the earth to the third heaven. For Christ to ascend to the third heaven required surpassingly great power. Moreover, as Christ was ascending from the Mount of Olives, the evil powers must have been fighting against Him. However, Christ simply ascended in the sight of all the disciples (Acts 1:9-11). This must have shocked the disciples. Ephesians 1:21 says that Christ ascended far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe, including not only the angelic, heavenly authorities but also the human, earthly ones. This means that in His ascension Christ overcame not only gravity and the demons on the earth but also the layer of fallen angels in the air to ascend all the way to the third heaven. Now Christ is there in the third heaven, and the earth, the demons, and all the principalities and powers in the air are under His feet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN HIS ASCENSION CHRIST BEING<br />
HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The surpassing power that God caused to operate in Christ also made Him Head over all things not merely for the church but to the church. Whatever Christ has obtained, attained, done, and will do are to the church. We may illustrate the meaning of <em>to the church</em> by considering electric lamps. In order for lamps to shine, whatever electricity is, has, and can do must come into them. Thus, the electric current is not only for the lamps but also to the lamps. We are the &ldquo;lamps,&rdquo; and the exalted Christ is the heavenly electricity. He has come out of death, ascended to the heavens, and been exalted far above all, and He has also been made Head over all things to the church. A person&rsquo;s head is not only for his body but to his body. This means that whatever the head is, has, and can do are transmitted to the body. Whatever Christ is, whatever He has, and whatever He can do are transmitted into the church, which is His Body.</p>
<p>The true position of the church is not on the earth but in the third heaven. On the one hand, our electric lamps are in our home, but according to the electricity within them, they are also in the power plant. The electricity connects the lamps to the power plant and the power plant to the lamps. According to our human feeling, we are surely on the earth, but the heavenly Christ connects us to the third heaven and the third heaven to us (John 1:51; Eph. 2:6). We need a proper vision. Our problem is that we often have a narrow view and say, &ldquo;The world is corrupt, the age is dark, and everything is disappointing. My home, school, work, and everyone around me are all no good. I want to be victorious, but I cannot make it, and the more I try to be holy, the more I become defiled.&rdquo; Instead, we all need to see the vision that Christ our Head has lifted us off the earth. Many years ago flying in an airplane was difficult, but today a large jet is safe and comfortable. The exalted Christ is our best &ldquo;jet.&rdquo; We must not look at ourselves or at the poor situation around us. We are not in our situation; we are in the third heaven. All the &ldquo;insects, snakes, and scorpions&rdquo; on the earth create a poor environment, but we are sitting in the third heaven looking down at them all. We need a vision to see that Christ not only was crucified and resurrected, but He also ascended. Now He is in the third heaven as the Head over all things, and we are in the heavens in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POSITION AND STANDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN THE THIRD HEAVEN</h2>
<p>We may feel that Christ being in the heavens is only for Himself. However, we still have the small phrase <em>to the church.</em> Whatever is in the heavens is to the church. This is not superstitious. It is a heavenly, spiritual fact that Christ our Head has been exalted and is now far above all principalities and powers. Furthermore, all things are under His feet, and He has been given to be Head over all things to the church (1:20-22). We need to declare that all things are under our feet. The more we are bound by our narrow view, the more we are cheated by the enemy. We need a vision to see that we are not on the earth but in the third heaven. This heavenly position is our triumphant victory. When I was young, I desired to be a holy, quiet, and gentle person, but at times I was bothered by my temper. For this reason, I read several books concerning how to overcome sin. Every book provided a way, but none of those ways worked. One day, however, I received the vision that I do not need to overcome my temper. This little &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is already under my feet. The more we try to overcome sin, the more we will be underneath it. We need a vision to see that we are attached to the ascended Head. Our position is in the exaltation of Christ, and because we are attached to the exalted Christ, we are far above all the negative things. We should not consider whether we have seen this vision. We should simply say, &ldquo;Praise You, Lord Jesus. You are the exalted Christ, and Your exaltation is to the church, including me.&rdquo; If we thank the Lord in this way, we will be released. We will see that we are in the third heaven and that everything is under our feet.</p>
<p>The exaltation of Christ operates for the church. The proper church life is not a matter on the earth. It is something in resurrection and ascension. Many Christians do not have this vision, but we need to gain it. This is the full gospel, a gospel that includes not only the death and resurrection of Christ but also His ascension. Not many today preach the ascended Christ. Every preacher speaks of the death of Christ, and many also preach the resurrection of Christ, but it is difficult to find someone who preaches concerning the ascension of Christ. Our Christ is not only the crucified and resurrected Christ; He is also the ascended, exalted Christ. We must all see this. On the day of Pentecost when Peter stood to preach, He preached not from the earth but from the third heaven to the people on the earth. The third heaven is the position of the church. In His death Christ has dealt with all the negative things, and in His resurrection He regenerated us so that we may have the divine life and nature. Now in His exaltation and ascension we have a heavenly position and standing. We are the church both in resurrection and in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST GIVING GIFTS TO THE CHURCH<br />
FOR THE FUNCTION OF HIS MEMBERS</h2>
<p>In His ascension Christ also received gifts from the Father and gave them to the Body for its building up (Psa. 68:18; Eph. 4:7-8, 11-16). These gifts include each of us as His members. Some Christians feel that it is sufficient simply to go to a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning &ldquo;service,&rdquo; because this does not require them to do anything. They do not need to pray, speak, or even sing. They can simply sit and relax while a hired pastor and a choir do everything for them. In the church life, however, the brothers and sisters realize that they need to function, but they may still feel that it is difficult to function. One Lord&rsquo;s Day morning I received the burden to tell the saints that we can all function. I said, &ldquo;At least you can speak four words.&rdquo; Then I considered what four words I should tell them to speak. I said, &ldquo;You can all say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; Since that time, speaking these four words has helped many saints to function. By saying &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; many brothers and sisters have been stirred up.</p>
<p>We should not be silent and dead. Rather, we need to shout, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Every member of our physical body has a function and is a gift to the body. Even our little finger is a precious gift to our body. We should not say that we are too small. Being small does not mean that we have nothing. We all have something, even if it is small. The reason we do not function as members of the living Body of Christ is that we are short of the vision of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Christ&rsquo;s ascension indicates His triumphant victory over all things. We must not be bothered by anything. We must say, &ldquo;I am in the third heaven.&rdquo; When we say this, our function will immediately come out. If we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s exaltation, we will be stirred up to speak for the Lord. We should not consider what to say; we should simply speak, because we will have something to say. Christ&rsquo;s ascension not only lifts us above all the negative things, but it also affords us our function. When we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s exaltation, we realize that we are gifts, and we have something to speak. Our silence is due to our lack of the heavenly vision concerning Christ&rsquo;s exaltation. We should read the New Testament again, especially the Epistles of Paul, in order to see the extent of Christ&rsquo;s ascension and exaltation.</p>
<p>The church is not merely a group of religious or ethical people who are learning how to be moral and have good behavior. This is what the disciples of Confucius do. We are the members of the ascended Christ. Therefore, we do not need mere doctrinal teachings; we need a vision. Teachings alone do not avail to bring forth our function. When I was young, I observed how in nearly every wedding the pastor read Ephesians 5:21-25 to exhort the new couple. He would say to the husband, &ldquo;From today on, you must love your wife at any cost. Do you agree to this?&rdquo; Then he would say to the bride, &ldquo;You must realize that from today on, you are no longer the head. You must promise to submit to your husband for the rest of your life.&rdquo; However, after only a short time the husband could not love his wife, and the wife could not submit to her husband. Regardless of how much the pastor charges a bridegroom and a bride, mere teachings do not avail. After I was called by the Lord into the ministry in the church life, young brothers and sisters would come to me asking for help in their marriage. At first I followed the example I had learned, and I would read Ephesians 5:21-25 with them, but I eventually learned that this did not work. When I contacted the Lord, He adjusted me and led me to read verse 18, which says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; In ourselves we cannot love our wife or submit to our husband, but when we are filled in our spirit with God, with the Spirit as the heavenly wine, it is easy for us to love and to submit. It is a matter not of duty but of being filled. It is the filling of the Holy Spirit in our spirit that avails.</p>
<p>Today we have the filling of the Spirit, and we also have the ascension and exaltation of Christ. May the Lord open the heavens to us that we may see that we are not only on the earth but also in the heavens. We are now in the heavens in the exaltation of Christ, and everything is under our feet. Moreover, we are all qualified and equipped to function by speaking for the Lord. We must not be timid and say that we cannot function. If we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s ascension, we will be equipped and gifted. All negative things will be under our feet, and we will be released to function, pray, shout, and say Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIFIED, RESURRECTED, AND<br />
ASCENDED CHRIST DWELLING IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very Christ in the third heaven, has entered into our being to dwell there. Do not ask how this can be. It is marvelous and mysterious. On the one hand, Christ is in the third heaven, but on the other hand, He is dwelling within us. Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 says, &ldquo;Christ is in you.&rdquo; Today Christ is both the ascended Christ in the heavens and the indwelling Christ within us. This is altogether not a matter of religion, rituals, formal service, or mere doctrinal teachings. Rather, it is a matter of the living Christ, who passed through crucifixion and resurrection, who is now in ascension, and who is living within us. We do not care for Christianity; we care only for Christ. We need to drop every <em>-anity,</em> that is, every form of religion, and come back to the living Christ. We are forced to say this because Christianity today has been befuddled. We may illustrate the situation in Christianity by the smell of garlic. If a room is filled with garlic, the people in it lose their ability to smell it, but if someone comes in from the fresh air, he will immediately smell the odor. Christianity today has lost its &ldquo;sense of smell&rdquo; concerning the real things of Christ. Many in Christianity talk only concerning ways to worship God, ways to meet, whether to be silent or loud, and various doctrinal teachings and regulations.</p>
<p>A certain Christian worker once complained that the saints in the church life come together to sing hymns, pray boldly, and say Amen, Hallelujah! even before the meeting begins. He said that the best way to meet is to come into the hall in a quiet way, take a seat, and pray silently until the meeting time. He also felt that it is not good for the saints to shout, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, praise You!&rdquo; However, if one group of Christians sits quietly, and another comes together to praise the Lord and declare boldly, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, we love You,&rdquo; which would the Lord Jesus enjoy more? We find this situation in the Bible. When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem for the last time, the people shouted and praised loudly. The Pharisees wanted to rebuke the people, but the Lord said, &ldquo;If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out&rdquo; (Luke 19:37-40). Our meetings should not be like a cemetery, in which everything is quiet, proper, and in good order because everyone there is dead. Psalms often tells us to make a joyful noise to the Lord (81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1). We do not insist on praising the Lord in a certain way; rather, we simply need to care for the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>We need to realize that Christ, the living One, dwells within us. I was born into and raised in fundamental Christianity, and I pursued the inner life and was even involved with the Pentecostal things. I received many teachings, but in all those years I never heard a message telling me that the Lord Jesus, my Savior and Redeemer, is the living One who dwells within me. However, one day the Lord&rsquo;s mercy granted me the vision that the One who died on the cross for me and is now in the heavens as the Lord of all lives and moves in me. This is not a matter of religion, regulations, formality, or mere teaching. It is altogether a matter of a living person in us.</p>
<p>We need to read the New Testament again with this view. The New Testament charges us mainly to do one thing: to walk according to the spirit. Romans 8, for example, does not tell us to love our wives, honor our parents, or other similar things. It simply tells us to walk according to the spirit and to set our mind on the spirit (vv. 4, 6). This is because the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20). Second Timothy 4:22a says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Today our God, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, and Christ is not only in the third heaven but also living in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit. He is one with us, and we are one with Him in our spirit. Therefore, as we walk according to the spirit, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, infuses us and saturates every part of our being for our transformation. Second Corinthians 3:17 and 18 say, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is the basic revelation of the New Testament. It is not a mere teaching, instruction, or religion; it is a revelation concerning the living Christ.</p>
<p>We must never forget that the living Christ is the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and exalted One. In His death He solved all the problems and dealt with all the negative matters, and in His resurrection He imparted Himself into us to make us the many grains, His brothers, and the sons of God. Then in His ascension He brought us into the heavens, where everything is now under our feet. Moreover, He is living within us to be our life, patience, endurance, love, holiness, and everything to us in order to transform us into His image from one degree of glory to another. What a Christ we have! It is in such a Christ that we are the church. The church is not something ordinary; it is outside of religion and doctrinal teaching. It is a living composition of the crucified, resurrected, ascended, indwelling, living Christ and all His regenerated and transformed believers. Therefore, we need to forget all the wrong things that we picked up in Christianity. We do not want the things of religion. We want Christ, the living One. Because we are one with Him and He is one with us, we are in Him and also in the third heaven.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">REALIZING THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST<br />
IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22a; Eph. 3:16-19</h1>
<p>The church is produced and built up by the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ. We need to consider all the aspects of Christ&rsquo;s work in the way of experience, not in a mere doctrinal way. We need to see how the death of Christ accomplished many things for the producing of the church, how His resurrection brought forth the constituents of the church, and how His ascension brought all the believers into the heavens and furnished, afforded, and equipped every member of the Body of Christ to be able to function. Then we must also see the indwelling of Christ. The indwelling of Christ permeates the divine revelation of the entire New Testament, especially the Epistles. The reality of the church life is nothing less than the indwelling of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGH REGENERATION OUR SPIRIT<br />
BECOMING OUR NEW PERSON</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man Being of Three Parts&mdash;Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2>
<p>To consider the indwelling of Christ, not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential way, we must see the real significance of regeneration. The man created by God is of three parts. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Our physical body is outward, our spirit is inward, and our soul is between our body and our spirit. We are not mere spirits; we are persons with a material body composed of basic physical elements, which are the same elements as those in the earth. Medical doctors cannot exhaust the study of our body. It is marvelous and wonderful (Psa. 139:14). Moreover, the Bible considers our body to be a house for our being. Strictly speaking, we dwell not in a house but in our body. Because this house is temporary, it is considered a tabernacle, a tent (2 Cor. 5:1-8). This is our body as our outward part.</p>
<p>Our inward parts are even more marvelous. We have two hearts, a physical heart and an invisible, psychological heart. Jeremiah 17:9 says, &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?&rdquo; The deceitful and incurable heart referred to here is not the physical heart but the psychological heart. Our physical heart may be healthy, but our psychological heart is corrupt. In addition to our heart, we have our mind, our mentality, which is part of our heart (Heb. 4:12). In the psychological sense, we cannot see our mind, because it is more than just our physical brain. With the mind we think, consider, understand, and perceive. While you are reading this chapter, you are using not only your eyes but even more your mind. Without a mind we could see, but we could not understand. We also have a will with which to make decisions and determinations. Again, it is impossible for us to locate our will, which is a part of our heart. We also have another faculty, our emotion, which is often indicated by the expressions on our face. When we are happy, we have a broad face, and when we are angry, we show a long face. These expressions are directed not by our mind or our will but by our emotion. Our likes and dislikes, love and hate, and happiness and sorrow all come from our emotion. According to the Bible, the mind, will, and emotion are the components of the soul (Psa. 139:14; Job 7:15; S. S. 1:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Person of the Created Man<br />
Being His Soul, with the Body and<br />
the Spirit as Its Organs</h2>
<p>The real human life of created man is not the physical life; it is the life in the soul, the soul-life, the life in the mind, emotion, and will. In the Bible distinct Greek words are used to denote the physical life in the our body and the human life in our soul. The word denoting our physical life is <em>bios,</em> from which we derive the word <em>biology</em>. Not only man but also all the animals have the <em>bios</em> life. In this sense, our physical life is similar to that of the animals. The difference between us and the animals is that we have a higher life&mdash;the human life. When a person dies, for example, it is his &ldquo;animal&rdquo; life in his body that dies, not the human life in his soul. The human life in the soul is indicated by another Greek word, <em>psuche,</em> which is the root of the word <em>psychology. Psuche</em> refers both to the soul and to our human life, our soul-life. Our human life is in our soul, and our soul-life is our human life. In the Scriptures a human being is referred to as a soul (Acts 2:41; 7:14). A created human being as a soul has two basic organs. The outward organ is the body with its five senses for contacting, touching, realizing, and substantiating the material world, and the inward organ is the spirit for contacting and substantiating God and the spiritual things. We were created by God as a living soul with a body and a spirit as the organs (Gen. 2:7). Seeing this is very basic for our understanding of the indwelling of Christ.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were born again in our spirit (John 3:3, 6b). Originally, we had the physical life in our body and the human life in our soul, but we did not have the divine life in our spirit. Since to be born is to receive a certain life, the fact that we were born of God the Spirit in our spirit is proof that another life came into our spirit. Now in our spirit we have the eternal, divine life, which is the life of God, God Himself as life to us (Rom. 8:10; Eph. 4:18). The word used in the New Testament to refer to the divine life is <em>zoe.</em> Therefore, as genuine Christians we have three lives: <em>bios</em> in our body, <em>psuche</em> in our soul, and <em>zoe</em> in our spirit. We have the &ldquo;animal&rdquo; life, the human life, and the divine life. The human life is higher than the animal life, and the divine life is higher than the human life. Because we have three lives, we can be three kinds of persons. At times we can be divine, holy, bright, shining, heavenly, and spiritual. At other times, however, we can be very human, sometimes good and pleasant in a natural way and sometimes sorrowful and disappointed. Sometimes we can even behave like an animal. This is our situation because we have three lives.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Regenerated Spirit Indwelt by Christ Becoming Our New Person</h2>
<p>Since the divine life has come into our spirit, our spirit is no longer merely an organ. Before we were regenerated, our spirit was an organ for our soul, which was our person, but through regeneration our spirit has become our new person. The person of an unbeliever is his soul, but the person of a believer is his spirit. Since we have had two births, we no longer have only one person. Moreover, the two persons within us often fight against each other. It is very crucial, therefore, that we see that our person today should no longer be our soul but our spirit. The soul, our old man, the person produced by our first birth, has been crucified and buried with Christ in baptism (Rom. 6:4-6). The part of our being that is buried with Christ is not our body or our spirit but our soul with our old person. Now, in resurrection, our soul is simply an organ for our regenerated spirit. We must not let our soul be our person, but neither should we discard our soul. If we discard our soul, we will not be able to think, feel, or make decisions. We still need our soul as an organ. Formerly, our two organs were our body and our spirit, but now our two organs are our body and our soul.</p>
<p>Previously, our person was our soul, but now our person is our regenerated, reborn, spirit. Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ without life, but now our spirit has the divine life in it, which makes it our new person. Therefore, in a very real sense, we are no longer souls but spirits. As spirits, we are very different from angels. Angels are spirits (Heb. 1:13-14), but they do not have the divine life, and they do not have a soul and a body as organs. We, the believers, are spirits with the divine life, and we also have our soul and our body as our organs. Because we are regenerated, we are a new person, a new being. Formerly our person was our soul, but now our person is our spirit. That which is born of the Spirit is not a body, a good heart, a renewed will, or an adjusted emotion. John 3:6b says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Since we have been born of the Spirit, we are a spirit, a wonderful spirit with a soul and a body as organs.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that when we receive a vision from God, it is sweet in our mouth but bitter in our stomach (Rev. 10:9-10; Ezek. 2:8&mdash;3:3). The vision is bitter in our stomach because it causes us to lament when we consider how the traditional teachings in Christianity have taken the things of the Bible and misused them according to the natural human concept. Not many Christians realize that their person has changed. Today we must look to the Lord that we may see that since we have been reborn, our person is no longer our soul but our spirit. If we see this, we do not need to look for a way to overcome sin. Both sin and the world are related to our old person, which has been crucified and buried. Therefore, the world and sin have nothing to do with us. We are a new person, and this person is a spirit. Whenever the world, sin, our temper, or any such thing comes to us, we should say, &ldquo;You have come to the wrong person. My old person was buried with you, and now I am a new person. My old person&rsquo;s name was Adam, but my new person&rsquo;s name is Christ. Little sin, why are you coming to visit Christ? Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need a vision to see what we are now. We do not merely have a created spirit; now we not only have but also are a regenerated spirit. This is not a small matter. To be regenerated means that we have another life and have become another person. The other life is Christ (John 11:25), the embodiment of the Triune God, and our regenerated spirit, indwelt by the embodiment of the Triune God, is our new person. If we were still souls, we could not be members of the Body of Christ. This needs to become a vision to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BECOMING<br />
THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT TO INDWELL US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Producing the Church<br />
through His Incarnation,<br />
Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension</h2>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, Christ is unlimited (3:31, 34; Eph. 1:23; 4:10). Christ is all and in all, the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End (Col. 3:11; Rev. 22:13). There was nothing before Him, and there will be nothing after Him. He is everything. First, He is God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; According to verse 14, this very Word who was God became flesh. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation brought God into humanity and made God one with man. After this incarnated One lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He went to the cross to accomplish His wonderful, all-inclusive death, which took away all the negative things in order to produce the church. Then He was resurrected, and in resurrection He, as the one grain of wheat, was multiplied to become many grains (12:24). We, the believers in Christ, are Christ&rsquo;s multiplication, duplication, and reproduction. Following His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens and positioned us also in the heavens (Eph. 2:6). According to our position, we are not on the earth but in the heavens, because we are attached to the ascended, exalted Christ (2 Cor. 1:21). We must not look at ourselves. We must look at Him. He is in the heavens, and since we are attached to Him, we are in the heavens also. Not only so, but we were also released by Christ&rsquo;s ascension. While we were on the earth, we were entangled, bound, and involved in many earthly things, but now that we are attached to Christ, we are in the heavens, where there are no more entanglements, no more earthly involvements, and no more bondage.</p>
<p>Moreover, Christ&rsquo;s ascension has furnished, equipped, and constituted us as gifts for our function (Eph. 4:7-8, 11-12, 16). We should all proclaim, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I can function!&rdquo; We can all pray, praise, speak for the Lord, and preach the gospel. If we do not do this, it is because we have never seen our position of being attached to the exalted Christ. The factor that equips us is our position. Because we have been positioned and equipped, we can all function. If we see that we are in the third heaven, we will be able to speak boldly to anyone to tell him that he needs Christ as his life. We need to see that we are in the heavens and that we are fully equipped. Then when we come to the church meetings, we will have much to speak. Everyone will function, and everyone will appreciate others&rsquo; functions.</p>
<p>This is altogether different from the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity, in which there are many religious, dead, natural, human teachings and rituals. People know mainly that Christ died for their sins as their Redeemer and Savior, but they suppose that while they are waiting to go to heaven, they need to behave properly in order to glorify God. Many even think that since God cares for them as their Father, they may ask Him for many things, such as a new car or a better house. This is the poor situation in religion, where there is little vision of Christ. Today the Lord is recovering our vision and experience of the riches of the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ. We must all see that such a Christ has accomplished everything by His death, resurrection, and ascension. Now all the negative things are gone, and we have become the many grains, the many brothers, the multiplication, of the resurrected Christ. Moreover, we have also been positioned in the heavens and afforded, furnished, and equipped with everything we need for our function.</p><h2 class="head2">Through His Indwelling,<br />
Christ Applying to Us All<br />
That He Has Accomplished through<br />
His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension</h2>
<p>Now this Christ has come to indwell our being to be our life (Col. 3:4), and by His indwelling He applies to us all that He accomplished through His death, resurrection, and ascension. We may compare the application of Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling to typesetting and printing. In order to print something, we first need to set the type and make a plate. Once this is done, we can apply the type to many sheets of paper through the process of printing. The image on every printed page is the same as that on the plate. Christ has accomplished the &ldquo;typesetting&rdquo; by His death, resurrection, and ascension. Now He has come into us to &ldquo;print,&rdquo; to impress into us, all that He has accomplished. In this way He fully, thoroughly, and wholly makes us copies of Himself. This is accomplished by the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>We do not need religious or ethical teachings that use verses from the Bible in a wrong and natural way. To teach husbands to love their wives seems to be according to Ephesians 5:25, but this verse is used mostly in a natural way. The context of this verse includes verse 18, which says that we need to be filled with the Triune God in our spirit; then we will have an overflow of the inner life, which will include the proper love for our wife. Verse 22 says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands.&rdquo; This verse seems to teach a onefold submission. Confucius taught a threefold submission, in which an unmarried woman submits to her father, a married woman submits to her husband, and a widow submits to her son. Nevertheless, that is still human submission. It is not &ldquo;gold&rdquo;; it is man-made &ldquo;brick&rdquo; formed from clay. The submission of the wives and the love of the husbands that are revealed in the Bible are not merely human. They are not the ethical submission and love taught by Confucius. Rather, they come from the overflow of the infilling of the divine life. This demonstrates that the traditional teachings in Christianity are according to the human, religious, ethical concept. Such teachings utilize the Bible in a wrong way without a proper vision.</p>
<p>If we see the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is dwelling in us, He will be not only the supplying Christ but also the killing Christ to us. If we are unhappy with our wife, the killing Christ who lives in us will cut off our natural life. We do not need anyone to remind us to behave properly. The indwelling Christ bothers us within. This indwelling Christ is not the eternal Word before passing through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Rather, He is the Word who became flesh, tasted human life, passed through death and resurrection, and is now in the third heaven. Therefore, He is constituted with divinity as the nature of God, humanity as the nature of man, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, including the headship over all things, and many other items. All these are included in Him to become His constitution. We may compare this to an all-inclusive dose of medicine. One &ldquo;dose&rdquo; of Christ takes care of our every need. Everything is included in the indwelling Christ as the all-inclusive dose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Indwelling Christ Being the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>The indwelling Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. Some are offended by this teaching and consider it heretical. They say that Christ is the Son, the second person of the Godhead, and therefore we should not say that Christ is the Spirit. However, the Bible says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b), and &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17a). Both the last Adam and the Lord are Christ. After His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Lord became the Spirit who gives life. As the eternal Word, Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29), and He died on the cross to solve all the problems in the universe and to deal with all the negative things. Then He, as the one grain of wheat, resurrected to produce the many grains, and He ascended to the heavens to bring all His members with Him and to afford, furnish, and equip them for their functions in His Body. Now as such a One, He is the Spirit. We do not care for the traditional doctrines concerning the Trinity. We care only for the pure Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Joined to the Lord and<br />
Being Filled in Spirit by Drinking the Lord</h2>
<p>We are a regenerated spirit, and our Redeemer, Savior, and Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Moreover, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We all must see that the two spirits, our regenerated human spirit and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, are joined as one spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated and has become our person; hence, we are now a spirit. Our Redeemer Christ has become a life-giving Spirit, and now we and He, He and we, are joined as one spirit. However, we may still not be filled in our spirit. Because we may still have too little of Christ, Ephesians 5:18 tells us, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; Wine is for the physical body, but the Lord as the heavenly wine is for our spirit. We need to be filled in our spirit with the heavenly wine by drinking the Lord. We do not need religious, moral, or ethical teachings. We need the proper teachings that are full of revelation, revealing to us who Christ is. This revelation is apprehended by us in our regenerated spirit (1:17; 3:5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Strengthened into Our Inner Man<br />
by the Indwelling Spirit<br />
That Christ May Make His Home in Our Heart</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:16 says, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; We all need to be strengthened into our inner man; that is, we need to be filled in our inner man. We may compare our inner man to a tire. If a tire is flat, it needs to be filled up. Moreover, a flat tire is weak, but when it is filled, it becomes strengthened. Our regenerated spirit, our inner man, needs to be filled, and this filling is the strengthening. To be strengthened into our inner man results in Christ making His home in our heart, which is the composition of all the parts of the soul&mdash;the mind, the will, and the emotion&mdash;plus the first part of the spirit, the conscience. When our inner man, our regenerated spirit, is strengthened by being filled with Christ, Christ makes His home in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. This means that Christ spreads from our spirit into our inward parts. Christ settles in our inner being, causing it to be possessed by and saturated with Himself. This is the indwelling, the &ldquo;printing,&rdquo; of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. Eventually, this indwelling, this inward &ldquo;printing,&rdquo; will make us exactly the same as He is. Our mind, will, emotion, and conscience will be the same as Christ&rsquo;s. Our whole being will be possessed, taken over, by Christ and saturated, permeated, and infused with Him. We are now in the process of being transformed by the indwelling of Christ.</p>
<p>We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, show me this vision, and help me to enter into the realization of such a vision. Lord, strengthen me into my inner man that You may make Your home in every part, every corner, and every avenue of my inner being.&rdquo; We should forget our old, religious prayers and pray in this way for a heavenly vision and a genuine realization of the indwelling of Christ. Then daily we will gradually be taken over, possessed, permeated, and infused with Christ. This is an inner transformation through the working of the indwelling Christ as the Spirit to make us an exact copy of Himself. The entire New Testament is filled with the revelation of this indwelling Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRANSFORMING WORK<br />
OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:1-5, 11; 1 Cor. 3:9-12a; 1 Pet. 2:2-5; Rev. 2:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL POINT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The New Testament shows us that Christ as the Word of God, who is God Himself, became flesh to be the Lamb of God (John 1:1, 14, 29). As the Lamb of God, Christ went to the cross and suffered death in order to accomplish redemption for us. Christ&rsquo;s death accomplished many things. It dealt with and took away all the negative matters that are condemned by God and do not fit His purpose. Then in His resurrection Christ was released. Through His resurrection He produced us as His multiplication, as the many grains, the many brothers of Christ, and the sons of God, who are the constituents of Christ&rsquo;s Body (12:24; 20:17; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11-12; Eph. 1:22b-23). The Body of Christ is simply the constitution of Christ in all His members (1 Cor. 12:12). Following His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He positioned us in the heavens and afforded, equipped, and furnished us with whatever we need for our function in the Body (Eph. 2:6; 4:7-8, 11-12). Christ has accomplished all these things through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>Now Christ has come into our being to dwell in us. The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ has become the indwelling Christ, who is now within us to apply Himself to our being for His work of transformation. It is not a small matter to say that Christ is applying Himself to us. He is the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ, in whom is divinity, humanity, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, and the marvelous ascension. All these are included in the One who indwells us and applies to us everything that He is, has, and has obtained, attained, and gained. This is for His work of transformation within us.</p>
<p>In His death He dealt with all the negative things, in His resurrection He multiplied Himself in the many grains, and in His ascension He positioned us and equipped us. He has accomplished everything, but all these things have not been fully wrought into our being. Again, we may compare this to typesetting and printing. After the typesetting is completed, there is still the need to impress, to print, what has been typeset onto paper. The work of the indwelling Christ is to apply all that He has accomplished to our being to make us a copy, a reproduction, and a &ldquo;reprint&rdquo; of Himself so that we may be His Body in actuality and practicality. It is by this indwelling work that He transforms us. Transformation includes building (Rev. 21:18-20); hence, it is by Christ&rsquo;s transforming work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared. When the bride is ready, Christ will come to reign in the millennial kingdom with His bride as His co-kings for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (19:6-7; 20:4). After this, the millennium will usher in the new heaven and the new earth, where there will be the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the church for eternity (21:1-2). We should all be impressed with this brief summary. This is the crucial point of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The crucial point of the New Testament is not that husbands would love their wives or wives would submit to their husbands. These things can be found in ethical teachings, such as the teachings of Confucius. In these teachings, however, we cannot find the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling of Christ with His transforming and building work for the preparation of the bride, the kingdom, and the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s building, the New Jerusalem, in the new heaven and new earth. These are found only in the New Testament. The New Testament does not focus even on going to heaven or to hell. The focus of the New Testament is that Christ produces the church through His death, resurrection, ascension, indwelling, and transforming and building work. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). This is the main point of the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING NOURISHED WITH THE LORD<br />
FOR OUR ORGANIC, METABOLIC TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the crucial transforming work of the indwelling Christ. Some of the great Christian teachers of the past spoke concerning the indwelling of Christ, but very few touched the matter of transformation. It is regrettable that the King James Version renders the Greek word in 2 Corinthians 3:18 as &ldquo;changed&rdquo; rather than as &ldquo;transformed.&rdquo; This is not adequate. Transformation includes change, but it is not merely a change. This verse says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The same Greek word is used in Romans 12:2, which says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Transformation is an inward metabolism that produces an organic change by the addition of another element. We may illustrate this by considering a person&rsquo;s complexion. A mortician may apply a cosmetic to the face of a dead person to improve his appearance, but this produces only an outward change, not an inward organic metabolism. This is not the way of life. Attempting to change people by giving them religious and ethical teachings is like the work of a mortician in his attempt to beautify corpses. Teaching husbands to love their wives and wives to submit to their husbands in an ethical way is like adding color to a dead person&rsquo;s face. It does not produce transformation by an inward metabolic change.</p>
<p>The way of metabolism is to supply a sick or weak person with an organic, nourishing element. The work of a mortician can be accomplished quickly, but the metabolic way requires at least three meals a day for a certain amount of time. The Cantonese, for example, eat seven times a day, taking smaller portions in a greater number of meals. If we feed a sick person healthy food, after a certain amount of time a metabolic change will take place. The sick person will have rosy cheeks, not through an outward work of beautification but by an inward work of transformation. Adding a nourishing element to a dead person will not cause a metabolic change to take place, but when we, as organic, living persons, receive a nourishing element into our body, there is an organic reaction. This causes a change not from the outside but from within. This organic change is a picture of transformation. The word that the apostle Paul used&mdash;<em>transformed</em>&mdash;indicates that the indwelling Christ is the nourishing element that is being added into us day by day. Whenever we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; Christ is added into our being, even if we do not realize it. To call on the Lord in this way is like breathing the air, which causes the element of oxygen to be added to our physical body to make us living. The genuine experience of transformation is not a superstition; it is very real because Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is real, living, and rich.</p>
<p>It is difficult to speak these things in Christianity because of the situation there. Once I was invited to speak to some Brethren assemblies in the United States. I told them that what we need is not teaching but the living Christ. Regardless of how much knowledge we have concerning Christ, it cannot save us. Merely gaining knowledge is like studying a recipe or a menu without eating anything. In my speaking I was telling the believers in those assemblies to put away the recipes and the menus and take some healthy food and drink. However, those who heard this kind of word were offended, and they opposed my teaching. To merely learn something is the way of religion, which is composed of teachings with forms, rituals, and practices. When we speak against the traditional way of religion, we are condemned for teaching &ldquo;heresies.&rdquo; Throughout the past centuries many Christians have come to the so-called Sunday morning service simply to sit in pews silently and in a good order. This is the way of dead religion. We do not need to do this. Rather, we need to exercise our spirit. We should begin the meetings while we are still at home, and while we are on the way to a meeting, we can say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord Jesus! Christ is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Hallelujah, Amen!&rdquo; When we arrive at the meeting, we can continue to sing and praise. We do not need to wait for the scheduled meeting time. As soon as we arrive, we should join the other saints in praising the Lord. The more we sit passively and wait for the scheduled meeting time, the more we will be deadened, but the more we come to the meetings in the way of shouting, praising, and saying Hallelujah, the more we will be nourished with the living &ldquo;oxygen.&rdquo; This is not a matter of religion; it is a matter of eating and drinking to take the living Jesus into us.</p>
<p>In the past the singing, praising, and shouting in our meetings began an hour before the scheduled meeting time. Even without hearing a message, everyone was nourished by eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord. After every meeting we returned home nourished and filled with Christ. We do not need anyone to remind the husbands in a religious way to love their wives. If we have the living Jesus within us, He will overflow His love not only to our wife but also to everyone. We will be full of love. If we are short of love, someone may charge us to love our wife, but the more we exercise to try to love, the more we will not have love. Eventually, we may even become angry with our wife. However, after attending one meeting, we will be filled with love. Then everyone will be lovable to us.</p>
<p>Transformation spontaneously takes place by the element of Christ being added and wrought into our organic being. Many brothers and sisters in the church have received a certain amount of transformation. At first some of the relatives of the saints opposed the church, but eventually they turned this way because they saw the transformation in their family members. Christ as the indwelling One adds and imparts Himself into us when we open to Him by praising Him and calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, praise You! Amen!&rdquo; Opening to the Lord to take Him into us is like opening ourselves to the fresh air for all the riches in the air to come into us. We all, especially the young people, should be beside ourselves to call on the Lord and to sing, praise, and shout Hallelujah. In the earlier days of the church, when we first began to call on the name of the Lord, some were opposed to this way. Gradually, however, the husbands began to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; the wives followed the husbands, and the children followed to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord.&rdquo; This added more of the element of Christ into the members of those families, and eventually they all received a certain amount of organic transformation. Something of life was added into their being, causing an organic change in them. This is the way that Christ works Himself into our being through His indwelling.</p>
<p>I was born into Christianity, and I passed through formal, fundamental, inner-life, and even Pentecostal Christianity. Through all my experiences I can say that the simplest way is to forget all the wrong things we picked up in religion. Those ways do not work. We simply need to turn to the indwelling Christ. We must all realize that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is in us; hence, He is now the indwelling Christ. Everything is in Him as the all-inclusive dose. If we need the killing element, it is in Him, and if we need the nourishing and equipping element, it is also in Him. Every element is in the indwelling Christ. We do not need to understand everything. We may not understand oxygen, but we do not need to know much about oxygen. We simply know that as human beings, we need oxygen, and because of this we breathe it in. Christ is richer, more living, and more real than oxygen. We cannot understand Christ thoroughly, but we do know that He is in us, and we know that He is rich and real to us whenever we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Praise You, Lord. You are so good. Amen!&rdquo; To say &ldquo;Praise You, Lord&rdquo; a few times is better than to be taught in a religious way many times. This is what we mean when we say that Christians do not need mere doctrinal teachings; rather, they need to eat, drink, and breathe Jesus. Eating, drinking, and breathing Jesus, the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling One, is the way to be transformed.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION PRODUCING<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Transformation spontaneously results in the building up of the church. The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we desire to come to the meetings. The church is not an organization or a social gathering. The church is an organism built up by the transforming work of Christ. As natural persons, we are clay (Gen. 2:7; 2 Cor. 4:7). We need to be supplied with Christ in order to be transformed into precious stones. By becoming precious stones, we are spontaneously built together (1 Cor. 3:2, 6, 9-12a). As clay we can never be built up, but the more we become precious stones, the more we are built up by growing together (Eph. 2:21). If a finger is broken, the way for it to be built again into the body is to grow together with the hand. This is why the building in the church is so solid. This building is constituted of the believers in Christ not merely placed together but growing together. When we grow together, nothing can divide us. Moreover, Christ is a living stone, and we who come to Him also are living stones (1 Pet. 2:4-5). That the stones are living means that they are growing. This is the way the building is produced. In this building there are the riches of life, the beauty of life, the expression of Christ, and the manifestation of God. This is the proper church life, and this is the preparation of the bride.</p>
<p>Revelation 2:17 says, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone.&rdquo; In this verse there are the hidden manna as the nourishing element and the white stone as the building material. If we eat Jesus as the hidden manna, we will be transformed into white stones for the building. First Peter 2:2-5 expresses the same concept. Verses 2 and 3 say, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; To taste the Lord is to eat, drink, and enjoy Him. This causes us to become living, growing stones to be built up into a spiritual house (v. 5). This house is not a physical building but a building produced by the growth in life. This is the way that the church is built up and the bride is prepared.</p>
<p>We must all have the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is now dwelling in us with all His attainments, accomplishments, and riches. Now we simply need to open to Him by calling on His name, praising Him, and singing to Him. The more we do this, the more we eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him. In this way His element is added to and wrought into our being, causing an organic change, a metabolic transformation. This transformation spontaneously causes us to grow together with others, which is the genuine building up of the church. This is the work of the indwelling Christ revealed in the New Testament. It is by this indwelling work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared. Mere teachings cannot replace this work. This is why we do not care to have regulations and forms. We care only to open ourselves to Christ and receive Him. He is the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive <em>pneuma,</em> the fresh air. When we breathe Him in, we receive His element into us.</p>
<p>Teaching cannot cause people to grow. A mother and a father should not try to teach a newborn baby to grow to be six feet tall. The way of teaching is the way of today&rsquo;s religion. In the church we do not teach people how to behave. We simply nourish people, helping them to eat Christ day by day. In order to eat Christ, we should not only read the Word; we must also eat it. Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). Christianity has made the Bible a book of knowledge, but the Bible must be a book of nourishment to us. We need to eat the word by calling on the Lord and pray-reading. We may pray-read Genesis 1:1, for example, by saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, in the beginning. Oh, in the beginning! In the beginning God created the heavens. Oh, He created the heavens and the earth!&rdquo; By pray-reading in this way, we open ourselves up, and the living Christ adds more of Himself into us. To pray-read in the morning is to have a good &ldquo;breakfast.&rdquo; Day after day we can eat and drink Jesus, and all day long we can breathe Him into us. This will cause us to be transformed.</p>
<p>We all need to put this into practice. It will change our whole life, concept, and view, because Christ is living, real, and rich. He is the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ&mdash;the &ldquo;processed&rdquo; Christ. Before Christ was incarnated, He was the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; Christ. However, He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now this processed and living Christ, who is seated in the heavens, comes into our being as our nourishment to transform us. His transforming work builds us up together so that we can have the church life and become His bride prepared for His coming back.</p></body></html>
