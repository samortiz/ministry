 <h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL</h2>
<p>Surely we have been saved eternally. But whether or not we will be able to share in the manifestation of the kingdom is the problem. At the conclusion of this chapter we need to consider the history of the apostle Paul. First, let us read 1 Corinthians 9:24-27: &ldquo;Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? Run in this way, that you may lay hold. And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible. I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved.&rdquo; Surely Paul had the assurance that he was saved. Yet he emphatically told us that he was running the race. During the time Paul was living, there were the Greek Olympic Games where people ran the race in order to receive a prize. Paul used this as his example, saying that he too was running a race to receive a prize.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:13-15 says, &ldquo;Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward. Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.&rdquo; At the time Paul wrote Philippians, he had been a believer for many years, but he was still pursuing toward the goal for the prize. The prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race. In 1 Corinthians 9 the apostle was running the course (v. 26). In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (3:14). It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. When Paul knew that his martyrdom was imminent, he had the assurance to tell us that he would be awarded the crown of righteousness. The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). This prize is not of grace nor by faith as salvation is (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), but of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). Such a reward will be awarded to the believers, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is the crown of righteousness. The Awarder of this crown is the Lord as the righteous Judge. Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second appearing. This is to be rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. We must all be clear that to be saved eternally is one thing, and to be exercised to bear responsibility in the kingdom is another thing. Based upon our exercise in the kingdom, we will either be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens or suffer loss in the next age. We must realize that as Christians today we are in the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;today to be exercised and tomorrow to be rewarded.</p>
