   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE VIRTUES OF THE DIVINE BIRTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRACTICE THE DIVINE LOVE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:14-19a SOURCE, ESSENCE, ELEMENT, AND SPHERE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First John 3:14a says, We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we saw that death is of the Devil, the source of death, and that life is of God, the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only are death and life of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To pass out of death into life is to pass out of the source, essence, element, and sphere of death into the source, essence, element, and sphere of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This took place when we were regenerated, born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to consider further the source, essence, element, and sphere both of death and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the difference between the essence of life and the element of life, and what is the difference between the element of life and the sphere of life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is important for us to understand the difference between these things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps the best way to point out the difference between source, essence, element, and sphere as applied to both life and death is to use the following illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a particular drink is composed of three elements: milk, tea, and sugar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each element has its own essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that with tea there is the essence, the substance, of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In like manner, milk and sugar each have different essences or substances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We would not say that this drink is made up of three substances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we would say that the drink is composed of three elements and that within these elements are three different essences or substances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were saved, we received more than one element from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We received life, and we also received righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both life and righteousness are mentioned in Romans 5.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What elements did we have before we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before we were saved we were one with Satan, and we had the elements of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we were saved, we received righteousness, which is versus sin, and life, which is versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On both the negative side and the positive side, we have two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the negative side, we have sin and death; on the positive side, we have righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In each of these four elements there is a certain kind of essence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The essence of life and the essence of righteousness are of one kind, and the essence of sin and the essence of death are a different kind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Righteousness and Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us now apply these matters to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were in the element of death, we experienced the essence, the substance, of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again, we may use tea as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we drink tea, what we drink is not the element of tea; we drink the essence of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we received the Lord Jesus at the time we were saved and regenerated, we received two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we should not say that we received two essences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At regeneration we received the elements of life and righteousness, and now we are living in these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it would not be correct to say that we received two essences and that we are now living in these essences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having received the elements of life and righteousness, we are now enjoying and experiencing the essences of these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have received the element of righteousness, and now we are enjoying the essence of this element.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, we have received the element of life, and now we are experiencing the essence of this element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before we were regenerated, we were in the elements of sin and death, and we were suffering from the working of the essence of sin and the essence of death within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This brief word may help us to know how to apply the essence and element of righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As children of God, we have two divine elements righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in our daily experience we enjoy the divine righteousness and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, strictly speaking, we enjoy the essence, the substance, of the divine righteousness and life.</S>
