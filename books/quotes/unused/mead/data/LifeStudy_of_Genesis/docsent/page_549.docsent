   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Not a Gifted Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Due to the influence of today's Christianity, many think that only prophets can prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But where is the verse saying that Jacob was a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob was not a gifted prophet predicting the things to come, but he still prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 49:1 Jacob said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the opening word of his prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today many Christians are talking about the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But what gift did Jacob have?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would say that the only gift he had was the gift of supplanting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter forty-nine Jacob did not say "Reuben,..thus saith the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, the most profound prophecy in the Bible is the one uttered by Jacob in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the only prophecy that requires the whole Bible for its development.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although it is such a deep prophecy, it was not spoken by a prophet or by a gifted person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 A God-constituted Person</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob was not a gifted prophet; he was a God-constituted person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was not constituted with gifts, with utterance, or even with function; he was constituted with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because he had been infused, saturated, and thoroughly permeated with God, his speaking was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His word was God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether we consider his word a prophecy or a blessing, it is the kind of speaking that is lacking in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the churches need today is the speaking of God-constituted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point we need to consider some verses in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1940 I received great help from Brother Nee regarding these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In one of his talks he said that 1 Corinthians chapter seven reveals the peak of Paul's Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I first heard this, I could not understand it, because it was very different from my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was familiar with chapter seven of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I knew that it talked about marriage and virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, I said to myself, "How can this chapter be the peak of the Apostle Paul's Christian experience?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Nee referred us to verses 10, 12, 25, and 40.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 10 Paul says, "But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife should not be separated from her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Paul was assured that the Lord's commandment was that Christian wives should not leave their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because Paul was convinced that this was the Lord's commandment, he was bold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in verse 12 he said, "But to the rest I say, not the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regarding the matter of a brother having an unbelieving wife, Paul said, "I say, not the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I had been there, I would have said, "Brother Paul, if it is not the Lord, then you should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since you know that it is not the Lord, why do you speak?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We don't want to hear you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are just a saved sinner; you should not say anything by yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I heard Brother Nee speak about this verse, I said to myself, "If it was not the Lord speaking, why did Paul keep on talking?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, the word Paul spoke was recorded in the New Testament and became the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to verse 12, Paul's word became an inspired word in the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, in verse 25 Paul said, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I had been there, I would have stopped him and said, "Brother Paul, since you don't have the commandment of God, please don't speak."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only did Paul not have a commandment from the Lord; he even gave his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We probably would have said, "Paul, we don't want to hear your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We want to hear the word of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although I had read 1 Corinthians 7 many times prior to hearing that word from Brother Nee, I had never seen these verses, and I was shocked when he pointed them out to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Paul simply gave his opinion, for more than nineteen hundred years, his opinion has been regarded as the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, Paul's opinion became God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, in verse 40 Paul said, "But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we see that Paul taught according to his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Paul's opinion, a widow would be happier if she remained in her widowed condition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason Paul was bold to speak this way is given in verse 25: he had "received mercy of the Lord to be faithful."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need the mercy of the Lord to make us faithful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have this mercy, we may be bold.</S>
