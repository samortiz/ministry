   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL BEING THE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 3:8 says, To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said that the Lord gave him grace, and this grace enabled him to struggle and minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This grace was given to him, who was less than the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul never thought that he was great; rather, he said that he was the smallest one, less than the least.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God gave this grace to Paul so that he could announce the unsearchable riches of Christ, the riches he had seen and experienced, as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul s gospel is a high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It includes not only objective riches such as Christ dying for sinners, being crucified, and being our Savior, but also the unsearchable riches of Christ that Paul experienced and that had become his riches within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul preached this as the gospel, and today this is the same gospel that we preach.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>KNOWING GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 9 then says, And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Economy can also be rendered arrangement, plan, household law, or household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mystery, which throughout the ages was hidden in God who created all things, is the mystery of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This mystery is so wonderful and mysterious that it is indescribable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This mystery is the unique thing that the infinite and great God carries out in eternity and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The greater something is, the more it needs an arrangement, management, administration, and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to know God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever knows God s New Testament economy can enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This economy is an arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we know this mystery and also see what this mystery is in God s hand, in His mind, and in His wise arrangement, economy, plan, and administration, it will occupy our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul said that grace was given to him to do two things: first, to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and second, to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a great commission this is!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TO ENLIGHTEN ALL CONCERNING THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may compare Ephesians 3 to a video played by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A video brings to light things that have not yet been seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we watch a video, we not only listen to the sound but we are also enlightened by what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To enlighten all does not simply mean to cause all to understand; it is to show people the video of the mystery which throughout the ages has been hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The showing of the video is an enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may illustrate this enlightening with a video of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who do not go to a meeting may afterward want to know how it was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If no one can explain the meeting clearly, they simply can show a video of it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the video is played, it will enlighten everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that when we go out to speak these things, we will enlighten people with our video.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not simply speak; we should show people a scene.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we go out, we each should be a small video player, opening our mouth to show a scene to people in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will enlighten them with Christ, the riches of Christ, and Christ as the glory and hope within them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul went not only to explain but to enlighten.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s utterance to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God is unique in the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how we lead the meetings, we have to enlighten people with the mystery that has been hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Originally this mystery was hidden in God, but now it is not only revealed to us, but it also enlightens us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The showing of this video not only unveils but also enlightens people with everything in it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we meet, there should be the showing of a video so that we will not only hear something but also see the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Day by day we should have more seeing of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After seeing the video inwardly, we will be impressed with an image.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then when we go out to speak to people, we will become a video player to enlighten people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that through much prayer and seeking we will allow this to become a real vision, seeing, and practice among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A message given on June 4, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan</S>
