   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 2 Peter 1:4, God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises for a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His purpose is that through these promises we may become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the precious and exceedingly great promises, we, the believers in Christ, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Acts 2 and 3 Peter and the other disciples surely were partaking of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is no wonder then that when others looked at the disciples, they saw the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the disciples enjoyed God and partook of God, they were constituted of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just as we are constituted physically of the food we eat, so the disciples were constituted of the God of which they partook.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This should also be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we enjoy God and partake of Him, we shall be constituted of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, we shall never become God in the sense of attaining to the Godhead or becoming an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we may be thoroughly constituted of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all are constituted physically of the food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, someone may eat so much fish and be constituted of fish to such an extent that he even smells of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In like manner, we may become so constituted of God that we express God in all that we are and do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may even give off a divine fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we partake of God day by day, eventually we shall partake of Him unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When others contact us, they will see in us the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My desire is that all the saints in the Lord s recovery would be fully saturated with the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we are saturated with God, the more we shall express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be a partaker of the elements, the ingredients, of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we partake of God, the aspects of what God is become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We partake of His righteousness, holiness, kindness, love, compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is to enjoy the constituents of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s purpose in giving us the precious and exceedingly great promises is that we may become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CYCLE OF ESCAPING AND PARTAKING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:4 there is a condition for becoming partakers of the divine nature: it is having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we escape this corruption, the more we shall enjoy the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, the more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a cycle, a cycle of escaping and partaking and of partaking and escaping.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can testify that because this cycle of partaking and escaping works within me in a strong, rapid way, it is difficult for me to take in any of the corruption of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I partake of the divine nature, and this divine nature strengthens me to stay away from corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the more I stay away from the corruption of the world, the more I enjoy the riches of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the experience of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we have in 1:1-4 is actually a full picture of our enjoyment of God s economy.</S>
