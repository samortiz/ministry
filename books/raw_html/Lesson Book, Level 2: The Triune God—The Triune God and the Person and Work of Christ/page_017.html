Although we see a lot about the Trinity in the Old Testament, it is not enough for our understanding. It is still rather hidden and symbolic. Beginning with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the New Testament reveals the Triune God to us in a further and clearer way. Matthew 28:19 is the first place in the Bible to mention clearly all three of the Trinity together. The Gospels are a major unveiling of the distinctions between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We see that God is economically three for the accomplishment of His purpose.</P><P> Matthew, Mark, and Luke mainly tell us about the coming of Jesus the Son and His redemptive work. The Gospel of John goes much further to show us that this Jesus is the Triune God who comes to be our life essentially. John speaks more about the divine life and shows us more about the relationship between the Father, Son, and Spirit than any other book of the Bible. We have already used many verses from John to describe the Triune God and our experience of Him. There is, however, a section in Luke that we ought to consider in this lesson.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD TOWARD SINNERS<br>(LUKE 15)</H2><P>Luke 15 unveils to us the love of the Triune God toward sinners. In this chapter are three parables that are wonderful pictures of God's salvation worked out by the divine Trinity. The three parables refer to the Three in the divine Trinity. The first parable is about the shepherd who goes out to seek one lost sheep (vv. 4-7); it refers to the Son. The second is about the woman who lights a lamp to search for one lost coin (vv. 8-10); it refers to the Holy Spirit. The third is about the loving father who receives back his prodigal (wasteful) son (vv. 11-32); it refers to the heavenly Father.</P><P>The sequence is not according to the Person of the Trinity, as in Matthew 28:19, but according to our access (entrance) into the Triune God, as in Ephesians 2:18. In the four Gospels the Son, portrayed as the good shepherd, comes first to accomplish redemption, the foundation of God's salvation. Then in the Acts the Spirit comes to find us. This results in our repentance. Then we come back to God the Father who is waiting to receive us.</P><P>The Son as the Shepherd came to the wilderness to seek the one lost sheep (v. 4). In the eyes of God the entire world is a wilderness, a wild and desolate place in which everyone is lost. The Son's way to seek us out is to die for us (John 10:15). The Holy Spirit came to find us, just like the woman looked for the lost coin in the house (v. 8). The house refers to our being. The "sweeping" work of the Spirit is to enlighten our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&#151;our entire inner being&#151;finely and carefully, until we are found. The lamp used by the woman signifies the word of God (Psa. 119:105, 130). The word is used by the Spirit to expose our position and condition. That is what it means to be "found." Then, having been enlightened, we repent; that is, we make a decision to return to the Father. The Father is waiting for us to return (v. 20), and eventually He brings us back into His house (v. 25), which is the church.</P><P>How wonderful is the divine love expressed in these parables! Have you ever considered yourself as a lost sheep in the wilderness? Read Luke 15 again while considering this lesson. You should appreciate how precious we are to the Triune God.</P>
