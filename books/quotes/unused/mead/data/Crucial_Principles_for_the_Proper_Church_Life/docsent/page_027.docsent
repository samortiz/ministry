   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REFERRING TO BOTH CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Timothy 3:16 says, Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most Christian teachers mistakenly think that this verse refers only to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Christ s ascension, His being taken up in glory, preceded His being preached among the nations and believed on in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, since taken up in glory is the last item in this verse, it must refer not only to the ascension of Christ but also to the rapture of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a strong proof that this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but today the church is also the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are still in the flesh, but when we meet together in the spirit, God is manifested among us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The manifestation of God in the flesh is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Godliness is simply God manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must take care of godliness, especially in a time of the church s degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Various differing concepts have recently crept into some churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints in certain localities argue about attending movies and sporting events.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of the disputing ones say, If you say, Do not go to movies or sporting events, you are legal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you say, You must come to the Sunday morning meeting, you are religious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They claim that they are liberated from all legalities and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Spirit inspires them, they go to the meeting; if not, they do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we try to argue with them, we will fall into their snare and be clouded because they are skillful in arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will give a simple illustration that will put those who argue in this way to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose on Sunday morning I do not feel inspired by God to go to the meeting, and I decide to play basketball instead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a brother sees me, he will not see godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not care for what is right or wrong, legal or illegal, religious or unreligious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should care only for godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By playing basketball only once on a Sunday morning, I would lose any power to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I come to speak to the saints Sunday evening after playing basketball Sunday morning, my speaking will be without impact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the saints will wonder, Is this a man of God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will give another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the saints see me entering a movie theater, they will not be edified, regardless of the kind of movie it is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, this is not godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should care not for any opinions or concepts but only for godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some saints have said, To drink alcohol is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not be so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to be liberated from legalities and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not drink strong drinks; we drink only beer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us all go to a bar and drink beer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some even say, We enjoy a happy church life by drinking beer together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This illustrates that we must not exercise our mentality to consider whether things are legal, illegal, liberated, or bound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we exercise our mind, we will become lost in a forest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We simply need to consider whether doing something is godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we discern matters in this way, we will immediately be clear that we should not go to a bar, play basketball on Sunday morning, or go to a movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not matter if we say, I am not going to see evil movies; I am going to see the best educational movies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Using the label of educational does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we enter a theater, people will have a bad impression of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to avoid even the appearance of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if we are going to see a movie about Jesus, simply going to a theater has the appearance of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are here for the manifestation of God in the flesh, that is, for godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would not do anything or go to any place that gives people an impression that is not the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>HEALTHY WORDS AND HEALTHY TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, the Epistles to Timothy mention healthy words and healthy teaching four times 1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the church life we must discern whether the speaking is healthy or killing, damaging, or poisoning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we practice this, we will not be misled by eloquence or by enticing words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how eloquent the speaking is or how enticing the words are, if the teaching and the words are not healthy, we must reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the words and teaching are healthy, they will minister life to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may not have much knowledge, but we all have a taste.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know what is sweet and what is bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must take care of the healthy words and healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not measure or discern any speaking according to eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may easily be deceived by eloquent words Rom 16:18; 1 Cor 2:4; Col 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should care not for eloquence but for healthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must always ask ourselves, Is this word healthy?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should take in only healthy words and healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In summary, the Epistles to Timothy reveal that we need to take care of four major items God s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not care for different teachings, doctrines, disputations, arguments, concepts, or eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we care for these things, we will be misled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, we need to simply take care of the four basic, solid items of God s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching.</S>
