   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPERIOR TO MOSES AND JOSHUA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second section of the book, which is mainly chapters three and four, tells us that Christ is far superior to Moses and Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both Moses and Joshua were sent by God to lead His people, but Christ is superior to both of them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses was sent by God as an apostle, and Christ is also sent by God; He is our Apostle, our Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As such He is superior to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses was God's house, but Christ was the Builder of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the Builder of the house, Christ has more glory than the house itself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses, however, did not bring God's people into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, Joshua brought the people into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, Joshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Joshua was a type of Christ who brought the people into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, both Joshua and the good land are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the rest becomes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Joshua did not bring the people into the good land by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had a partner whose name was Caleb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Hebrews 3:14 we are the Calebs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are His partners and companions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word used here not only means partakers but also partners.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Joshua had only one partner, Caleb, but today Christ has many partners.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the members of His Body are His partners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are partners with Christ in a great corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the Hebrew Christians had been made partners with Christ, there was the danger that they might be distracted and not enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of the people of Israel should have been partners with Joshua, but only one actually went into the good land with Joshua, and that was Caleb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are distracted from the enjoyment of Christ, we will no longer be His partners, and we will miss the reward of the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Enjoying Christ in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 3 and 4 indicate that our progress is in three stages: first we come out of Egypt, then we pass through the wilderness, and finally we enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we arrive in the good land we are in the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, that will be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three stages Egypt, the wilderness, and the good land correspond to the three parts of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our body corresponds to Egypt; our soul corresponds to the wilderness; and our spirit, with Christ in it, corresponds to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before we were saved we were in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once we were saved we began to wander in the wilderness of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we will forget about our soul and take care of our spirit, we will enjoy Christ in our spirit as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There we will enjoy Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we enjoy Him in our spirit, this enjoyment will become the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hebrews 4:12 is very strategic at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 11 says that we need to be diligent to enter into the rest, and verse 12 tells us how we may enter into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way to enter into the rest is to have our spirit discerned and divided from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today's good land is Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we remain in our minds, this means we are wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must get out of our mind, out of our soul, and into our spirit where Christ is our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This rest eventually becomes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be in Egypt or in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must be in the good land, that is, with Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means we should not simply live in our physical body according to the flesh, nor should we live according to our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is the possibility for us to get out of our soul and into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we get into our spirit, Christ is there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We experience the good land, and we have the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have experienced that when we were wandering in our soul we had no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But once we turned to our spirit, we immediately entered into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the rest we enjoyed all the riches of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, the temple will be built and the city will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The kingdom will be established and God's glory will fill the house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The danger is ever present that we would be frustrated and distracted away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some wind of doctrine may take us away from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That danger was present with the Hebrew believers, and it is also present with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may be distracted from turning to our spirit to enjoy Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is in our spirit that we have the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many things today can be a distraction from the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only when we have the full enjoyment of Christ is there the possibility of having the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The full enjoyment of Christ will consummate in the kingdom.</S>
