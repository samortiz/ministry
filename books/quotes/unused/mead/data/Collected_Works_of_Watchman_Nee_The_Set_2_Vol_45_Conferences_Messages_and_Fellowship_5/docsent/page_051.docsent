   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE GOD'S SPEAKING FROM THE BUSH Date: December 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Exo 3</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Moses was in Egypt, he was involved in two cases of quarreling Exo 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through these two incidents, God showed him that trusting in the flesh, in carnality, or in man's power was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two matters became his snares, and Pharaoh sought his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because he wanted to escape from Pharaoh, he went to the land of the Midianites and shepherded the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He passed through many humble, dry, and monotonous days while he was there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He spent forty silent years learning lessons before God and receiving dealings from His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank God that one day God decided that Moses could be used.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses was no longer like the man he was forty years ago, full of the flesh and his own energy, ability, and zeal, but useless in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses had become very meek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no more fleshly or natural energy in him, and he no longer trusted in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God was now able to use him, and He appeared to him on Mount Horeb and called him from a burning bush.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that Moses never dreamed that God would call him; he never dreamed that God would grant a revelation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On that day he took his father-in-law's flock to the wilderness, and as he had always done, he went to God's mount, Mount Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know whether he heard God's speaking during his morning watch or if he even had a morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know whether he received a vision in his room that morning, but I believe that he did not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was a most common morning, a morning that was the same as any other morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But that day turned out to be the greatest day in Moses' spiritual history; it was a turning point in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that day on, his path was different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He received a new commission for a new work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was called by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt into a good and great land, a land flowing with milk and honey, on whose mount the Israelites would serve their God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the experience of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God deals with many Christians in the same way today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many think that they are capable, gifted, and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They think they can be zealous for God, work for God, and help God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But one day they are brought face to face with reality and see that they have done nothing but useless works.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of their endeavors are nothing but failures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then they will think that they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They will change their direction, put everything aside, caring only to live a self-contented and unambitious life, drearily tending the flock in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these are part of God's dealing, the purpose of which is to destroy the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While Moses was in Pharaoh's palace, he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and works Acts 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God did not speak to him or call him at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God waited until Moses had gone into the wilderness and endured a long period of shepherding before He appeared to him and spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only after such a long period of time did the Lord deem that the time was ripe to speak to man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today many people are living in their "palaces," and it is useless for the Lord to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord says one word, they rejoin with ten words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord speaks to them about the east, they speak to the Lord about the west.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems as if they are more capable and able than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have no way to speak to many brothers and sisters because they cannot and will not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such ones need to be dealt with by time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although they have wasted many days, it is still not too late for them to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to man, Moses' forty years silently passed without anything happening.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But to God, these forty years were an indispensable "waste."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Exodus 3:2 says, "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse says "behold."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a man thinks that he is qualified to work for the Lord, that is often not the right time for him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God often calls man when he least expects it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God called David out of the sheepcote while he was following the sheep 2 Sam 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He called Gideon while he was threshing wheat Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>6:11-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He called Samuel while he was sleeping 1 Sam 3:3-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The case of Saul of Tarsus was even more dramatic; he was called by the Lord while he was opposing and persecuting Him Acts 9:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why Paul said, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Willing refers to the resolve of the heart, whereas running refers to man's outward acts, which are performed by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither has any place in God's calling and selection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God speaks to man from the bush.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Speaking from the bush means that God often speaks to us through very common things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He does not necessarily speak to us through the preaching of a pastor in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am not saying that God never speaks to us through others' preaching, but I am saying that He may not always do this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before God spoke from the bush, there was first a burning and shining fire in the bush.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Moses saw this, he turned aside to see it, and then God spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord bring us to the point where He can speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today He is still speaking from the bush.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He speaks to us from our daily life and from all the matters that we confront daily.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May we all hear His speaking.</S>
