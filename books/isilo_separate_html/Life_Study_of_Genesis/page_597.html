Pushing like an Ox</H2><P>Deuteronomy 33:17 says, "His majesty is like the firstborn of his ox, and his horns are like the horns of a wild ox: with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth: and these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh" (Heb.). Joseph is likened to a pushing ox. In the previous message I pointed out that when Christ comes back, He will push the Russians away from the good land. I definitely believe this. But we also may experience Joseph as a pushing ox today. As I have considered my past experiences and the experiences of Brother Nee, I realize that I have certainly seen the pushing victory. The opposers joined forces to squeeze us, but there was the pushing victory, the pushing strength, and the pushing horns. Wait for a while, and you will see Joseph's pushing strength. Joseph is fruitful, and he is victorious in tearing and in pushing. We in the Lord's recovery today are all Josephs strong in tearing the opposition and in pushing the opposition away.</P><P>Many of you have read the booklet entitled, What a Heresy&#151;Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! Although this booklet has been out for several months, no one has written a booklet in reply to it. The mouths of the opposers have been shut, and their writing hands have been amputated, for they have no way to take care of Isaiah 9:6 and 1 Corinthians 15:45. No matter how some may twist Isaiah 9:6, they cannot eliminate the title Father found here. This verse says that a Son is given to us and that His name is called the everlasting Father, or the Father of eternity. This Father certainly is the Father of the Godhead. If you say that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not the Father of the Godhead, then you hold the heresy of believing in two divine Fathers. But in the whole universe there is only one source, the Father in the Godhead. There cannot be another Father as another source. Do not tell me about history or about the Nicene Creed or any other creed. I do not care for the creeds&#151;I only care for the pure word in Isaiah 9:6.</P><P>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." Some, opposing us, have twisted this verse and said, "It says `a spirit,' not `the Spirit.'" But do not forget the modifier "life-giving." This verse speaks of the life-giving Spirit. Do you believe that this Spirit is different from the Holy Spirit of the Godhead? If so, then you believe in two life-giving Spirits. That is heresy! In fighting this battle, I am a wolf tearing the enemy to pieces.</P><P>Some of the opposers appeal to the Nicene Creed. The Nicene Creed is like a pair of shoes two inches long, but our feet are twelve inches long. Do you intend to cut your feet to fit into your little shoes, or will you get a pair of shoes to fit your feet? The book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits, but are the seven Spirits covered by the Nicene Creed? No! The New Testament also speaks of the life-giving Spirit, but does the Nicene Creed contain any reference to the life-giving Spirit? No! Thus, that pair of shoes is too short. The vision we have is much greater than what is contained in that creed. We must not reduce the vision to match the shoes; rather, we must throw away those old shoes and take the pure word of the Bible. Let all of Christianity oppose us. Eventually, we shall see what the outcome will be. In the Lord's recovery we have both the tearing strength and the pushing strength. Sooner or later, the enemy will not only be defeated and subdued; he will unconditionally surrender. God is leading us in triumph (2 Cor. 2:14). The truth is the truth, Joseph is Joseph, and Benjamin is Benjamin.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_596.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_598.html">Next</a> </body></html>
