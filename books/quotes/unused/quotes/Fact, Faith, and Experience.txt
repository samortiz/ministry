Between 1925 and 1934, in the early years of his ministry, he released numerous messages related to these points
For you to cash the check for money is to acknowledge the fact that the bank possesses whatever amount is written on the check
To have the money in the bank is the 'fact,' to cash the check is 'faith,' and to spend the money is 'experience'
All those who sincerely accept the Lord Jesus as Lord and Savior, at the moment they believe, God accepts them as He accepted the Lord Jesus
The writer of the book of Hebrews uses a particularly simple illustration to point out God's accomplished fact for us
Once the person dies, the recipients of the will can receive the inheritance left by the one who made the will
We have the fact of owning the inheritance, not because of ourselves, but because of the One who has left the will
The Lord Jesus has died and has given to us all His righteousnesses, divine virtues, perfections, victories, beauties, and so forth
The meaning of this 'fact' is none other than the grace that God has given to us and accomplished for us through the Lord Jesus
It is possible for us to have the fact of inheriting the inheritance without having the experience of enjoying the inheritance
They are satisfied already and do not seek to put into practice experientially the grace that they have received from the Lord Jesus
On the other hand, he should examine under God's light whether or not his walk matches the grace of his calling
We should rise up to 'utilize' the inheritance that we have received so that we can enjoy, or experience, the blessing of the inheritance
We should not be like the older son who vainly possessed the promises without entering into the enjoyment of them
If he would have asked to exercise his right as a son, he would have had not just one goat but thousands upon thousands of them!
For the one who is to inherit a will, there are two things he has to do before he can enjoy and experience the inheritance
Righteousness and sanctification and redemption that all of the Lords accomplishments and victories are our accomplishments and victories
If we do not have this faith, not only can we never expect any spiritual experiences, but we are sinning against God and doubting His work!
In the Old Testament we see another instance which can adequately show us the relationship between fact, faith, and experience
As far as the fact was concerned, the land was theirs already, yet in experience they still did not own an inch of it
Due to their unbelief, despite the fact that God had given them the land, they were not able to possess it in experience
Not only those who are teachers but all believers should know the interrelationship of these three: fact, faith, and experience
We Christians have believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus and have experienced the effect of His redemption
Although the Scripture says, 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,' the Bible does not stop here
When man believes that the salvation God has prepared for him is a fact, and when he applies this salvation, he is saved
It is just as important for believers to know the matter of dying with the Lord as it is for sinners to know the matter of redemption
After seeing these few verses, we can realize that in God's view the believers have been crucified with Christ on the cross already
We should not try to crucify ourselves; rather, we should apply His death by faith and reckon His death as our death
Baptism into His death' is the demonstration and acknowledgment of our application through faith of this death
The more we consider in this way, the more we will realize that we are alive and that we are capable of and even prone to sinning
If a believer is to have the experience-the life experience-of dying with the Lord, he cannot do so by his own methods
All of the teachings in the Bible concerning God's way of dealing with man follow the order of three things: fact, faith, and experience
Facts are works of God; faith is our trust in God's works; while experience is the spiritual encounters in our life
Not only does sanctification follow this principle; many other major doctrines concerning God's way with man also follow this principle
In experience, it was 'altogether a defeat' for them, for they wronged and defrauded and sinned against Christ
The high position that we have obtained in fact does not come through our self-effort, diligence, self-buffeting, or pretense
When temptation comes, we will live out these accomplishments as if we have already attained to the position that the Lord has placed us in
The experience of the believers' spiritual life is fully based on the facts that God has accomplished for them
Before there can be any lofty spiritual life in the believers, there first must be the perfect work of the Lord Jesus as its wellspring
The Holy Spirit does not accomplish any fact for us; He only makes the things that have been accomplished real and living in our lives
We have many sins, which make our heart sad whenever we think about them and cause us to think that we are not saved
If we are not, we should make haste to believe in Jesus Christ and come to God through trusting in His saving accomplishment for us
If you trust in the accomplishment of the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, you will be saved
If you do not accept the Lord Jesus as the Savior, there will be no hope for your salvation because you cannot save yourself
If you accept the Lord Jesus as the sin offering, you do not have to hope to be saved because you have eternal life already
John 3:16 clearly says that as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus, you do not perish, but have eternal life
If they have believed in the Lord as their Savior but consider that they are not yet saved, they change John 3:16!
Whenever we believe in the Lord Jesus and have our sins washed by the blood; at that moment, we do not perish, but have eternal life
The judgment of the goats and the sheep refers to the judgment of the Gentile nations at the coming of the Lord Jesus with His saints
To say that we are saved indicates that we were sinners and were to perish, but that we are now saved by Him through trusting in Him
The more we see the depth of our sins and the immensity of the Lord's forgiveness, the more we will love the Lord
When the man hears the hopeful words, he rejoices, and when he hears the discouraging words, he is in distress
What a pity that many children of God listen to others' talk and to their own feeling; they are drifting back and forth
To believe in the Lord Jesus means nothing other than a willingness on the part of us the helpless and destitute sinners to be saved by Him
If a man knows that he is saved, he will not want to sin anymore, and he will also bear heavenly characteristics in his thought and conduct
He does not need to know more about China, but he needs to learn the customs and fashions of the other country
In other words, all those who are about to go to America have a natural tendency to act and move like an American
Just like those who are going to America try to be Americans, those who are going heavenward will surely learn to be heavenly persons
What gratitude and affection we have to realize that the Lord has saved us from perdition and has given us eternal life
As a result, all the authority, riches, wisdom, power, honor, glory, and praise be unto the slain Lamb for now and evermore!
Since He has loved us and saved us, we should love Him out of a sense of gratitude and should live as saved persons on earth
Since He has begun the good work in our heart, He will surely complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus
For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living'
These few verses show us the relationship between the death of Christ on the cross and the old and new covenants
These three verses speak of two kinds of relationships the Lord's death has with the old and the new covenants
Although they offered to God animals as atonement for their sins, their sins were only covered; their sins were not removed
Through His death He redeemed man from the sins he committed in the first covenant and became the Mediator of the new covenant
His being the Mediator of the new covenant is based on His redemption of the sins of those in the first covenant
A testament means an arrangement made by a testator for the passing of his possessions to his heir at the testator's death
Since He was willing to bear the sins of those in the first covenant, He is also willing to pass on all that is promised in this covenant
Without His death, the Old Testament could not be complete, for the requirement of its law would not have been met
If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?
Although the animals were innocent, and although they were without blemish, they could not redeem man from his sins
Those who offered the sacrifices in the Old Testament, consciously or unconsciously, believed in a coming crucified Savior
As men in the Old Testament looked to a coming Savior and were saved, in the same way we look to a past Savior and are saved
In reading Hebrews 9:12-15 it would be very meaningful if we link together the three 'eternals' in these verses
The word 'one' means that the Lord's sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once
To Him, the cross is not merely an event of a certain time, on a certain date of a certain month of a certain year
Before the Lord Jesus left heaven, and while He was still in glory, He knew the suffering of the cross already
Humanly speaking, those in the Old Testament believed in a coming cross, while those in the New Testament believe in a past cross
If the Lord Jesus had not died and His body not been broken, men could not pass through Him and could not enter the Holy of Holies
In the ancient times, unless the high priest had fresh blood of newly offered sacrifices, he would die before the Lord
Since we have such a fresh, redeeming Savior, we should receive Him and come to God through Him to receive forgiveness and blessing
The angels can never forget this, and those ascended and saved ones can never forget the redemption of the cross
He knew that worldly affairs, distractions, and temptations would come and would secretly rob the freshness of the cross from us
When they beheld Jesus on the cross and the way He suffered and was rebuked by men, the love of the cross inspired them and moved them
It is because we lack the eternal fresh revelation of the cross before us that we despise the love of the Lord
If the cross on which the Lord died for us is forever fresh, our crucifixion with Him will also become unchanging
If we see the eternal freshness of the cross and its ever unchanging nature, our death to sin will also be unchanging
If we stumble by accident and we come to Him and confess our sins He will forgive us and the blood of His Son will cleanse us from all sin
In the night, the Israelites may have been in the camp still murmuring, but the burnt offering on the altar continually interceded for them!
Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing'
Many believers desire to have the revelation of God; they aspire to noble transformation and 'third heaven' experiences
As a result, they cry out to God with their whole being, seeking for God as the deer seeks for a stream of water
She was very bright and intended to study for a certain degree, but eventually, she changed her mind and became a worker of Christ
The more we ask ourselves and search, seek, and look within ourselves, the more we feel we have no faith or very little faith!
Since the source of faith is not within us, we cannot obtain faith if we turn within ourselves to search for it
In other words, men have faith or increase in faith because God possesses a nature that makes it easy for men to trust in Him
Believing in God means committing ourselves and our things to God and trusting in Him to accomplish these things for us
Since he was honest, trustworthy, and reliable, you spontaneously committed your entire business into his hand
Most of the time, we do not dare commit ourselves and our things to God under the pretext that our faith is too small
The reason we do not dare commit ourselves to God is neither the absence of our faith nor the smallness of our faith
When a baby is in danger, his fear ceases and he is at peace when he just touches his father's hand or mother's face
It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy
When we understand His word, we will realize what God has promised for us and what He does and does not want to do
Mindlessly believing, without a basis, is superstition, and no one will receive anything from this kind of faith
In the stories in the Bible, we see how God worked for His children and stretched forth His mighty arm to save, protect, and guide
After considering all the work that God has done in the past, we realize that all of His promises in the present are faithful
The powers of the heavens are behind us and backing us up so that in all things we can overcome through the divine power
If God's children cannot commit their bodies to God when they are sick, who will believe that they have faith?
If believers cannot trust in God's arrangement concerning their occupations, can their professed faith help them?
The best test is to ask: if we really have faith, would we be willing to trust solely in God without medicine?
If God is the God who feeds the sparrow and cares for the lilies, can He not take care of our food and clothing?
The real problem is that the saints are either in their fat years or their lean years and have not looked to God
According to the biblical teaching here, if we believe God in a certain matter, we should have a work of faith in that matter
If we commit a matter to the Lord and believe that God will work for us, our attitude toward the matter will surely see a great change
There must be works to our faith, and the first step of our work of faith is to stop our own works and rest in God's love, wisdom, and power
In addition, we know our own emptiness and that nothing can be accomplished through our designs and laborious schemes
Sometimes He speaks to us through the holy Word, reveals His view concerning a certain matter, and gives a promise
Rather, it refers to the promises in which the revelation in our spirit does not contradict the teaching of the Bible
If the death of our natural life is not substantial and deep enough, an immediate answer would strengthen our soul-life
If we trust in God when we are in trials, we should not tell others, hint at help from others, or resort to other methods
Faith is exercised before something is accomplished and believes, based on God's promises, that it has already been accomplished
If the work of our faith is something conscious, artificial, and pretentious, we have not yet learned the lesson of faith
Although all the works of faith are beyond human reason, they are carried out according to the principle of one's living
Anything not according to the will of the good God or anything not done through the power of the good God is not good; it is sin
The greatest accomplishment of faith is not that God works for the believer, but that the believer stops his own work
He demands the believers to totally stop everything that is of the self, whether it be in intention or in ability
If there is still restlessness in our heart and body, whether it be anxiety or labor, it shows that we have no faith
If we are still worried from looking at our poor self and our difficult environment, it means that we have never yet relied on God
Inasmuch as the faith at our initial salvation was given by God , the faith in our daily life is also given by God
Nothing else is needed to prove how useless a believer can be in himself; we only need to look at the matter of faith in God
Many times, we desire faith in order to achieve something, only to find that there is no way to obtain such faith
Even in the matter of believing in God for the fulfillment of a certain work, God wants us to simply be a vessel
Of course, this is a suffering to the flesh, because there is no possibility for its activity and no room for its craving
In other words, if we wanted something carried out, all we would have to do is believe a little, and we would get God's work done
To say what we have said does not mean that we can now neglect everything and simply wait for the visitation of this faith
Redemption was accomplished more than nineteen hundred years ago, while salvation was accomplished on the day you believed in the Lord
The resurrection of Christ took place more than nineteen hundred years ago, but it is manifested in you on the day you believe
Crucifixion with Christ requires obedience; the power of resurrection requires obedience; and the place of ascension requires obedience
Whether it is death, resurrection, or ascension, there must first be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before there can be the faith
Preachers can only speak doctrines to men, but there must be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before men can have faith
Perhaps one day when we heard someone speak about the death of the Lord Jesus on our behalf, there was one word that touched our heart
Just as he needs to see Christ's death, he also needs to see resurrection, ascension, and all the other truths
A brother said that it was good and that he would be victorious from then on because he now knew the way to victory
Since He has died you also have died since He has resurrected you also have resurrected and since He has ascended you also have ascended
Once he wrote to his sister about how his heart was very troubled because he felt that he was lacking sanctification, life, and power within
For a few months he prayed, struggled, fasted, made resolutions, read the Bible, and used more time for quiet meditation
He wished he could abide in Christ forever, but it seemed that after dwelling in Him for a short while, he came out again
After he had prepared the outline, he knelt down to pray, 'I respectfully present the draft of this message before You
There are many who pray for resurrection and ascension, but God says that in Christ we are resurrected and ascended
There are many who pray to overcome the world, but the Word of God says that the victory which has overcome the world is our faith
They may not have seen many things, but as long as they see one verse and truly believe in it, they can walk in the path before them
We must believe in God's Word more than our circumstances, feelings, trials, sins, lusts, and unclean thoughts
Whenever God touches us on a certain point, and instead we want God to go along with us, we are not obeying God
Perhaps God wants you to obey immediately after you have believed, or He may wait a little while before He asks you to obey
Anyone who has not presented his body to God and thinks that believing alone is sufficient is like an unturned cake
He felt something wrong with his spiritual life, and he prayed to God, 'I have a great deal of unbelief on many occasions
If others can earn a doctorate of philosophy and at the same time be used by God, why could he not do the same?
Hebrews is written to the believers, those who are saved and have eternal life; therefore, the more accurate translation is 'live by faith'
Many believers frequently wonder why at times they feel spiritually dry and tasteless, while at other times they are happy and excited
In their feelings, many Christians live a life that is sometimes on the mountaintop and sometimes in the valley
Sometimes he feels that it is only profitable to draw near to God and pray to Him and that no work is necessary
According to my knowledge, the happy feeling and great joy that one had at the time of salvation seldom lasts more than a few months
One morning, though they study the Bible, pray, and fellowship just as before, they feel that their joy is not as full as the day before
Others want to deal with their sins to the extent that they are willing to cut off their right arm after they are saved
At this time they are happy and consider it worthwhile to be saved because their happiness more than compensates for their loss
Formerly, their reading of the Bible and praying were such an effort and drag that it felt like trying to recite a forgotten passage
They wonder why today is not the same as the day before for they read the Bible, pray, and testify just the same
If they are not having the experience of the third heaven, they are, at least, having a mountaintop experience
We have a big misconception concerning spiritual experiences; we think that the joyful times are the peak times of our spiritual life
Outstanding Christians have denied themselves from the beginning in a specific way and pursued after God in a specific way
Under these conditions, God is teaching us a lesson; He makes us realize that our peak spiritual experiences are just something of ourselves
He also does not want us to presume that we have reached the peak of our spirituality, so He takes the joy away again
God does not want us to be discouraged because of the dryness, so that we will not want to be Christians anymore
Perhaps some people have to go through these experiences five or six times; perhaps others seven or eight times
At this time we feel that we have to exert much effort and that it is a duty to read the Bible, pray, and testify
When we feel dry, we consider such work to be extremely burdensome, and we are not able to do it except with much determination
When we are excited, we may not have any spiritual experience but only the results from the power of our emotion
Should we take out our oars and row, or should we anchor and wait until a good wind comes before we set sail again?
When we are excited in our emotion, we are like a boat sailing with the wind; the boat does not have to exert any effort
If this were the case, both the captain and the sailors of a ship would become useless; they would only be able to sail in favorable winds
He is also stirring us up to exercise the resurrection power given to us, without which we would not move when the joy is gone
When we compare this with our experience, we see that, on the contrary, it was when we felt weak that we advanced
Please remember that for ordinary believers, there is no such thing as so-called up and down spiritual experiences
Unfortunately, the eyes of many believers are set only on the matter of joy; they think that this is the peak of spiritual experiences
The reason God is leading us this way is to show us that there will eventually be no difference between the two
Some believers have to go through God's training ten or twenty times until they do not exercise the strength of their emotion
If he is saved, his experience will surely be one in which the times of dryness become longer, while the times of joy become shorter
If you have never been trained, you will see in that day that your emotional strength is useless because the just live by faith
Finally, if you live by faith, you will be able to live a joyful life in the driest hour and live the driest life in a joyful way
In a few years, we will see that joy and dryness are the same, and neither joy nor dryness can affect us anymore
As far as duration is concerned, the period of joy becomes shorter, while the period of dryness becomes longer
In feeling, the intensity of joy becomes less and less, and in reality, the intensity of dryness becomes more and more
If we do not rise up, then we have not risen yet; this is not like what is ordinarily referred to as highs and lows, or fluctuations in life
It seems as if what they received the first time is now all gone and lost, and they consider this a great pity
He goes home and tells others that from now on, he will no longer lose his temper, for he has received an overcoming truth
At such times the environment seems to have made a hole in his boat of truth; all the truth seems to have drained away
Such trials become more and more severe, and he might think that Romans 6:6 does not work in him anymore; then he becomes disappointed
After a while, God will lead you out of the tunnel, and you will again experience the joy of the first mountain
When you hear a truth for the first time, you think that it is yours and that you have laid hold of much of the truth
After you make up your mind to do this, God will test you by putting you in many different environments like your family or school
He will permit your family members to disturb you, your colleagues to trouble you, and many other events to surround you
At that time you will see that the truth you once held onto has become like a reed; it seems that it has flown away
After one or two days one or two months or even one or two years you will not remember the truth anymore and your hand will lose its grip
God will remind you of the truth you once heard, the truth which once gave you an exciting mountaintop experience
After He gives you the truth, He will immediately begin working and create a sense of need for this truth in you
You will find that unless you experience the deliverance of this special truth, you will not be able to get through
By the time you come out of the tunnel, you will rediscover that the truth which you forgot in your dark hours has now become ours
God has to bring us down from the peak to the plain and into the tunnel before we can be on the third peak again
When they reach the first peak, they think they have acquired something, and they blow their trumpet to tell others about it
When they are on the first peak, they need not be hasty in telling others anything, for everything will surely go into the tunnel
When we are brought into the tunnel, we realize that the only thing that will bring us through is the Word of God
God is turning the truth that we have received in our feelings into real experience through the test of the tunnel
He noticed that of the numerous vases that went into the furnace, only about one-third would come out of the fire undamaged
In the poem he metaphorically described himself as a vase, upon which were painted flowers and letters and colors
All the pictures and letters had firmly become one with him; they belonged to him and could not be erased or washed away anymore
We have to remember that every time we go through a test, it is to help us to possess the truth that we have just heard
Some brothers have asked Why is the truth that we think we received in the first peak the truth we received in our feelings not trustworthy
Even though circumstantially we do not feel anything, the truth seems more real and is easier for us to believe
Sometimes, their spiritual condition seems to be on the mountaintop; at other times, it seems to be in the deep valley
Why do we sometimes love a certain person that much and have the ability to tolerate so much of others' ridicule?
Formerly, these things would have been considered trivial, and the conscience would not have been bothered at all
Only after he finds out that the Lord has fully forgiven his sins and he has recovered his spiritual joy can he feel happy again
Those believers who remain on this level of life soon find themselves caused to stumble again and their previous joy once more lost!
They set up for themselves many ordinances to bind themselves, in the hope that they will not commit the same error again
At the same time, they ask for the cleansing of the Lord's blood afresh and seek for another filling of the Holy Spirit by the Lord
After this, they seem quite satisfied and think that their last sin is behind them, that from now on they are on their way to holiness
Once more they fall into deep remorse, bemoaning their own failure and feeling sorrowful at heart; their hopes for holiness have been dashed
After a believer realizes that his besetting sin is his quick temper, he will try to control himself in everything
Though he may hold back his temper temporarily, further irritations from others will cause his temper to break loose
A genuinely regenerated person often goes through this kind of experience at the beginning of his Christian life
Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord
After understanding the origin of the flesh and how the flesh is just our sinful nature, we can now consider the character of this flesh
No matter how much a person tries to perform charitable, benevolent acts, send relief aid, love others, or serve, he is still the flesh
Since God saw that it was impossible to mend, improve, or change man's sinful nature, He brought in the present wonderful way of redemption
After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, God does not leave us to walk according to the old sinful nature, that is, the flesh
Through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust'
Rather, it is the work of God's Holy Spirit in our spirit, recovering our spirit's lost position and installing God's life in our spirit
The reason you fluctuate up and down and alternate between victory and defeat is that two natures are exercising their influence over you
For a young believer to have such experiences of inward conflict and condemnation proves that he is regenerated
Without the new nature, it is obvious that a person will not experience the conflict between the new nature and the old
In the same way, while the Son of God lives in our heart as our new life, all the lusts in our flesh strive to remove Him
Without comparison with the new nature, the old nature, humanly speaking, is not too bad, despite some self-excusing inclinations and lusts
When both the new and the old natures are put side by side, the true characteristics of the old nature are exposed
Since man's flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed
Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts
Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood
These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature
We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it
Whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh
When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross
Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh
Until we are delivered from this body of sin, we will never be free from the 'flesh'-the sinful nature-which comes from the body of sin
Even though we have accepted the work of the cross, the fact that the flesh still exists means that we must continually 'walk by the Spirit'
On the negative side, we should believe in the co-crucifixion of the cross for the elimination of a life in the flesh
On the positive side, we should walk according to the Spirit so that the flesh will have no chance to be rekindled
A person can read about this way of overcoming the flesh, the sinful nature, from the Bible; he can hear about it from others
Although we say that we trust in the cross, thirty percent of the time we trust in ourselves and in our own 'reckoning'
Many times God allows us to be defeated so that in the end we would realize that nothing is trustworthy in our experience
Now, you should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen your will, so that it will be able to incline itself to the new nature
After the Holy Spirit has strengthened you, you should exercise this will to walk according to the Holy Spirit
The devil is the authority of darkness; he utilizes darkness, loves darkness, and wants to keep man in darkness
Those who are proud and think that they cannot be deceived should be careful or they will eventually be deceived
The most crucial question for us is: are we willing to reject all of our wonderful, unusual experiences if they are not from God?
Concerning supernatural experiences, unless we have actually tested the source of our experience, we should not lightly believe in it
If we do not want to be deceived, God must give us the knowledge so that we can understand the real condition behind every matter
In the twinkling of an eye, when we are just slightly unwatchful, our loving heart toward God and man spontaneously cools down
Under these circumstances, we are tossed to and fro like waves, floating in the air, and unable to control ourselves
Our words, deeds, and conduct are subconsciously affected by the mental agitation in our head; so we begin to act abnormally
When we observe the actions, words, and attitude of an agitated person, we may condemn him, saying, 'So-and-so is bound by his flesh'
If we would quietly reflect upon the way we conducted ourselves during our agitation, we would secretly laugh at our previous mistakes
Agitation is often the instrument that Satan utilizes to cause saints, first, to commit sin and, second, to stray from God's will
Even the most spiritual saint cannot completely avoid agitation; unless he is on the alert all the time, he is not free from this danger
In regard to our real spiritual condition as Christians, we do not possess what we think but only what we have experienced
Although they do not have much fellowship with the Lord, they appreciate the fellowship that others have with the Lord
In the hidden part of their heart, to a greater or lesser extent, there secretly remains the motivation of self-glory
Although their outward hearts will not admit that they are greedy for vainglory their inward hearts are constantly clinging to vainglory
They also have a wide collection of quotations from famous saints with observations about the world and seemingly everything
Their failure lies in the fact that even though they pray such words, their hearts do not respond , and they have no desire for such things
We often hear God's children say that such and such a teaching in the Bible is essential, and such and such a teaching is nonessential
The fact that something is merely a commandment of God and merely related to God's glory is not enough to motivate the saints to obey
Unless God makes all of His commandments as conditions for salvation, He cannot expect some saints to obey them
Would God be so uneconomical as to put meaningless and nonessential teachings, commandments, and doctrines into the Bible?
According to the principle of men today, nothing about Him would have been essential because He did not need to be saved
The difference between essential and nonessential does not lie in the fact that the Bible has said it, but rather in one's own view
May we pay close attention to God's glory and truly care for His will in the same way that Paul declared 'all the counsel of God'
It is a part of the spirit, and its function is to rebuke everything that is not of God and against righteousness
After believers have tried their bribe, they think that they no longer need to heed the voice of their conscience
Many times, our conscience tells us clearly through intuition what is God's will, where it lies, and what it requires of us
Since the mind of the flesh does not like Gods decisions it is naturally unwilling to obey them and the conscience has to urge a person on
In order to avoid the condemnation of the conscience and, at the same time, continue to disobey God's will, one has to bribe the conscience
The best way to be free from the condemnation of the conscience is to remove what the conscience condemns and obey God's will in all things
By working in this way, they have no time and are able to ignore the corrections of their conscience with peace
For this reason, they mindlessly open the Bible and read one or two verses, counting that as their reading of the Bible
Reluctantly, he makes supplications for others by calling their names one by one, like taking roll in a school
Since the conscience is diligent one realizes that he cannot let down at all and instead has to bribe his conscience with halfhearted works
Under such circumstances, they reluctantly speak a few words about salvation to others in order to bribe their conscience
The serious matter is that believers would even consider answering the interrogation of their conscience with such half-hearted acts
Once they engage in such careless acts, they become self-satisfied and feel that they have not neglected their duties
They may be loath to offer, even though they will be accused by their conscience if they do not offer to the Lord
Many times, an offering of a few dollars to the poor is not done out of a love for the poor, but to silence and bribe the conscience
He either reasons and argues with the conscience or uses other means to substitute for the demand of the conscience
Brothers, do not think that our knowledge of the Bible is too small and that we do not know God's will in many matters
Bribing the conscience is proof that we know what we ought to do and that we know God's will, but we are unwilling to do it
If our goal is only to secure the peace of our conscience and we fully abide by God's will, we are still bribing our conscience
We have to exercise a deeper rejection of our self and have a more severe dealing with and deeper hatred for self-deception
If we would give up our act of bribing the conscience and live in God's will day by day, we would find ourselves living in a new realm
He even said that 'the Lord has need of them' , which can be translated as 'the Lord lacks them' or 'the Lord is in need of them'
It seems that He was saying that His lack would not have been met if the owner of the colt had refused to give it to Him
If His people would be faithful to give, He would ride on their colt and enter Jerusalem to receive men's Hosannas
If the creatures are not elevated through the opportunity to take care of the Creator's need, what else could this be?
The believers should consider what sacrifice there can be for little creatures such as we to offer anything to God
They would not save up treasures for themselves and would not consider their offering of a little money as a favor to the Lord
He is humble enough to say that He has needs so that a door will be open for us to help Him and gain His glory
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place'
Viewing things from the position of an outsider is being objective, and viewing things from within is being subjective
Everything that is done in Christ is objective, while everything that is done in us through the Holy Spirit is subjective
If we preach the gospel to a sinner, telling him that he is a sinner and Christ has died for him, will he realize he has died with Christ?
As long as something or some work is done in Christ it is objective as long as something is accomplished by the Holy Spirit it is subjective
We must first have the objective aspect before we can have the experience of 'I in you,' which is the subjective aspect
No one could ever be saved if there was just the working of the Holy Spirit without the accomplishment of Christ
Neither could people be saved by only having the accomplishment of Christ without the working of the Holy Spirit
The water that He will give us is the water of life, and it will well up from within again and again until we sense its flavor
In other words, whenever the objective truth is balanced by the subjective truth, there will be much fruit-bearing
Of all, Christ's death on the cross for our sins and for us is the kernel of the objective truths in the Bible
When a person touches the Bible he will see Christs death Christs redemption and how Christ was made a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins
If the Lord Jesus has borne your sins, my sins, and the sins of all the people in the world, then why are all the people not saved?
Why is it that some of the ones who have believed in the Lord and who we know are saved do not have the joy of salvation?
They are grieved because they always see the subjective side of how inwardly sinful, filthy, and unclean they still are
We need to know that all that Christ has accomplished is on the objective side and cannot be found on the subjective side
If we try to find the death of Christ on the subjective side, we will never be able to find it because this is not God's way
Faith never comes from believing in ourselves; faith comes from casting our anchor in the Lord Jesus, casting from our side to His side
The correct way is to take the objective aspect as the starting point and then have the subjective aspect as the issue
Similarly, if we only emphasize the Holy Spirit within us without caring for Christ's accomplishment on the cross, the result will be futile
Today, on the subjective side, the Spirit will bring up a matter and tell you that this matter has been crucified on the cross
If you say, 'I am willing not to lose my temper,' then the Spirit will give you the power not to lose your temper
If you are willing to go along with the Spirit in one matter after another, the Spirit will fulfill His work in you
If you only depend on yourself to suppress your anger, you will find that even gritting your teeth will not work
You must first see the accomplishment of Christ's death on the objective side before the Spirit will carry out that death in you
In the first two centuries, believers greeted each other by saying, 'The Lord is coming soon,' or, 'In Christ'
When you believe the objective truth, the Spirit will simultaneously make the objective truth your subjective experience
In other words, the time when a Christian is regenerated is the time when he is resurrected together with Christ
Formerly, the eyes could not see, the ears could not hear, and the hands could not move; now they are all able to function
When Lazarus came out of the tomb, his hands and feet were bound with cloth, and his face was bound with a handkerchief
While we were yet sinners, we heard the gospel that the Lord Jesus died for us and cleansed us from our sins with His blood
We did not look at ourselves to see whether we were qualified, but we looked away to what the Lord accomplished on the cross
If we only pay attention to the objective truth and not to the subjective truth, we are like one-winged birds trying to fly
On the objective side we have resurrection; on the subjective side we still need to know the power of resurrection
On the objective side his temper has been crucified, but on the subjective side he should still put his temper to death by the Spirit
One very bad phenomenon is that some people do not believe the objective facts but only focus their efforts on subjective experiences
Faith is toward what Christ has accomplished, while obedience is specifically toward what the Spirit will accomplish
On the subjective side he still needed to count all things loss in order to know the power of His resurrection
Suppose a sinner hears that the Lord Jesus has died for him and thinks that since the Lord has died for him, he can go on sinning
If we continually set our mind on the things that are on the earth, even our ascended position will do us no good
Only having objective facts without having subjective experience is too theoretical one will not have any taste of heaven from this
All spiritual experiences come first from believing what Christ has accomplished and then by obeying the Spirit's leading
Christ's accomplishments cause us to gain the position; the Spirit's leading causes us to gain the experiences
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
There will also be the bride of the Lamb, 'clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
Whether or not the Lord is pleased with a Christian's living depends on how balanced he is regarding these two aspects
By paying attention only to the subjective side, one not only fails to gain any experience, but he also suffers daily
