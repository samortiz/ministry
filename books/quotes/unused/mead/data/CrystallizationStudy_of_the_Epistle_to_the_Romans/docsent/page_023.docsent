   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Believers, Becoming the All-inclusive Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, all three, the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers, become the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, this all-inclusive Christ is not only the center but also the structure of the dynamic salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. The Importance of Faith 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without Faith It Being Impossible to Please God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith it is impossible to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a very strong word in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To please God is to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without faith it is impossible for you and me to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God could not and would not be happy with anyone without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows us the importance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the New Testament, we are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The name Christian is used in the New Testament only three times Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we are referred to repeatedly as believers in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Galatians 6:10 says that we are the household of the faith, that is, the household of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The name Christian in its original usage was actually a nickname, not a proper name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 11:26 says, The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The disciples were given such a nickname, a term of reproach, in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So in this sense, the name Christian is not a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I come here to speak to you by addressing you as Christians, I would be like a Gentile professor giving you a lecture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if I address you as believers, this makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believers is a sweet title.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Peter 4:16 uses the title Christian, saying, But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Note 16 1 in the Recovery Version says:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christianos, a word formed from Latin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar, or Kaisar , was called Kaisarianos, which means an adherent of Kaisar , a person who belongs to Kaisar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, at Antioch Acts 11:26 they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi Christians , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, this verse says, As a Christian, let him not be ashamed ; that is, if any believer suffers at the hands of the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not prefer to call ourselves Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we are bonafide believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name Christian is not related to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the title the believers is related to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without this faith, we can never please God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only thing that can make our God happy every day is to believe in Him, to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He Who Comes Forward to God</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Must Believe That God Is</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He who comes forward to God must believe that God is Heb 11:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God requires you only to believe that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The verb to be is actually the divine title of our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Exodus 3 Moses asked God what His name was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God answered that His name is I Am That I Am vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our God s name is the verb to be.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is I Am That I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the only One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, when Jesus came, He declared that He was the I Am three times in John 8.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He told the unbelieving Pharisees, Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins v. 24 . He also said, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am v. 28 . At the end of the chapter, the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? v. 57 . Jesus responded, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am v. 58 . According to grammar, this is the wrong tense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord should have said, Before Abraham came into being, I was.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord said that He is the I Am, indicating that He is the very Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why Paul said in Hebrews 11:6, He who comes forward to God must believe that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is always, eternally, in the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In these verses we see the Three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God the Father is called by John in Revelation 1:4 Him who is and who was and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The One who is coming is the One who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that in the whole universe, nothing else is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only One is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is, because He is real.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All other things created by Him are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why Solomon, the wise king, said that all things are vanity Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You think you are, but you are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The sun, the moon, the living creatures, the heavens, and the earth are all vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only One is.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This Is, the verb to be, implies existing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is the One who was existing, who is existing, and who is to be existing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No human language can adequately express what this title I Am means.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul said that he who comes forward to God must believe that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Chinese version says that when you come forward to God, you must believe that there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The English translation is very good because it is equivalent to the Greek we must believe that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This implies everything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do you need God?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God is.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you need food?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why we use the word great in saying that Jesus is the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He told us, I am...the life John 14:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am the resurrection 11:25 .</S>

   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is the real food.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is only one kind of food that is.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This food is Jesus, the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is the breath 20:22 , the living water 4:10, 14 , and the tree of life 15:1; 14:6a; Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is God John 1:1; 20:28-29; Rom 9:5 , the Father Isa 9:6; John 14:9-10 , the Son Mark 1:1; John 20:31 , and the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>

   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Later, I realized that our life is a false one.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is not the life that is.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This means that our life is not something that exists forever.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are today, but eventually we will not be tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>So in the whole universe, we are nothing.</S>

   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Actually, the things that are seen are not the things that exist; they are vanities 2 Cor 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Then what is existing?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Who exists?</S>

   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>You are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Faith joins you with God to make God the only One who is.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I am not, so I should not be the one who loves my wife.</S>
