	 <h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR BECOMING<br />
THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The church can be degraded and become Laodicea because the believers may not have much fellowship with the Lord, even though they love Him. They have received grace from the Lord, and they do not want to be defiled by sin or to love the world, but they are not inwardly burning or near to the Lord. For example, even though we read the Bible in the morning, we may not have intimate fellowship with the Lord. If we do not have intimate fellowship with the Lord, it does not make a difference whether we read the Bible. Hence, our condition is dry, and we are about to die. When we come to the meeting, we are not living, and we do not open our mouth. Many brothers and sisters have been in the church for a long time and have become old. They feel that everything is about the same. When a person becomes old, he is lukewarm.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVIVALS OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH<br />
BEING TEMPORARY</h2>
<p>Due to its condition of death and dryness, Protestantism has always needed revivals. But the effect of the revivals is always temporary. The greatest revival was the Welsh revival in Wales, Great Britain. However, in less than thirty years their condition declined. It now seems as if the gospel was never preached there; some people in Wales do not believe in or even know the name of the Lord Jesus. Hence, revivals are unreliable. When the effects of a revival weaken, there is the need for another revival. When the effect of a second revival weakens, there is the need for yet another one. Protestantism relies on revivals.</p>
<p>A new believer is inwardly burning and wants to testify for the Lord. However, after two or three weeks he may calm down. We can say that he has calmed down, but actually he has become dead. Later when he attends the Sunday service, he acknowledges his inability to understand the Bible or to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Hence, he cannot speak or do anything; he must allow the pastor to speak. Because the pastor has obtained a Ph.D. in theology, he is knowledgeable and eloquent and can give speeches. It seems reasonable for the pastor to speak in the meeting. Therefore, the pastor gives a sermon every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and the believers simply attend the Sunday service. They do not know that every believer has the Lord&rsquo;s life and the Holy Spirit. We should let this life grow within us and let the Holy Spirit lead us to speak.</p>
<p>If a child is unable to call for his mother by the age of five, she will surely begin to worry. There are many in Christianity who cannot speak after they have been saved for five years and some cannot speak even after thirty years. There are such ones among us. They say, &ldquo;It is not my business to speak in the meetings; it is the responsibility of Brother So-and-so and the elders. I come only to listen.&rdquo; This is to kill, to annul, and to not inspire the function of speaking. A mother always tries to inspire her children to speak. In Protestantism, however, the way and habit are to suppress the believers and to not inspire them. This has also been true among us. The less a person speaks, the less he will know how to speak; eventually, he will give up speaking and only come for a Sunday service. It seems as if the majority of Christians are accustomed to bringing only their ears to the chapels or the meeting halls and not their mouths.</p>
<p>Some people say that in the scientific era of the twentieth century everything is focused on professionalism and that different kinds of work should be done by professionals. Many think that only those who have studied theology should give sermons, rather than &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; people. They say, &ldquo;We do business, we teach at schools, or we are lawyers. We already spend five or six days at our work. We are happy to simply go to a chapel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to offer monetary gifts and listen to the pastor&rsquo;s sermon. Why should we speak?&rdquo; This word seems logical, but it is unscriptural.</p>
<p>The Bible says that as believers we need to speak whenever we come to the meetings (1 Cor. 14:26, 31). Some people use all kinds of reasons to attack us, saying, &ldquo;Do not go to them; they will not give you any rest. They shout in their meetings and force people to speak. Go to a place that is quiet and calm. Go to a place where the pastor speaks well and you do not need to worry about anything.&rdquo; Protestantism seemingly works for the Lord, but actually it &ldquo;kills&rdquo; people. Even though they preach the gospel and people are truly brought to salvation, new believers are led to simply listen to sermons on Sunday. After two or three years these believers do not know how to speak for the Lord. The more they listen to sermons, the more they dare not speak and the more they think that they should not speak. This is to bring people into error.</p>
