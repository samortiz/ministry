   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>POSITIVE REASONS 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last evening we saw a number of things that God has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were saved, God gave us His Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not that the Holy Spirit seals a seal upon us, but that the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us; the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This seal will remain until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, not one Christian can lose his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tonight we shall continue to see that the Holy Spirit is not merely the seal given to us by God, but also the pledge given to us by God to assure us of our eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit is the proof of our receiving the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that there are two aspects to the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the seal to prove that we belong to God; on the other hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the pledge, that we may know that whatever God will give us is guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One can see that these two aspects are different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit causes God to know that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, His Holy Spirit causes us to know that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have already seen the Holy Spirit as the seal; now, we want to see the Holy Spirit as the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us read Ephesians 1:14, which says, "Who is the pledge of our inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God promised us that He would give us the incorruptible inheritance in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do we know that God would not change His mind and take it back?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that God will not withhold it from us because He gave the Holy Spirit to us as a proof or pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "pledge" in the original language means a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally, I should pay someone twenty thousand dollars, but I first pay him two hundred as a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A deposit means giving someone a little today and a large sum in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever paid or received a deposit when you bought or sold something?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you rented a house, did you ever pay a deposit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Originally, one should pay thirty dollars a month to the landlord, but he first pays five dollars as a deposit for the house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he gives the five dollars, he is saying to the landlord that the other twenty-five dollars will definitely come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God said that He will give you the incorruptible inheritance in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How do we know that we will definitely obtain that inheritance in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How do we know that we will not lose it?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because the Holy Spirit has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Holy Spirit is the earnest money, the collateral, the pledge, and the token deposit given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God gives us the Holy Spirit, He is telling us that all the inheritance in the heavens will be ours in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a person were to lose his salvation after his believing in the Lord Jesus, what would he do with God's collateral?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, I have a house which rents for fifty dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A brother comes to rent it by first putting down five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is short of forty-five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He says that the forty-five dollars will surely be given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If after a while he does not give me the forty-five dollars, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would confiscate his five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, God cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, the promise God has given us cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if God had not given us the deposit, as long as He has spoken, He will fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if God does not give us a pledge or a deposit, when He says that He will give us an inheritance, He will surely keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because our mind is full of legality, God gave us the Holy Spirit as the proof for us to know that God has given us the deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have the deposit, will He not give us the inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a wonderful portion in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Genesis 24 shows us the old servant of Abraham seeking a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The servant brought with him a lot of riches and precious things from Abraham's house.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After he had settled with Rebecca concerning her marriage to Isaac, he gave all these things to Rebecca as engagement gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, the old servant gave her all these, such as what was on her nose, fingers, head, neck, and hand, to adorn her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, all these things were an indication to Rebecca that they were only a little token, that eventually all of Isaac's possessions would be hers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we are saved, due to our unbelief, we may think that God did not have the intention to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We wonder what would happen if salvation were merely God's toy for us, which, after a few years or a few decades, may be lost and we may become lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is concerned that there may be doubts in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He puts the Holy Spirit within us as the proof to assure us that He will definitely give us the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My friends, when we look at the Holy Spirit within us, we will realize that we definitely will obtain the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God is not going to give us the future inheritance, why did He give us the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If God is not going to give us the future inheritance, the pledge of the Holy Spirit is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our salvation cannot be lost, because the Holy Spirit has been given to us as the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as this Holy Spirit is with us, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible says that He will be with us until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we can say assuredly and with concrete proof that we will obtain the future inheritance.</S>
