   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. CONCERNING ZEBULUN A. Dwelling at the Shore of the Sea and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being a Shore for Ships</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Judah, Jacob spoke of Zebulun.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 49:13 says, Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, / And he will be a shore for ships.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fulfillment of this verse is in Matthew 4:15, which says, Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus began His ministry of preaching the gospel of the kingdom from Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only so, after His resurrection He met with the disciples again in Galilee and said to them, Go therefore and disciple all the nations 28:7, 16, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts 1:11 reveals that the first preachers of the gospel were men of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 8 the Lord told the Galileans, You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to allegorical interpretation, Acts 1:8 is the fulfillment of Jacob s prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, and he will be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. His Flank Being toward Sidon</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob also prophesied that Zebulun s flank, his border, would be toward Sidon Gen 49:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sidon was a heathen city outside the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was located on the sea, and from it the sea traffic went to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The early preachers all sailed from the Holy Land to Asia Minor and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, Rome, and Spain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle Paul took a ship from the Holy Land and sailed first to Sidon and eventually to Rome Acts 27:3; 28:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The history of preaching the gospel to the Gentile world in Acts fulfills the prophecy that Zebulun s flank will be toward Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CONCERNING ISSACHAR A. Being a Strong Donkey Couching</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>between the Sheepfolds</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 49:14 says, Issachar is a strong donkey, / Couching between the sheepfolds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In biblical interpretation this verse is linked to the foal and the colt in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The colt in verse 11 is tied to the rich harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in verse 14 the strong donkey is couching, resting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Issachar is not working.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is couching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is lying down and resting between the sheepfolds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Enjoying Rest in the Rich Land and</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Becoming a Task-worker to Bring Tribute</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 15 says, He saw a resting place that was good / And the land that was pleasant, / And he bowed his shoulder to bear, / And became a task-worker to bring tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Issachar, the strong donkey, is resting and enjoying the pleasant, rich land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also bows his shoulder to bear burdens, and thus he becomes a servant under taskwork.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that he serves in order to have something to offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, this verse speaks of him being a task-worker to bring tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s people do not labor as hard-working donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, they rest as strong donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While they are resting, they enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the enjoyment of these riches, they become willing to bow their shoulder, take up a burden, and serve for tribute rendered to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be completely fulfilled in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob s speaking before his death in Genesis 49 can be said to be the deepest prophecy in the Bible.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was a young lion conquering the enemies and a lion and lioness resting in conquest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The scepter would not depart from Judah, nor the ruler s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh, the peace-bringer, comes, and to Him would be the obedience of the peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Judah would also be rich in wine and milk; his labor would be over, and his rest in rich enjoyment would begin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Zebulun would dwell at the shore of the sea and would be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His flank would be toward Sidon, indicating that the gospel would spread to the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Issachar was a strong donkey, couching between the sheepfolds.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He would enjoy rest in the rich land and become a task-worker to bring tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that God s people will rest while enjoying the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>QUESTIONS According to Jacob s prophecy, what change occurred to Reuben s status by birth as the firstborn?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Why were Simeon and Levi cursed instead of being blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How did Jacob exercise judgment against them in his prophecy?</S>
