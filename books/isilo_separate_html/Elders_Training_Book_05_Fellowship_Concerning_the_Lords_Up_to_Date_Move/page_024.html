OF INTERPRETING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>For quite a long time I have been considering how to use the Life-studies. The Life-studies were written to convey the life supply and to release some basic truths. Also, they were put out to help the young saints to know the Bible. Many verses are covered with many points. Eventually the Life-studies become a mine with many treasures. Therefore, it is hard for people to use the Life-studies. They do not know what to choose. If you would take care of every message with every paragraph and line, it would take you much time. It is likewise hard to use the messages in the meetings. Eventually, I believe that the Lord has given us the best way, that is, to pick up the crucial points of the truth (see Book 6, chapter one).</p>
<p>In this chapter, I have a burden to share with you the principles of studying and understanding the Bible. The Bible has been in man&rsquo;s hands for at least eighteen or nineteen centuries. There have been many expositors and teachers who defined and taught the Bible. By reading many of their writings from many sources we were helped very much to be balanced. The best way to understand the Bible is to pick up the Brethren theology. Today there are at least four different theologies&mdash;secular theology, reformed theology, fundamental theology, and Brethren theology. Among these, the Brethren theology is the best. In this country the two top seminaries are Dallas Theological Seminary and the Moody Bible Institute. These two use the top theology, being based mostly upon Brethren theology. When Dr. Scofield was working in Dallas, he was very close to Dallas Theological Seminary, and his writings nearly dominate the theology of Dallas Seminary. Scofield&rsquo;s reference Bible was mainly based upon Brethren theology. Likewise, D. L. Moody was absolutely in the line of the Brethren teachings.</p>
<p>The first good point of Brethren theology is that it opens up the entire Bible in a general way. In his <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em>, Darby opened up the Bible not only in a general way but with so many basic principles. For example, in the Psalms he points out some principles, from which I received great help in studying the Psalms.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Brethren opened up the types. Typology was a favorite of the Brethren teachers. I also received much help from them in this matter. In our Life-study of Exodus, the speaking concerning the types is mostly based upon the Brethren teaching, of course, with much more development on my part. Thirdly, they opened up the prophecies. It was they who pointed out that to understand the prophecies in the Bible you must take care of two things, the great image in Daniel 2, which governs the Gentile world from Babylon up to the ten kingdoms under the upcoming Antichrist, and the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. These two items are the governing, basic principles in understanding and explaining the prophecies. G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton all followed this principle. Fourthly, they opened up the Bible in dispensations. It was they who began to see God&rsquo;s economy, although they did not use this word. They taught that there are seven dispensations, although they preferred to say that there are four&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, that is, the dispensation before the law and the dispensation after the law (Rom. 5:14), the dispensation of grace (Rom. 5:15), and the dispensation of the coming kingdom. Reformed theology denies the matter of the dispensations, but the Brethren teaching stresses this quite much.</p>
<p>The Brethren also opened up the matter of the divine Trinity. They taught very much concerning the Trinity and Christ&rsquo;s Person. No theology teaches so much concerning the Trinity and Christology as Brethren theology. Lastly, the Brethren opened up much of the truth concerning the church. Nearly all the other theologies do not touch the church. Only the Brethren touch the church to such a great degree. These are the six main items of Brethren theology, and we have been very much influenced by them. We honor and regard Brethren theology as the top theology. If one would read our messages with the proper understanding, he would realize that our teaching is based upon and constituted with the Brethren theology.</p>
<p>However, to only have a proper knowledge of Brethren theology would leave us imbalanced. Therefore, we also need the inner life teachings starting from the mystics through William Law, Andrew Murray, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks, and so many others, including some of the top speakers of the Keswick Convention. You must have an adequate knowledge of these two kinds of teachings, the Brethren teachings and the inner life teachings. If you do not have this, you are not qualified to know the Bible properly. The problem with the Brethren is that they were short of the inner life. On the other hand, Andrew Murray, a top inner life teacher, was short of the Brethren theology. His writings are correct in the experiences, but often quite wrong in the usage of Bible verses. We have learned these things, and this has become a balance and a warning to us.</p>
<p>Today in the northern United States, reformed theology is very prevailing. Reformed theology is renowned for their stance on God&rsquo;s eternal selection and predestination. It is Calvinism that affirms that if you are saved, you are saved forever, because God has selected and predestinated you for eternal salvation. However, Calvinism neglected man&rsquo;s responsibility. Because of this Arminianism sprang up in opposition, stating that even though you have been saved, you may still perish. They are strong on the side of man&rsquo;s responsibility, but they use the verses wrongly. All the verses they quote to show that a man can perish after being saved do not refer to eternal perdition, but to the dispensational punishment of the kingdom. This matter of the kingdom has never been seen, either by the Calvinists or by the Arminians. This was seen, however, by Mr. Govett and Mr. Panton, who helped to develop the proper teachings. G. H. Lang, a Brethren teacher, also took the same line.</p>
<p>Now there is the line of Calvinism, the line of Arminianism, and the line of the kingdom. We take the latter line, for without this there is no reconciliation between God&rsquo;s selection and man&rsquo;s responsibility. It is absolutely right that God has chosen us and even predestinated us for eternal salvation. After we have been saved, however, we need to bear an amount of responsibility by His sufficient grace and by our cooperation with Him through the enjoyment of His grace. If not, we will become a failure. To become a failure does not mean that we will perish. However, we have been strongly warned, mostly by the word of the Lord Jesus and by Paul&rsquo;s teaching as well, that there will be an age, the kingdom age, which will be a reward to the faithful ones and a punishment to the unfaithful ones. This matter of punishment is presented especially in Hebrews. In Hebrews there are five warnings, each related to the dispensational punishment of the kingdom (2:1-4; 3:7&mdash;4:13; 5:11&mdash;6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29). The Arminians wrongly apply these warnings to eternal perdition. The two extreme schools of Calvinism and Arminianism can never be reconciled. However, when we consider the dispensational punishment of the kingdom, everything becomes clear; the pieces of the puzzle come together to give us a clear view of the entire situation.</p>
<p>You must learn Brethren theology, you must learn the inner life teachings, and you must know where Calvinism and Reformed theology stand. Likewise, you must know where the school of Arminianism stands. Between Calvinism and Arminianism there is the kingdom teaching concerning the reward to the faithful ones and the punishment or discipline for the unfaithful ones. After you pick up these five things, you will become qualified and very much equipped to understand the Bible. I assure you that you could never go astray. This vision will govern your interpretation of every verse of the Bible. All the notes I wrote on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were written under the governing of these five things. Although my teachings could be wrong in some small points, they are quite safe.</p>
<p>Over fifty years ago when I was in Shanghai, I saw a paper put out by the Seventh Day Adventists in which they said that the United States would be one of the ten kingdoms under the Antichrist. Their interpretation was wild, without restriction, because they had no vision. However, if you have these five things as the governing principles for your interpretation of the Bible, you will be safe. I would pass this on to you, especially to the young ones. Pick up the principles to learn how to interpret the Bible and study typology and prophecy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
