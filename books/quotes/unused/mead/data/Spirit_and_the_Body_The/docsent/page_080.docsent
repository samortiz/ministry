   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL'S LISTING OF THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 28 says, "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse does not say, "God hath set some in the church, first tongues, secondarily interpretation of tongues, thirdly healings, and after this miracles and lastly prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Paul's arrangement tongues is the last item on the list.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that it is the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible is economical, and Paul's words are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, when necessary, the Bible is repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, after listing various items in verse 28, Paul continued in verses 29 and 30 by giving another list: "Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these verses the last items are tongues and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, in verses 8 through 10 tongues and interpretation are also ranked last.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter there are three lists, and in each list tongues and interpretation are the last items.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, those who advocate tongues speaking today have turned the situation upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have made the tail the head, and the head the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact, today speaking in tongues has been made not only the head, but even the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to some, nothing is more important than speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is certainly an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul is tempering the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, to temper the Body is firstly to uplift the inferior ones and then to lower the superior ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, it is to encourage the weaker ones and to adorn the uncomely ones with more honor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, to temper the Body is to practice mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These five matters are basic; they are not insignificant items.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In all the churches we need to uplift the inferior ones and to somewhat limit the superior ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to strengthen and encourage the weaker ones and to adorn the uncomely ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to make more shoes for the feet, not crowns for the head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Certain saints have had the habit of crowning others, especially those regarded as heroes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From now on, we should not have any heroes, and we should not crown anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In all the churches we must make more shoes to adorn the uncomely members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If, along with all this, we practice the mutual care, we shall have the Body in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the Apostle Paul knew the trouble, the disease, in the church at Corinth, he dealt with the matter of the miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all are curious concerning miracles, and we like to see miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a sister could float in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all would be attracted by this and would have no heart to listen to a heavy message on the Spirit of holiness or the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we appreciate miracles very much, the Apostle Paul took the lead to tear down this fascination with miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would follow him to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 27 Paul said, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in part" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. The Body is not made up of giants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it is a composition of many members: strong ones and weak ones, big ones and small ones, comely ones and uncomely ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every member of the Body is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the Body.</S>
