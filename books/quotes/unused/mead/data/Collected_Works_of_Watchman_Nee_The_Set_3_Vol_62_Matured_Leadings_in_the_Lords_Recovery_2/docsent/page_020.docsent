   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF VISITING NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to take care of visiting new believers in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a very important work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a hired worker takes care of another person's sheep in Kuling and the sheep begets an ewe, the hired hand can claim half of the ewe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the mother lamb begets two ewes, the hired worker can claim one of them, but if the sheep dies, he will have to pay for the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The master will only accept more when he receives back his entrustment; he cannot settle for less.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the future we will have to give an account at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord has entrusted a certain number of people to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should hand back at least that many people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders must charge the responsible ones in a district to make proper arrangements for visiting new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They must never lose or drop anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord has entrusted men to the church, not just to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The brothers in all the districts should have this kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should feel the pressure to not lose anyone, realizing that they will have to give an account to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A LOVE FOR THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a happy thing to see a brother stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is neither something to be angry about.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We feel sorry and sad at the loss of any brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that it is a light thing to lose a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Over ten years ago, a group of brothers and sisters wept continuously for six full days over the excommunication of a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their tears were more bitter than anything they had experienced previously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, they decided to carry through with the excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The excommunicated one was very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wrote a long letter rebuking me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I only answered with a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I told him that while he was rebuking us, we were weeping for him for six full days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was in wrath, but the brothers and sisters were in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were hoping that this brother would turn, and we grieved over his excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our hearts were sad over this loss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a church builds up itself in love Eph 4:16 , it will become a channel through which God will save all men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It will be able to look beyond itself to save other souls.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a church rises up and is up to the standard, many men will be brought in, and God will save many.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason we all have to learn to love the brothers, care for them, help them, and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should do everything we can to gain every brother.</S>
