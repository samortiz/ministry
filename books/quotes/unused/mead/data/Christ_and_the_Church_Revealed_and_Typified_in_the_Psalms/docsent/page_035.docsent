   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Brother Watchman Nee's three-volume book, The Spiritual Man, there is a section concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That section was composed mostly from articles written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis concerning the experiences of Evan Roberts of Wales, the leader of the Welsh revival of 1904.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Evan Roberts himself experienced considerable spiritual warfare, but what he experienced was only on an individual, personal level.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was not able to record his experiences he was a worker in a coal mine ; so he related them to Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who put them into writing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time the church on this earth had failed to see that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the years 1920-1924, Brother Nee read all these books and received help; hence, he extracted all these things and put them together as a chapter in his book, The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first edition of that book in Chinese, he mentioned this fact clearly in his preface.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following the publishing of this book, in the years 1937 through 1940, Brother Nee began to see that spiritual warfare is not to be engaged in as an individual, but with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, by the mercy of God, Brother Nee came to see the Body in a practical way and gave many messages on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He pointed out from Ephesians 6 that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The warrior, the soldier, mentioned in that chapter is not any single individual, but the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole Body is the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After that, he gave a number of messages on spiritual warfare undertaken by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He indicated that in the time of Evan Roberts it was really difficult to gain the victory, but now, since we have seen the battle is a matter of the Body, we need only abide in the Body and the enemy will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in The Spiritual Man the part regarding spiritual warfare is no longer up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spiritual warfare, as presented there, is not according to the light the Lord has shown His church today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was one of the reasons Brother Nee would not have The Spiritual Man re-published.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Psalm 48, when the enemies see the church, they flee in terror.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we are in the church as a stronghold on this earth, no enemy can prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said, "I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritual warfare is simply a matter of getting yourself into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you are in the city, you will see how the enemies will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a mere teaching; we do have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I came into the local church, it was really difficult for me to overcome many things, even the little besetting sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But since I have come into the church, I have simply been in the tower, watching the enemies flee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I'm not fighting; I'm in the tower watching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The enemies flee, they flee!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then verse 6: "Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fear took hold of them, not us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in the high tower watching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then verse 8: "As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have heard something of the ancient times; now we are seeing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"As we have heard, so have we seen."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"In the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, can you say this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come into the church as the city of God, we can really say this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"God will establish it forever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Selah."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 9: "We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is really good!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The enemies flee, and we think of the lovingkindness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their business is to run, and ours is to consider the lovingkindness of God in His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verses 10 and 11: "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we have two wonderful verses, 12 and 13: "Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Set your heart on her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Inside the city we have the palaces, and outside we have the bulwarks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must consider all these.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be able to recite at least these two verses, 12 and 13, of Psalm 48.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may ask the Psalmist, "Why do you emphasize the city so much?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why don't you speak more about Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He would answer, "Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Set your heart on her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is his answer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you have ever seen such a church life, you can understand why the Psalmist was so excited about the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, we have verse 14: "For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Which God is our God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The God of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"This God is our God for ever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is so good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And He will be our guide even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you are outside of the local church you are wandering, you are astray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But when you come into the church, you have a guide.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the church as the city, our guide is our God.</S>
