   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITHOUT BLEMISH AND WITHOUT SPOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 19 says, But with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is important to understand what Peter means by blemish and spot and to know the difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blemish is a term often used for impurities found in precious stones and gems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose you have a precious stone in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this stone is pure, it does not have any mixture; that is, it does not have any foreign body mixed in with it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, sometimes a precious stone or a gem does have a foreign body in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That foreign body, that element of mixture, is a blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A spot is a scar that comes from a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have a wound on your hand, eventually that wound may develop into a scar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a scar is a spot on your body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God created us pure, but the fall has brought many foreign bodies, blemishes, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these foreign bodies are of the Devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, in our natural life we have been wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, suppose a sheep was to be offered as a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That sheep had to be without blemish, without mixture; it also had to be without spot, without any wound.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sheep offered as a sin offering had to be pure and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among all the human beings who have ever lived on earth, there has been only one Man the Lord Jesus Christ who is without mixture or blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, He is the only Man who has not been wounded morally and ethically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask you to consider your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though you may still be young, have you not received many wounds to your ethical and moral being?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must admit that you have not been preserved perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are some who have developed the habit of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being addicted to gambling is a serious wound to a person s character.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also wound ourselves whenever we tell a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe that there is anyone among us who has never told a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every lie is a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a wife lies to her husband or a husband to his wife, such a lie will be a wound to their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of us have also been wounded by stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Very few people have never stolen anything from others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes children steal things from their parents, or wives from their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Stealing always wounds us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our person and character have been wounded in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As fallen human beings, we have many blemishes and wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anyone who has been divorced has experienced a serious wound.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Samaritan woman in John 4 had been wounded in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because she had changed husbands six times, she had been wounded in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was full of spots.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus Christ is the only person without mixture and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not have any blemishes or wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, the words without blemish and without spot are Old Testament terms used with respect to sacrifices offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any Jews reading the First Epistle of Peter would realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Peter was writing to Jewish believers, he used terms that were familiar to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, this verse indicates that Jesus Christ is the real sacrifice to be our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the real Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lamb sacrificed at the time of the Passover had to be without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, this lamb had to be kept for four days in order to be carefully examined.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before the lamb could be sacrificed, it first had to be examined to prove that it was without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what the Lord Jesus experienced in Jerusalem during the days before He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Day by day He was examined by the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the scribes, the elders, and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They did their best to find a fault of some kind in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, according to their law, they could not find fault with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then they handed the Lord Jesus over to the Roman rulers, to Pilate and Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But neither could these Roman rulers, according to Roman law, find any fault in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this reason, Pilate declared, I find no fault whatever in him John 18:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, according to both divine law and secular law, the Lamb of God was examined and found to be without mixture and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only this unique Person is without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, Peter refers to the Old Testament typology; on the other hand, simultaneously he indicates that Christ is the real Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is our sin offering and our trespass offering, the One offered for the atonement of the sins of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the Lamb without blemish and without spot, He shed His precious blood to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to know that we have been redeemed from our vain manner of life by the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would encourage you to spend an hour alone with the Lord to consider the precious blood of Christ shed for you on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will give you the desire to have a holy manner of life in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You will want to become holy in all your manner of life and to pass the remaining time of your sojourn in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would live in this way, we need to realize that we have been redeemed, bought, purchased, with the high price of Christ s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This realization will cause us to have a living in a holy manner of life, for we shall realize that Christ s precious blood has redeemed us from the vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No longer will we want to live in a way that is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A vain manner of life is not necessarily sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, in certain respects it may be quite moral.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless it is still vain having no goal, aim, or purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Anything without a goal or purpose is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we should live a life without any vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everything we do and say should have God s goal in view.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This kind of life is weighty and full of content.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is a life with purpose, goal, and aim.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let us all spend time to consider Peter s writing concerning the precious blood of Christ so that in a practical way we may become holy in all our manner of life and pass the time of our sojourn in fear.</S>
