<p>The last crucial point in chapter four is the two women symbolizing the two covenants (vv. 21-31). Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, symbolizes the old covenant, and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the new covenant. Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, symbolizes the law. Hence, the position of the law is that of a concubine. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the grace of God (John 1:17), which has the right position in God&rsquo;s economy. The law, like Hagar, brought forth children unto slavery like the Judaizers. Grace, like Sarah, brings forth children unto sonship; these are the New Testament believers. They are no longer under law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). They should stand in this grace (Rom. 5:2) and not fall from it (5:4).</p>
<p>The Jerusalem above is free, who is our mother (v. 26). This is a strong proof that the coming New Jerusalem will not be a physical city because it is our mother and it is free. I believe that the notes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages are adequate to help you to take care of this crucial point. This point, in particular, is more than crucial for us to study.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BROUGHT TO NAUGHT FROM CHRIST</h2>
<p>Galatians 5:4-6 is the particular text for this crucial point. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;You have been brought to naught from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&rdquo; This verse says, firstly, that you have been brought to naught, to nothing, from Christ because you are justified by law, and secondly, you have fallen from grace. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;For we by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit and faith are in apposition. The Spirit is the faith and the faith is the Spirit. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love.&rdquo; In the book of Galatians Paul stresses continually the Spirit and faith.</p>
<p>The crucial point in these three verses is that we may be brought to nothing from Christ and that we may also fall from grace. To be brought to naught from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him (Darby&rsquo;s New Translation), making Him void of effect. To go back to the law is to become severed from Christ, to be brought to naught from Christ, which is to fall from grace.</p>
<p>It is quite possible for a believer to be brought to nothing concerning the enjoyment of Christ. These verses are on the enjoyment of Christ. To be brought to naught from Christ does not mean you will perish. It means that your enjoyment of Christ has been confiscated. If you go to other things such as the law or character improvement and do not cleave to Christ that you may enjoy Him all the time, you will be brought to naught from the enjoyment of Christ. That means you have fallen from grace. The Arminians may interpret this as a kind of perdition. They may say that since you have fallen from grace, you have lost grace, meaning that you have lost your salvation. But we know by the context that verse 4 does not mean that. To fall from grace means you lose the enjoyment of grace. Again, this crucial point has been fully and adequately covered in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Galatians Life-study Messages. It will help you to get into this material.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF WALK BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Galatians 5 the last crucial point is the two kinds of walk by the Spirit. In 5:16 Paul says, &ldquo;But I say, walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo; Galatians 5:25 says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; In these two verses Paul uses two different Greek words for walk. You must pay your full attention to the footnotes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages on these verses.</p>
<p>The Greek word for walk in verse 16, <em>peripateo</em>, denotes the daily, ordinary, regular walk. The Greek word for walk in verse 25, <em>stoicheo</em>, denotes an official walk, a walk to carry out a certain commission. As we compare these two kinds of walks, we see that the second is more regulated than the first. In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about. However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps. As Christians, we are not those walking on earth without a purpose. We have been created by God and recreated and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose. Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and reach the goal of our life on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOWING UNTO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Galatians 6 the first crucial point is the sowing unto the Spirit in verse 8. Sowing unto the Spirit is sowing for the Spirit. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; means &ldquo;with a view to&rdquo; or &ldquo;for.&rdquo; To sow unto the flesh is to sow for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. Your life, your work, and your behavior should be considered as a sowing of seed. Whatever you do, whatever you are, and however you behave, you are sowing something. Since you are sowing something, you will eventually reap something. Do not think that to be angry with someone for a while is a small thing. Actually that is sowing. From that sowing, you will have a harvest. You have to sow, which means you have to behave, act, do things, and work, all the time with the Spirit as a view, as a goal to reach. This implies that you have to sow always by the Spirit with a view that you can reap the Spirit. If in all things you sow by the Spirit, along with the Spirit, and unto the Spirit, you will reap the Spirit as your harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIED TO THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:14 and 15, say, &ldquo;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.&rdquo; These verses indicate that you must keep yourself on the cross towards the religious world. &ldquo;For&rdquo; in verse 15 shows that this verse is an explanation of the foregoing verse, and circumcision being a religious matter, indicates that world in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The entire book of Galatians ends with 6:18&mdash;&ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&rdquo; Because of the background of today&rsquo;s situation we have stressed again and again that the grace of our Lord Jesus is in our spirit. If we are going to experience the grace, to enjoy the grace, we must be in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit. We have covered all the points concerning the exercise of our spirit in the past, but when we cover the book of Galatians, we must stress this point and make this point a major, crucial point. All the Christians, including ourselves, have to learn all our days that by exercising our spirit we may really enjoy and realize the grace of Christ. Actually, the grace of Christ is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The book of Galatians, no doubt, has more points than what we have given in this chapter. In this chapter I have set up a pattern to show you how to pick up the crucial points. When we are helping the saints to know the truth, we can never cover all the points. We just take those that are considered the most crucial to uplift the standard of the knowledge of the truth in the churches and with all the Lord&rsquo;s children.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
