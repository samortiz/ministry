   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STANDING AGAINST DEGRADATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today s Christianity is filled with religion, doctrine, organization, forms, rituals, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People are helped to be saved, to become religious, to pursue spirituality, and to desire a closer walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that so many Christians do not see that in the book of Ephesians the church is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his subtlety the enemy, Satan, has used various good things such as fundamental doctrine to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must stand against the degradation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In doing this, we do not fight against people, but against the Devil, the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the Lord is sovereign, He cannot be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even today He is fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord s recovery we are not for religion, knowledge, organization, rituals, forms, or regulations; we are only for the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we enjoy the mingled spirit in a corporate way, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Ephesians reveals various aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we shall consider seven of these aspects: the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place of God, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to 1:22 and 23, the church is Christ s Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was in this one Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We, the believers, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ, but also in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have been reconciled in the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we have seen, the gifted persons are for the building up of the Body, and the Body is growing unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2:15 we see that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This new man is corporate and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the believers are components of this corporate and universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to 4:13, we are to grow up until we arrive at a full-grown man, and in 4:24 we see that, in a practical way, we need to put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ephesians 5 we see the church as the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him to be His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, as Eve went back to Adam and was presented to him, so the church will go back to Christ and be presented to Him as His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 2:19 Paul says, So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As members of the household of God, we are God s family, even God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both the Jewish and Gentile believers are members of God s house, which is a matter of life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All believers were born of God into His house to enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The house of God leads to the kingdom of God, indicated by the term fellow-citizens of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the believers are citizens in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His kingdom is a sphere for Him to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 5:5 Paul says that every fornicator or unclean person or person of unbridled greedy lust, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This refers not only to the millennium, but also to the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God John 3:5 and are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today Rom 14:17 .</S>
