John 15:7 says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
Before we speak concerning the meaning of prayer, let us look at how prayer and reading the Word match one another
He promises that if these two basic conditions are present, we may ask whatever we will and it shall come to pass to us
To a normal Christian these two thingsreading the Word and prayingare the two aspects of his living both are indispensable
The practical living of a Christian before the Lord also has two sides: one side is the reading of the Word, and the other side is prayer
As a Christian living before God, we also need to read the Word and pray simultaneously, thus keeping the balance
When they read the Bible, they may bury their head in it from morning to evening; the more they read it, the better it tastes
Strangely, they pray very little, and sometimes even when they are moved by the Holy Spirit, they still will not pray
If someone reads the Bible more than he prays he will often fall into letters and regulations which bring a dead dry spiritual condition
If we want to maintain a normal Christian life, we must give equal attention to both reading the Word and prayer
Whenever we pray we must touch the Word of God, and whenever we read the Scriptures we must match it with prayer
While both portions of the Word speak of how Christians praise and thank God, the reasons they do so are different
Under normal circumstances, whenever you have the infilling of the words of the Bible, you also have the infilling of the Spirit
Once you realize the presence of the Spirit, you cannot help but pray; otherwise, you are one who quenches the Spirit
These words show us that if a man learns to always fellowship with the Lord and live in the Lord, His Word will abide in him
Proper reading of the Word is surely accompanied by prayer and proper prayers will surely issue forth from the reading of the Word
It is not necessary to make a rigid decision concerning these two matters; you just need to allow them to proceed in a spontaneous way
Please remember, it is also unnecessary for you to decide every morning before the Lord whether to read first and then pray or vice versa
Sometimes you may read the Word first and then pray, while other times you may pray first and then read the Word
In his coming before the Lord every morning he gave equal attention to both reading and praying and kept both in balance
Many people, upon hearing the term prayer, immediately think that it means man coming before God to make supplication
Brothers and sisters, please remember that this is not the proper meaning of prayer as it is revealed in the Bible
If we study every one of these prayers and look at them as a composite, we will be able to see clearly what prayer is all about
By this you can understand the last sentence of Ephesians 1, which says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ
-whether it be his emotion, will, or disposition-express God to a certain degree and are miniatures of all that is in God
Because we have a stomach, we can receive food into us, enjoy it, digest it, and assimilate it into our being, making it our constituent
In the same manner, since we have a spirit within us, we can receive God into us and assimilate Him, making Him our very constituent
Once there is such a contact between God and man God enters into man to be his content and man becomes Gods vessel to express Him outwardly
If in prayer man does not touch or contact God, and God does not touch or contact man, that prayer is below the proper standard
While you are thus breathing in God, spontaneously you are obtaining God, just as when you breathe in air you receive air
The more you pray, the more you will be filled with God, and the more you will surrender yourself to God and be gained by Him
You immediately thank and praise the Lord, saying, 'Hallelujah, the Lord is really the true and living God; He has answered my prayer'
Who would imagine that through such a prayer she would be able to actually meet Him, touch Him, and enjoy Him?
We know what people ordinarily call supplication, but we know little about the prayer which is spoken of in the Scriptures
Thank God in this matter of our weakness the Spirit Himself joins in to help us and intercede for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
They are not simply man alone praying to God, but they are the Spirit mingling with man, putting on man, and joining with man in prayer
Andrew Murray once said that a real prayer is Christ Who indwells us praying to Christ Who is sitting on the throne
By these illustrations we can see that real prayers will certainly cause our being to be wholly mingled with God
In other words, it means your prayer should be the expression of two parties, you and the Holy Spirit, praying as one
Consequently we wholly cooperate and work with God and God expresses Himself and His desire through us ultimately accomplishing His purpose
Any good prayer, any prayer of worth, any prayer that is up to the standard, must be in accordance with these principles
If he did not use a microphone his speaking would be purely words without the passing through of the electricity
Sometimes it seems that we go before God to pray, but actually it is just we ourselves who are praying-without God passing through
There are also times we deeply feel that every sentence in our prayer has God in it-God has actually passed through our being
Ordinarily when this condition exists we say that our prayer has touched God, or that it has touched the presence of God
Because of these two aspects of passing through, when we pray we often sense God's presence more strongly than at any other time
In our daily living, God's presence is with us in the closest, deepest, strongest, and sweetest way when we have had really good prayer
While we pray, on the one hand, it is God passing through our being, and on the other hand, it is also we, our being, passing through God
On one hand, it is God passing through the words of our prayer, while on the other hand, it is the words of our prayer passing through God
Prayer is not only a matter of God and man's mutual passing through, but also a matter which God and man do together
Speaking, it is God coming forth from him, for it is not only he praying there, but God and he praying together
A prayer that is up to the standard must be one in which man is not praying for himself or for others, but for God
Even when we pray for sinners to be saved or for the brothers and sisters to be revived, we ought to be praying for God
If You would rather let Your authority and benefit suffer loss, my poverty and hunger are insignificant matters'
In your prayer could you say to God, 'O God, my child is sick, please heal him; yet my prayer is not for my own sake, but for Your sake'?
Not only when this one child is ill, but even if all my children were sick and all would die, it is Your business, not mine'
When you prayed for this matter, it was as if you were expressing your desire, but actually it was His very desire being expressed
Because of this before we open our mouth to pray for some matters we need to have a considerable length of time to open our being before God
Rather, he is one who daily carries with him a spirit of prayer, is silent before God, does not say much, and does not have many suggestions
Every proper prayer is uttered not with words conceived in man's mind but with words issuing from the particular burden within
It comes from the fact that God's intention is being anointed into us through the Spirit and thus becomes our intention
We can say that our prayer is God's intention coming out of God, passing through us, and going back again to Him
For an illustration, let us use the story of the salvation of Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission
After a short while, when his mother came home, Hudson Taylor went to the door to meet her, telling her that he had good news for her
God gained the opportunity to put His intention into the mother, making it her inner burden which she poured out before Him
Ultimately, this burden was completely discharged before the throne of God, and God then came in to bring this prayer to pass
It involved the immeasurably great matters of the authority and benefit which God gained through Hudson Taylor
It is you who prayed; it is God Who answered your prayer and brought it to pass, but you should not have any place in this
God's heart's desire and intention came out from God, went into Daniel, passed through him, and eventually returned to the throne of God
It seems that he had asked for one thing and God brought it to pass, yet he himself did not participate in the result
In the beginning it is God who initiates, in the process you are but one who cooperates with God, and ultimately it is for the glory of God
If all these ten principles apply to your prayers, your prayers before God are pure with not much mixture of self in them
In the whole Bible, God seldom taught methods of service to those who served Him; rather, He dealt with the persons themselves
Neither at the time of, nor prior to the time of his calling, is there any record of God telling him many different methods of service
Rather, God spent eighty years dealing with Moses' very being; for in matters of contacting God, the person is the method
If a person only knows how to seek after himself and his own desire, he may pray, but he is not a man of prayer
A man of prayer must become such that in all the universe he only cares for God and His will, having no other desire besides this
When He was praying in Gethsemane, He fellowshipped with God the matter of His death saying, 'If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me'
Again, let us look at the model prayer with which the Lord Jesus taught His disciples how to pray; it is according to the same principle
At the very outset He said, 'Let Your name be sanctified; Let your kingdom come; let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth'
Brothers, if we know only how to pray for our own living, business, and family, then our prayers really fall short
Both our spirit and our heart have not yet been purified to the extent that we only want God and His desire hence we are not a man of prayer
A man of prayer is one whose many prayers before God are for the sake of His desire-for God to prosper, and for His will to be done
We are praying here in order that this business may prosper and make some profit, but this is not for ourselves but for Your kingdom'
God will cause you to see that your inner motive is not pure, but that in God's work you still have your own desire, expectation, and goal
In today's Christianity we often hear people say that we should live before God and have a fearful heart before Him
In John 15:7 the Lord Jesus says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
To live before the Lord surely is good but it is quite possible that you and the Lord may still be two the Lord is the Lord and you are you
The flowing of an electric current is the best way to illustrate the fellowship that is spoken of in the Scripture
Spiritual fellowship is a flowing in the spiritGods Spirit and our spirit our spirit and Gods Spirittwo spirits having mutual fellowship
When we really enter into prayer, we can say, 'God, here is a man who lives in You and who has fellowship with You in spirit'
Whenever we pray, whether we pray aloud or silently, we must have the sensation that the Spirit of God is moving within us
Sometimes it may be because of a certain sin which we would not deal with, or a preference or tie which we would not break off
Whenever you yield some room to the Holy Spirit and obey Him a little, the inevitable result is that He leads you to pray
Brothers and sisters, if you want to be a man of prayer, you must be one who abides in God and one in whom the Spirit of God has room
If there is no trouble with my stomach, then its digestive function will continue according to the law in the stomach
Everyone who has learned well the lessons of prayer always first waits before God and then slowly gets into prayer
When you come to pray, you should not hastily open your mouth to express your ideas and to utter your feelings
Rather, you need to stop and put aside your thinking and feeling, so that your whole being will be waiting before God
We should wait until we touch God's desire and sense His feelings and then pray-this prayer is then initiated by God within us
Although apparently he did not live in God, in reality he was one who had fellowship with God and who waited before Him
He waited outside the tent, and after he went with the heavenly visitors for a distance, he still stood and waited before God
By this we know that both the prayer of Abraham before God and the intercession with which God burdened Abraham were centered upon Lot
He did not have many opinions, supplications, requests, and suggestions; he was one who ceased the activity of his own being before God
Although he went up on the housetop to pray, he still argued with God there and needed God to give him the vision once again
There he even wrestled with God to the extent that God, having no alternative, was compelled to touch the hollow of his thigh
Another requirement of a man of prayer is that he must be willing to pay any price to yield to God's every demand
The first time God said Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred the second time He said Get thee out from thy fathers house
Abraham proceeded on his way, dragging Lot, whom he should have left behind; for Lot was of his country, kindred, and father's house
In chapter seventeen, God came to him saying, 'You need to be circumcised and get rid of something, for you have too many things in you'
Not only that which is born of the flesh needs to be gotten rid of, even that which is gained through grace also needs to be stripped off
Many times we pray for a number of things, but, after praying, we do not live according to the standard of life required by those things
Brothers, please remember, inwardly speaking, prayer is our life, and outwardly speaking, prayer is our living
The life within is a life of prayer, and the living without is a living of prayer; thus you are a man of prayer
If you are one who abides in God lives in Him and allows Him to have standing in you then God in you issues forth a function which is faith
For within you there is a God to Whom you pray, and He is the very God Who fills you and moves you to pray-He has become your faith
Prayer is a matter that is extremely spiritual, holy, and transcendent; hence, it requires a particular life even more than other things do
In order to pray properly we should not only pay attention to the outward behavior but we should go deeper to know the inward life of prayer
There is also the need to pay attention to the inward condition of the man, that is, the life of prayer within that man
If they stop praying for a long while they will feel as if they have lost something or some dear ones have died
Whenever they pray they feel good inside, because a characteristic of the life within them is that it likes to pray
The God Whom we have received has become our life within, and this life has a function; that function is to pray
The more we live in God, the more the characteristic of this life will be manifested, and the more we will desire to pray
In helping new believers, we need to point out strongly that prayer is not just an outward activity but an inward matter of life
Spontaneously you can touch the consciousness of prayer within you have the desire and interest to pray and you possess the ability to pray
You know what to say and how to say it, and you also know which word of prayer can touch God's throne and hit the center of His heart
Of course, if you always pray with those who pray properly, you will automatically follow their manner of prayer
If we want to learn the lesson of prayer, we must pay heed to whatever the life of prayer within demands of us
One thing is certain: the more you pray to God by this life, the more stringent the demands of this life within you become
The more you pray, the more this life in you is being exercised, and the more its function of separating becomes manifest
The more his ability to pray increases, the more his praises, thanksgivings, supplications, expressions, and even his utterance are special
All these conditions prove that he has been continually yielding to the demands of holiness which were made by the life of prayer within him
Who go to the movies would have to admit that they cannot pray while watching the movies or after they come home from the movies
While they were yet intending desiring and planning to go to the movie the life of prayer within them had already demanded that they not go
They still hardened their hearts saying, 'We don't care; we are going to see the movie even if it causes us to be in darkness
While he was going on his way to the movie, he felt rather uneasy and immediately was willing to care for this uneasy feeling
If one does not take care of the requirement of the life of prayer within him, he puts it to death and cannot pray
Since the life of prayer within us is also a life that hates sins, one who wishes to learn how to pray must also thoroughly deal with sins
After such prayer, spontaneously you have the assurance, and you are able to believe that God has heard your prayer
When he prays the sinhating life gives him a feeling that he must not only confess his sin before God but also ask forgiveness from his wife
You must confess your sin or you cannot pray, and you will always feel that there is a distance between you and God
The best way to cause a man to hate sins, condemn sins, reject sins, and stay far away from sins is for him to come before God in prayer
We are surely in darkness if there is crookedness or craftiness in our motive, manner of life, action, and conversation
Some are in darkness because of crookedness, craftiness, or pride; others are in darkness by simply being dark inside and without light
It may be that one is a very well-behaved person, not a bit crafty, but upright, sincere, guileless, unpretentious, and humble
Similarly, one who is closed to God as well as to man, and who refuses light, certainly will not enjoy praying
The more we open ourselves to God as well as to all the brothers and sisters, the more we receive light and allow it to correct us
The life of prayer in us loves light, and the more we are in the light, the more the life in us loves to pray-this is a law
Without any help, some elements will automatically be discharged from our body, while other elements will be added into us
With those brothers and sisters who seldom open their mouths to pray, without doubt they are sick in their life of prayer
There is also a law of prayer that is inherent in the life of a Christian which requires you to pray regularly
Concerning prayer, there is an iron-clad law: prayer must be in spirit; for in praying you pray to God, and God is Spirit
Even a sinner who repents and prays to the Lord after hearing the gospel must pray from his spirit in order to touch God and be saved
Although the rest of the body may be strong, the eyes will have lost their function after such a long period of non-exercise
Some are very strong-willed, so that when they encounter something it is not their spirit but their will that comes first
My weight increased, and my blood count improved, but due to lack of exercise the walking ability of my legs decreased
We should not allow the mind to take over; rather, we should allow our spirit to take the lead in touching every matter
Many people, whenever they meet someone or hear something, immediately exercise their mind to think and ponder
When we contact people or handle things it is especially important that we first exercise our spirit and then our mind
Sense it with your spirit, and then allow your will to serve as an instrument of the spirit to make the decision for you
Sometimes when they are afraid of something they are afraid to the extent that they do not care about reasons or anything else
He practiced continually until his hands became the most skillful parts of his body, and his piano playing was excellent
Any uncleanness of the spirit is due to its being contaminated by the soul and body while passing through them to come forth
If your emotion is unclean, when your spirit comes forth it will surely be contaminated with the uncleanness of the emotion
Strictly speaking, it is still not the spirit itself; rather, it is something of the emotion that has been mixed with the spirit
Once your spirit is impure you will have a bad conscience, and once you have a bad conscience your spirit will suffer total bankruptcy
Every time such a one prays, although he may be chronologically young, you have a sense within that his spirit is old
In that psalm he was full of repentance and under a deep sense of condemnation, yet you still can sense that his spirit was fresh
The reason a brother's or sister's spirit of prayer is stale is because he has not had any dealings with God for a long time
Even if we don't get ourselves defiled by it, this dust automatically falls into our being, causing our spirit to become old
When there is the purity, then there is the freshness; when there is the freshness inside, the spirit can pray
Regardless how difficult, how heavy, or how troublesome the matter may be, your spirit can remain free and unbothered
Freedom means to get out of all entanglements that are outside God; whereas easiness means to not bear too heavy a burden in the spirit
At the same time we need to prevent our spirit from being over diligent and taking too heavy a load, thus falling into uneasiness
We must train ourselves so that whether a situation we encounter is happy or sad, our spirit will not be too excited or stirred up
If the organs of our body need exercise in order to be useful, then, much more, our spirit needs to be exercised in order to function
If you can always maintain a calm and peaceful spirit in any situation or circumstance and with anyone, then you can pray
When one whose spirit opens freely contacts others and talks to them, after only one or two sentences, his spirit opens
To be transcendent means to be risen above the different parts of the soul-mind, emotion, and will-and not to be under their control
A spirit that is transcendent is able to pray normally, and at the same time, it is able to be released to the degree that it ought
Stability of the spirit means that the spirit is not affected by any circumstance but is always steadfast before the Lord
In order to pray the spirit must remain balanced and stable: free, yet stable; transcendent, yet stable; buoyant, yet stable
The mind not only occupies the leading position in the soul, but is also a very significant part of our whole being
The term 'brain' is used in reference to the physical entity, and the term 'psyche' is used in reference to the psychological entity
Every kind of knowledge, whether science, philosophy, ism, or any theory, deals with the human brain, and/or psyche
According to the present educational system, one needs at least twenty years of formal education before he can obtain a bachelor's degree
It requires twenty years of training to sufficiently develop the human brain to make it useful for human living
Thereafter the Holy Spirit began to spread out from our spirit into the various parts of our soul, especially into our mind
The Holy Spirit shines forth the light from our spirit to enlighten our mind, dispel its darkness, and correct its perverseness
Alas, sometimes in reading the Word, instead of reading the Word into himself, one reads himself into the Word
The Holy Scripture from without corresponds to the Holy Spirit within to enlighten our mind and correct our mentality
To him, there is not much difference between eight and nine, nor is there much difference between nine and ten
It is unlikely that Hannah had much education, because there was no girls' school among the Israelites at that time
When you read her utterance in prayer, you can sense that she not only had a shining spirit, but also a sober mind
Since her mind was as clear as a glass window, the Spirit of God could directly utter words of prayer through her spirit in a clear way
One should not be content with praying silly prayers, thinking that one way or the other God will always listen
When some brothers and sisters kneel down to pray, in less than five minutes their minds begin to travel around the world
One moment they think of the United States, then their thoughts move on to Great Britain, and later they think of Hong Kong
We may not be aware of having a mind that is not sober, but we are very clear concerning what it means to be scatterbrained
Always restrict your mind to not think beyond its proper limit, but think only of the things that pertain to your duty or responsibility
In summary, to properly concentrate we need to practice the control of our thinking and refuse the darting thoughts
We need to train and control our mind to such an extent that we can think, pause, concentrate, and obey at will
One whose thinking never ceases uses his mind to excess and will experience a very difficult time in prayer because his mind cannot be still
You not only need to refrain from foolish thinking and vain imaginings, but sometimes you need to stop even the proper use of the mind
In addition to performing the normal duties, during leisure times one should use his mind to think concerning the spiritual things
Whenever you have some leisure time, consider the things of the Spirit such as: what is the dealing of the flesh?
And why in the Bible does it sometimes say that our old man has been crucified and other times say that our flesh has been crucified?
Although the spirit should subject itself to the Lord's ruling, it still stands in the chief position in the whole being
The spirit dominates the soul, and through the soul it dominates the body; thus, the mind must yield itself to the control of the spirit
There are numerous reasons that a person is unable to pray, but the chief reason is that the mind is not standing in the proper position
The mind has surpassed the spirit, and having upset the order, has risen from the position of a slave to become the master
Wait until there is the consciousness in your spirit; then allow the spirit to direct the mind to comprehend and express that consciousness
Commonly, when we talk with others, we put our spirit aside, letting it remain inoperative, and we allow our mind to go into full function
A mind of prayer is one that minds the spirit cooperates with the spirit submits itself to the ruling of the spirit and is set on the spirit
Formerly the spirit was the spirit and the mind was the mind, but now the spirit and the mind have joined and are mingled as one
His spirit has spread to his soul his soul is under the control of the spirit and the mind of the soul has the elements of the spirit within
At other times, when they have a considerable amount of the elements of the spirit, their thinking is poor, incoherent, and inadequate
If at this particular time your mind is spiritual, having been trained, immediately you can comprehend and express the burden adequately
We must have a very sharp mind which is capable of fully expressing that spiritual consciousness with very fine words and rich thoughts
Some brothers and sisters are full of feeling within and rich in spiritual sense, yet their mind cannot interpret
It was regrettable that because his untrained mind could not interpret what was within him, it could not explode to the outside
Brothers, if we wish to pray properly, we need to exercise so that our mind will be able to match and interpret the feelings in our spirit
When they pray, once the words come forth everyone feels released, for the prayer of such a one has released everyone's spirits
If someone who has not been trained in his mind prays, the more he prays, the more others are uncomfortable and even smothered within
The more he prays the more the spirits of others are frustrated for his mind not having been trained is unable to find a suitable expression
Train yourself so that your mind can comprehend the consciousness in the spirit and find the right utterance to express it instantly
In order to have prayers that can utter and express the feelings withinthe prayers of the mindyour mind must be trained in the above points
One who prays not only needs to have a proper spirit, but the various parts of his soul also need to be normal
Although regeneration has made our spirit alive, the various other parts of our being are still not exactly right, or proper
It is because our mind is still not proper that the Scriptures tell us a saved person still needs to be renewed in his mind
If it is necessary to have an adjusted emotion for our human walk, then how much more needful it is to have an adjusted emotion for prayer
All the examples of prayer in the Bible show us that every man of prayer had an upright spirit, sober mind, and proper emotions
We can say that human education with all its methods has not paid attention to the matter of properly adjusting the emotion
If the emotion were to occupy the chief position and rule over everything, it is difficult to know how far we would be led astray
Brothers and sisters, we need to see that to be over-abundant in emotions is wrong, and to be too cold in emotions is also wrong
In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul tells us that we ought to be beside ourselves before God and be of a sober mind before man
While the conditions which we described earlier show an excessive emotion, a condition such as this reveals a shortage of emotions
In Bethany, when the Lord Jesus saw the condition of Mary and of the Jews and thought of the death of Lazarus, He wept
In His weeping the Lord did not wail so as to cause those around Him to have a chilling sensation in their bones
With some brothers and sisters, when they laugh, it is a wicked laugh, and when they are sorrowful, it is a crooked sorrow
To be temperate and restrained means that your emotion must always be respectful, polite, and under self-control
Temperance and self-restraint mean that, in addition to politeness, there is also a kind of self-control, self-restriction
On other occasions you may meet a brother or sister whose emotions are disorderly and unruly, like the uncombed hair in the morning
It is very easy for one who is emotional to be boiling in his emotions; hence, he must learn to calm his emotions
If we can maintain a tranquil emotion, we will not be affected even though someone beside us may say something
Your emotion will not move independently, but will have its head entirely covered before the spirit, allowing the spirit to be the head
In order to be a proper man of prayer, the emotion must subject itself to the spirit, allowing the spirit to occupy the first place
By studying church history and reading the biographies of spiritual men, you will find that all spiritual men are full of emotions
Although God was grieved and hurt because of His people, He had to find someone on this earth who had these feelings
If at that time Aaron had wept or uncovered his head, he would not have been able to be the high priest anymore
Aaron was not without grief, but he needed to control his emotion to the extent that he could be useful to God
If one's emotion has been adjusted to the extent of the above ten points, his emotion is one that can cooperate with God
His comprehension concerning a certain matter and his understanding regarding a certain thing are the faculties of his mind
Although his mind understands something, and his emotion likes it, he is helpless if his will does not choose it
When his emotion is aroused, he will just pray his own prayers according to his own feelings with no concern for the flow of the meeting
Both his public and private prayer life are altogether subject to the stirrings of his emotion and are not under the control of his will
Anyone who follows the Lord faithfully and maintains his standing unchanged till death is a person with a strong will
From the first day that Daniel prayed for his people, his words were heard by God, and God sent an angel to answer his prayer
The angel met the resistance of an evil prince in the air and fought for three weeks before he could get to the earth
With a spiritual man, his mind is sober and rich; his emotion is certainly abundant and moderate, and his will is definitely strong and firm
The three friends of Daniel were really bold when they were there by the furnace, because their wills were really strong
The day that Peter went up on the housetop to pray and saw the vision of the great sheet, his will was firm but not stubborn-it was pliable
Many times we are unable to follow the move of the Spirit in our prayers, for we are strong to the extent that we become hard
Satan always utilizes men, things, and outside activities to consume, extinguish, and obliterate our prayer life
At the same time, in our prayers, our will should at all times be able to submit and turn according to the consciousness in our spirit
Once it has been wound and starts to move the hands of the clock, it will not yield or be subdued-that is its firmness
It is not the will that is being ruled; rather, it is the will that is ruling, controlling the other parts of the soul
Because he exercised his will to rule over his emotion, he was able to completely obey Moses' word and show no sign of mourning
With some, once they are angry their anger remains; once they are offended by others they will not forgive them during their entire lifetime
Regardless how much a brother has provoked you to anger, your anger must be dispelled with the going down of the sun
Unless the will has been adjusted properly, the emotion will never be normal, because they are connected to one another
Keep in mind that prayer involves human beings performing a task, and within this human machine there are many complicated things
If there is something wrong with any part of a car, the car cannot be driven and will require some repair work
Even when you are clear, you should still wait for the will to make a decision before you make a move to do anything
If his will is strong and is being used properly, it will restrict him from playing when he should be studying
It was not because his mind was not able to understand it; neither was it because he did not have the emotion to express it
Once you exercise your will to open your mouth and pray, in less than two sentences you can cause your spirit to rise up
He may not have any inspiration at that particular moment, but since he was asked, he would have to exercise his will and pray
Sometimes it seems that while praying, your inspiration has been interrupted, yet you feel you have not discharged the burden of your prayer
In the chapter on the spirit of prayer, we stated that a man who wishes to pray must be in spirit and that his spirit must be well-exercised
Figuratively speaking, the conscience is equivalent to the Control Yuan while the various parts of the soul are like the Legislative Yuan
Although it is not the commanding organ of the ego, it is the organ that supervises and checks the various parts of the soul
Among the Chinese, some have the saying, 'So-and-so's conscience is bad,' or 'So-and-so's conscience is very good'
In the New Testament, a good conscience denotes a conscience that is not crooked or perverted, but very normal and right
In 1 Timothy chapter one, the Apostle says that some, having thrust their conscience from them, suffered shipwreck concerning the faith
A Christian must continually exercise himself to have a conscience that is right and normal, not crooked or perverted
If no, say no; if you are wrong, admit it; if you are right, avow it even at the cost of your head-not fearing opposition or difficulty
If his younger brother is at fault, he will play it down, make light of it, and even look for an excuse to whitewash it or cover it up
Draw a very straight line and be very upright so that regardless of who what where or when if any action crosses the line it is judged wrong
When the Apostle Paul wrote the two letters to Timothy the church was in a very degraded condition, and many things were in darkness
At such an hour speaking from the human standpoint to pass judgment on anything would require one to consider the conscience as the standard
Following the release of every message given on the Lord's day or in the conference meetings, the reactions always came quickly
Because his conscience was not upright, and that particular message happened to touch the matter of his possessions before the Lord
If he was one who lived absolutely for the Lord and was fully consecrated, he would surely have an upright conscience
Since he was in a state of desolation and failure before the Lord his conscience became twisted distorting the facts and he defended himself
It was in such a situation that the Apostle wrote the epistles to Timothy, especially pointing out the matter of conscience
Once you make an error, you should always deal with it immediately so that there will be no offense, guilt, or blemish on your conscience
Sometimes we ourselves are the same because our unwillingness to answer a certain demand of God causes an offense in our conscience
Even though we sing and minister, our spirit is not strong, neither do our prayers and words have a clear sound
Today, during the church's degradation, it is not easy for one who serves God to keep his conscience free from offense
As far as politics are concerned, he was innocent; and as far as religion, that is, the laws of Judaism, is concerned, he was faultless
By the cleansing of the precious blood, we must keep our conscience free from any offense so that we may be men of prayer
A man can be for God and at the same time be for the work of the gospel-to preach the gospel successfully and to work and bring forth fruit
During the degradation of the church, Paul spoke in the letters to Timothy concerning a pure conscience as well as a good conscience
Such men, when you meet them, will give you a deep sense that they are those who live before God and whose conscience is pure
Please remember, only people like this can work for God, and the real fruit of the work will be manifested through them
Real results and real power are with those who care only for God Himself, for the results and the power are just God Himself
Not only will we condemn those things that are evil, but also those that are good, for we know that those things are not God Himself
At that time he was not only rejected by the Gentiles, but also was forsaken by the churches and his fellow-workers
Gradually you dare not and cannot pray for a number of things because you know that these are not what God is after
In the past our parents, considering that we were still young, gave us some things according to what we had asked
Regardless how much we exercise ourselves to have a good and pure conscience, we still need to cleanse our conscience daily
The more you are in the light, the more you will realize that you have offended a certain person, or that you are wrong in a certain matter
You will also realize that you were defiled when you contacted someone, and you will feel guilty about certain motives and thoughts
The more one prays, draws near to God, and lives in prayer and fellowship, the more he will sense the absolute necessity of the blood
While we are still in this flesh and in this age, no one can go before God to pray at any time without applying the blood
If, instead of applying the blood, you trust in your own goodness, your conscience will not be able to bear witness with you
There will always be some defilement or guilt in you, and you will always be at fault or not faithful enough in some matter
If you are just a little negligent, there will be the accusation in your conscience, and this accusation will become an offense
The curtain creates a distance, a separation between you and God; whereas the veil puts a cover over you so that you are unable to see God
When the conscience is bad, has offense, is not pure enough, or is not being cleansed by the precious blood, one cannot pray before God
You may pray hastily, but you always feel that you are praying outside the curtain and have not entered into the Holy of Holies
It seems that there is a wall of separation or a layer of covering which hinders your prayer from reaching God
After dealing in this way you can come boldly and pray to God out of a clean pure consciencea conscience void of offense a good conscience
You are in God's presence, in the light of His face, and there is a free-flowing communion between you and God
As there is such a free flow and mingling between you and God, God is able to anoint you with His heart's desire
The mind, emotion, and will of the soul, and the conscience of the spirit, each constitutes a part of the heart
The heart being capable of having thoughts clearly indicates that the mind, a part of the soul, is also a part of the heart
If a person comes before God to seek something in addition to God, he is double-minded, and his heart is not true
Many times when one comes to pray to God for a certain thing, he will ask God to show him His heart's desire, but he has his own desire also
Speaking of a pure heart, the emphasis is not that the heart should be free from evil or defiled thoughts, but that it should want God alone
Our heart appears to be true before men, yet it is still untrue in God's eyes because we are not pure and single within
Not only will it be difficult to have faith after prayer, it will even be very hard to have faith while praying
Corinthians 3:14-16 tells us that to this very day the children of Israel still have a veil lying upon their heart
In His teaching on the mountain the Lord Jesus said that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also
When the heart is turned in the proper direction, completely turned to God, then it can really be without condemnation
Many times, in the prayer meetings or the Lord's table meetings, there are too few who pray, give thanks, or praise
When your heart is turned away from God to other things, that turning away becomes a veil which prevents you from seeing God
Also, even if our heart loves gospel preaching or the work more than God, that gospel preaching and that work will become a veil
It is very difficult for some Christians to see light because they pay more attention to God's work than to God Himself
If you seek after some fruits of your work the blessings of God or spiritual enjoyments then your heart is pointing in the wrong direction
Suppose you preached the gospel and only two people were saved, but when another preached, twenty people were saved
While other churches received one hundred thousand or eighty thousand dollars, your locality only received eight thousand
Brothers, these things may seem trivial, but they prove to us how much we are off, and complicated in our hearts
If one wishes to have light and revelation, there is only one secret: seek God alone with a single and pure heart
Also, if a man's will is so stubborn that he never reconsiders once he has made a decision, this also affects the heart, making it hard
Please remember therefore in order to have a proper heart the conscience the mind the emotion and the will need to be dealt with adequately
When a man's heart is true, pure, without condemnation, and illuminated, being normal in every aspect, he is able to pray
Although the spirit is the organ for prayer, one still cannot pray unless his heart has been dealt with properly
John 3:19 through 22 tells us that if our heart condemns us not, we have boldness toward God, and whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him
John 15:7 says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
Because of the Lord's speaking in us, we begin to desire something, and this desire is something issuing out of the Lord's words
When we thus abide in the Lord His words abide in us and there is the desiring in us that comes out of His words finally will becomes ask
John 157 says This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all
Now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming'
In the past ten chapters we have spoken mostly concerning the meaning of prayer and the organs used in prayer, or, the course of prayer
Now we will begin to touch something regarding prayer itself by finding out what is the nature of man's real prayer before God
When we were regenerated, the Holy Spirit came into us and practically joined us to Christ, putting us into Him
The phrase 'believe in the Lord,' according to the original Greek text, should be properly rendered as 'believe into the Lord'
When we believe in the Lord, the Spirit puts us completely into Christ and causes us to have an organic union with Christ
The word 'abide' in the phrase 'abide in the Lord' does not mean to dwell or to reside, but it means to remain, to stay
As you are a saved one and you are already in the Lord, what is required of you now is that you do not leave, but remain in Him
To illustrate, suppose you were baptized yesterday, and you clearly sensed that you had been joined to the Lord and that you are in Him
As you were considering what might be wrong, your friend continued to persuade you, and you decided to go with him
In your experience it seems at times that you have walked out of the Lord, and your fellowship with the Lord has been broken
The Gospel of John continuously shows us how the Lord came and entered into men to be their life and to save them
It means to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, not to come out of the fellowship, and to extend the union with the Lord
If we lack the fellowship with God and are therefore not in the light, we can never be conscious of our own mistakes
Once we enter into fellowship with God and we are put in the light, we discover that we are full of impurities
There are impurities in our mind, our emotion, our will, our intention, our motive, and even in the consciousness of our spirit
Because you did those things, there were offenses in your conscience, and you felt that you had come out of the presence of the Lord
In the Old Testament, on the day of atonement, the high priest would bring the blood into the Holy Place and put it upon the incense altar
He would bring it into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, which is to sprinkle it before God
Our conscience is purged of all its offenses, so that there is no more barrier between God and us, and the fellowship is restored
John 2:27 speaks not only of the Spirit being the ointment in us, but even more of the ointment anointing in us
The continuous moving of the Spirit in us keeps us remaining in the fellowship of God and thus abiding in the Lord
The first means by which fellowship is maintained is the cleansing of the blood, and the second is the anointing of the ointment
When speaking of maintaining the fellowship, the New Testament brings up the matters of sprinkling the blood and applying the ointment
By the continual cleansing and anointing of the blood and the ointment, we maintain our union with the Lord always
We must learn to constantly receive the blood for the cleansing of our sins and to move according to the anointing of the ointment within
On one hand, as soon as we sense we are wrong, we should immediately confess our mistake and receive the cleansing of the blood
On the other hand, whenever the Spirit moves within us, we should immediately move according to the consciousness of that anointing
Once you think, consider, argue, or analyze, you will surely come out of your spirit and no longer remain in the abiding
The more you walk according to this consciousness, you will discover that you are more deeply abiding in the Lord
Within we have the inherent sinful nature, and without we live in a society which is full of sinful defilements
If we truly walk according to the Spirit and live continually in the Lord, we will surely have the consciousness of sin
Very often unconsciously sin will come to trouble our mind damage our emotion defile our spirit and cause us to be sinful in our actions
It is only by the blood, as we confess our sins again and again, that we are able to abide in the Lord continuously
The more one walks according to the Spirit, the more he will discover that he has numerous sins within and without
The more dealings he has, the more he becomes transparent, at ease, fresh inside, and ultimately, the more he lives in the Lord
In order to maintain a life of abiding in the Lord, not only sins need to be dealt with, but any barriers also need to be removed
If you live in the fellowship, you will understand what the Bible means when it says God guides us with His eyes
Spontaneously we will be able to understand His temperament, His disposition, and the principles of His doings
It is as if in our spirit we catch a glimpse of the Lord's eyes and thus spontaneously touch His feeling and understand His desire
After we have touched God's feeling, understood His intention, and are also able to desire what He desires, then we pray
Although these verses express it in different ways, in reality they refer to the same thing from the same source, which is the Lord Himself
From the beginning we have pointed out clearly that prayer does not mean that man has a need and thus asks God to fulfill it
The prayer which the Bible speaks of is that God has a need, and He enters into man, causing him to be conscious of that need
If God's coming to man is merely His coming, with no words, there would be no way for man to understand His intention
John 14:17 says that when the Spirit comes, He enters into us; 15:4 says that we abide in the Lord, and the Lord also abides in us
Verse seven says, 'If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you ' Here the Lord becomes the words and explanation in us
In prayer we have often really touched the spirit, enjoyed the Lord's presence very much, and had the anointing of the ointment
At other times there may be no moving of the Spirit while we pray, and thus our words are not the expression of the Spirit
God's moving starts with the Spirit first coming to us and then going a step further to become the explanation
Or we may say that first we receive the Lord's word from the Bible into us, and then we receive the Lord's word from the Spirit
Whoever is very poor in receiving the word from the Bible cannot be rich in receiving the word from the Spirit
If one who ministers the Word does not regularly store the words of the Bible within him, his ministry will not be powerful
When others minister on the same topic, the more they minister, the richer they are, and the more words flow out
When he speaks, you can tell that, although he has the inspiration, there is not enough storage in him to match the inspiration
We really feel sorry for some brothers who always pray the same old words because they neither have the reserve nor the inspiration
When the time comes for you to minister or pray as the Spirit moves in you the inspiration will come and mingle with the reserve within you
Once you receive such inspiration, it is hard to say whether it is the word of the Bible or the word of the Spirit
Whenever inspiration comes, you will be able to express it with the words of the Bible which you have received
While listening to their praying you realize that it is issuing altogether from their dead mind with dead letters and is not in life at all
At a certain time, when you receive inspiration, the Holy Spirit will make the words which you received of the Bible, His words
At this point, the words which you have formerly received and stored in you will become the words in the Spirit
When the priest went into the Holy of Holies to burn the incense, the coals of fire which he used were to be taken from off the altar
On that day the high priest took of the blood of the sin offering and sprinkled it upon the four horns of the altar outside
By the following verse verse 6 we know that the seven trumpets began to trumpet as a result of the Angel casting down the fire of the altar
Without passing through the cross, no one can be before God and have prayer which is as fragrant incense that is acceptable to God
One aspect is signified by the blood that is shed on the altar, and the other is signified by the fire burnt on the altar
When anyone offers a sacrifice at the altar after it has been accepted by God and consumed by fire there are only two things in front of him
As the ashes and the coals of fire are mixed together, eventually, what the offerer sees is just the blood and the fire
The coals of fire on the incense altar inside and the coals of fire on the offering altar outside are also one and the same
If one has not been sprinkled by the blood, before God he is just like Cain, who could neither be accepted by God nor pray
Not having been consumed, terminated at the altar, they went before God to pray according to their natural man
Consequently, not only their prayers were not accepted by God, but even they themselves were struck dead by God
Everyone who learns to pray must not only be redeemed by the blood, but he must also be one who has been terminated and has become ashes
The two aspects of the cross are really not hard to understand, since the types in the Old Testament are displayed there as clear pictures
We see that no one could enter into the Holy Place to burn incense and pray to God except by the blood and the fire from the outside altar
A man may be able to pray a great deal before God, but he should not be over-confident that all his prayers are acceptable to God
Many times our prayers before God not only are not answered, but in His eyes may constitute sinning against Him
If God dealt with the church today in the same way, many would not only suffer spiritual death, but even physically die before God
In the beginnings of various matters, God was very strict in order to underscore the principle as an iron-clad law
Their unanswered prayers and God's disapproval are the same in principle as the suffering of physical death in the Old Testament time
The more you are a praying one, the more you will feel that you are sinful, and realize the need for redemption
Most of that prayer was his confession, not only of his own sins, but also those of the whole nation of Israel
If a brother or sister does not confess sins at all in a prayer, it is doubtful whether he has entered the presence of God
One who has no consciousness of sins is not only outside the Holy Place, but most likely has not even entered the outer court
Whenever you come into the presence of God, you need to experience the redemption of the cross and the cleansing of the blood
The more deeply you enter the presence of God, the more you need to experience the redemption of the cross and the cleansing of the blood
The more deeply you enter the presence of God, the keener your consciousness is of sin, and the deeper your knowledge is concerning sin
His purification is to first show you your sins and trespasses, and then lead you to receive the cleansing of the blood
Even in our giving of thanks and praises during the Lord's table, we should experience the redemption of the cross
One who knows how to pray and can pray is always one who has been both redeemed under the blood and terminated on the cross
Suppose you wish to pray concerning the gospel, your family, the giving of material things, or about the matter of marriage
Always keep in mind that the fire that burns on the offering altar is the same fire that burns incense on the incense altar
If without having burned the sacrifice into ashes the fire is brought to the incense altar to burn the incense that is called strange fire
Strictly speaking if one has not been terminated by the cross in a certain matter it is really not possible for him to pray for that matter
He must experience the blood which tells us that all those who come there to pray have been redeemed and cleansed
He must also experience the fire which tells us that all those who come there to pray have been consumed and have become ashes
Brothers and sisters, if the light of the Lord shines on you strongly, immediately you will not be able to pray for a great number of things
If you recognize that many prayers are prayers of strange fire, you will see that those prayers are neither necessary nor right
You will not dare pray those prayers which are for yourself and not for God's sake because they are initiated by you, not by God
We first pass through the redemption of the cross before God, accept the termination of the cross, and truly become ashes before God
Brothers, if you really have a vision of this, you will prostrate yourself before God, confessing your filthiness and your naturalness
Brothers, when you thus allow the cross to terminate you, you can, in a practical way, experience Christ coming forth from you
Revelation 8 clearly shows us two things: the prayers of the saints, and the Angel, that is, the Lord Jesus, bringing much incense
As long as we receive the redemption of the blood and are in the termination of the cross, the Christ in us is joined with us
There are the prayers of the saints, and there is also the resurrected Christ added as incense to those prayers
When the priest would go in to the incense altar to burn incense, he had to first pass through the offering altar
The type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament shows us that the showbread table and the incense altar are related
It also reveals to us that all those who burn incense at the incense altar eat of the holy sacrifice upon the offering altar
All those who burn incense at the incense altar are dependent on the holy things of the offering altar to be their supply
When they burn the incense, not only do they depend on the sacrifice for their food; they are also very much dependent upon the showbread
The types clearly indicate to us that everyone who burns incense must take the offerings as their food and have the showbread set before God
These two aspects of life supply-one on the inside and the other on the outside-are prerequisites to our prayer
If we allow this ability to be expressed, it will lead us spontaneously into prayer, and we will thus feel at ease
If our situation does not allow this life to spontaneously lead us into prayer, we will sense a condition of being bound
Although he fakes it very well, you still have to admit that it is false, because his life has not yet reached that stage
Otherwise, you may have learned to speak them, but they carry neither the backing of life nor the weight of life
One who has the life supply may not pray with all his life supply, but one who does not have the life supply cannot possibly pray
According to the historical record of the human race, there has never been one who labored on something to the point of sweating blood
Many times when we draw near to the Lord it is not to pray but to fellowship with Him in order to gain some life supply
To pray in a genuine way, one should not bear too many burdens daily; otherwise, it will become a real hardship and suffering
Everyday we should have a time when we do not bear any burden of prayer but merely draw near to the Lord and receive His supply
Receive the supply of life through the quiet time meditation calling on the Lord reading the Word and through fellowshipping with the saints
Although they may sometimes speak words of prayer, they know very well that they are not really before the throne of God
They know that there is a separation, a distance, between them and God, for they have not been able to forgive their brother
You will notice that you not only will be able to learn a great deal in prayer, but you will have daily growth in life
Those who pray the most and who are the most thorough and weighty in prayer are those who continually live in life
You may feel that since this is the church preaching the gospel, it is imperative that you, as a brother or sister serving God, participate
Another possibility may be that the elders keep telling you that this gospel preaching really needs you, and it is imperative that you come
We must admit that there are not many praying ones in our midst, and a number of brothers and sisters have a problem in their prayer life
Studying, discussing, exhorting, encouraging, and solving problems are futile when there are not the genuine prayers
Why is it that whenever certain ones pray for the gospel immediately some souls get saved while others pray continually yet none get saved
It is not a matter of having a natural view or making an ordinary observation, but a matter of learning to live in life
When the time came for them to shake hands and say good-bye, they still could say to one another, 'Please pray for me'
Learn to have more dealings and adjustments in the matters of life Also learn to live in life and take the burden of life
These three chapters are related on the basis of the service of the Old Testament priests burning the incense in the Holy Place
Passing through the altar, the table of the showbread, and the lampstand is absolutely related to the burning of the incense before God
We know through experience that the more one draws near to God, the more he is in the light and becomes illuminated within
Rather, it means that as you pass through the cross and enjoy Christ as life, this life becomes the illuminating light within you
It is entirely by the light of the lampstand that one is able to move and act and know what to do at the incense altar
According to what we have experienced and enjoyed, we bring Christ as the food of life and set Him before God for God to appreciate
Now when we go before God to pray even for a few minutes, we will feel that we are illuminated within-the lamp within is shining
The Christ Whom we have experienced Whom we have brought and set before God for His appreciation is also the light of life that shines in us
The illumination we are referring to is not the result of some kind of instruction in doctrine or teaching in truth
Once you have the practical and subjective experience of the Lord, the life in you will have the function of illumination
Only the illumination resulting from one's experience in life can enable him to go before God and burn the incense in a deeper way
Real prayers are not the result of keeping the outward doctrines, but of being enlightened by the light of life within
You feel that there is something in you shining and pressing you so that when you go home you cannot help but pray
Only those who experience the illumination of life are able to receive the burden and commission before God and bear the burden in prayer
Such a person may have a certain weakness that he is unable to overcome, but he does not pay much attention to it
He is able to receive a definite burden which is not the result of some outward exhortation, but the issue of the inner illumination of life
It shines and fixes itself upon us, not merely enlightening us on the surface, but much more, penetrating deeply into us
It touches our motive, our intention, the depths of our spirit, and the very source of all that issues from us
Everyone who truly learns to pray before God must be enlightened, and he must deal with himself severely under such a light
Our intention, our motive, our purpose, the spirit within, the inner source, will all be made manifest by the light
When the light illuminates, there are a number of feelings and experiences which are simply indescribable with human words
My first impression was not that he had great faith, but that here was a man who whenever he went before God was scrutinized by God
Before men you may be proud and unwilling to throw yourself to the ground, but you cannot help but prostrate yourself before God
Consequently, you discover that your only trust is in the blood, and thus you become one who is prostrated to the ground
On the negative side, it deals with us, scrutinizes, penetrates, exposes, purges, subdues, and ultimately, prostrates us
Such burden, guidance, words, and utterance for prayer are the result of the shining of the light of life in us
Brothers, only those who have learned the lessons of prayer can know what is meant by 'the wind blows where it wills'
At this point you can somewhat understand how the big wheel in Ezekiel chapter one completely follows the movements of the spirit
You do not make a decision to pray for such-and-such a work, such-and-such a person, or such-and-such a church
Take the prayers of Daniel as examples, and you will see that the Holy Spirit worked in him positively as well as negatively
The more you pray this way, the more you become dead, the emptier you are within, the less you touch reality, and the worse you feel within
Whenever we go before God to burn the incense, we must learn to have something to set upon the showbread table
On the positive side we need to allow the light to anoint us with what God desires and what He wants to accomplish
We must not allow our decision, memory, outward needs, or clamorings to disturb the positive work of the light of life within us
We should only pray before God according to what we see and feel under the positive shining of the light in us
Practice this and you will see that your prayer is acceptable to God, and that you are a peaceful, restful man as well as an illuminated one
Beginning with chapter thirteen, we have been dealing with the various aspects of prayer based on the Old Testament types
We have covered the matter concerning the cross and prayer based on the relationship between the offering altar and the incense altar
We have covered the matter of life supply and prayer based on the relationship between the showbread table and the incense altar
Based on the relationship between the golden lampstand and the incense altar we have also covered the matter of life illumination and prayer
Now, based on the type of the incense altar itself, we shall see the necessity for prayer to be in resurrection
Whenever the Bible speaks of man going before God to burn the incense, it invariably refers to man going before God to pray
Also, Revelation chapters five and eight tell us that the burning of incense before God is the prayer of the saints ascending to God
According to the type in the Old Testament, man going before God to burn incense is entirely a matter in resurrection
For our prayer to be acceptable to God and be considered by God as a sweet-smelling savor, it must be in ascension and in resurrection
That which is of God, compatible with God, and eternally existing can pass through death and emerge in resurrection
To pray in resurrection means that man should pray not according to himself nor according to his natural being
He should not pray according to those things which cannot remain eternally nor according to those things which are incompatible with God
Some may ask, 'Before the incarnation, in the Old Testament age, how can you say that God is the resurrection'?
On the other hand, once a seed is buried in the ground and encounters death, it becomes resurrected and breaks forth'
Christians should be afraid that they might miss death for whenever they go into death the function of the life within them becomes manifest
In the spiritual reality, the reality of the incense is the anointing oil, and the reality of the anointing oil is the incense
The mind of prayer, the emotion of prayer, and the will of prayer, which we have mentioned in the past chapters, are items in resurrection
At this time, if you are careless and negligent, you will feel as if you are offering a prayer of strange fire or strange incense
You need the cross to do a separating and purifying work, so that the natural things may be thoroughly removed
Also, in praying for our material needs, often we discover that we are very much in ourselves and not in resurrection
When those who have not learned the lessons go before God, they are really daring and are not afraid to pray for anything
By listening to such prayers, you know those individuals probably have not even entered the gate to the outer court of the tabernacle
Suppose we go to visit a brother who is sick, and we are very clear inside that God's hand is upon him for some reason
Sometimes we would try to do her a favor by praying, 'O Lord, You are omnipotent, and You are able to raise the dead
Because we cannot measure up to the principle of death and resurrection, many times the Holy Spirit has to pray with groanings in us
As we are about to open our mouth, we feel that in us there are still our desires, our goals, and our selections
After such a purification, whatever remains for which one can pray and dares to pray is a prayer in resurrection
In any case, the more deeply and strictly you have learned the lessons, the smaller the sphere of what you can pray and dare to pray becomes
According to the spiritual meaning, that burning of the incense exemplifies praying in the natural being and outside resurrection
Such prayer not only cannot bring in blessings, but will encounter God's judgment and bring in spiritual death
In the Old Testament typology, both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, or the heavenly realm
To be made alive means to obtain life, to be resurrected is to live in life, and to be ascended is to gain a heavenly standing
Everyone who prays must see that ascension is a position, and that such a heavenly position means a heavenly atmosphere, a heavenly nature
He did not say that God would answer the prayers of the British or that God would answer the prayers of the Germans
God would not listen to the Christians in Germany, or Great Britain, as they prayed on the position of their respective country
Whoever prays by standing either on the position of Great Britain or Germany will never have his prayer answered by God
One day the husband prays asking the Lord to deal with his wife, and the wife also prays imploring the Lord to deal with her husband
You hear the wife praying thus in one room, and going to another room, you hear the husband praying the same prayer from his viewpoint
Please remember, there is no position of prayer here, for they do not pray in the heavens, but entirely on earth
These things are very good in themselves; but we still should ask, are they praying in the heavenly realm or on earth?
It may be that you still have a little anger or agitation causing you to argue for yourself and ask God to avenge and vindicate
Regardless how much people give you a hard time and persecute you if you can still bless them it proves that you are in the heavenly sphere
If a Christian hates his enemies and sounds out voices of cursing when being mistreated or persecuted, he is surely an earthly man
These are very good topics of prayer, but not having been dealt with, you still feel that the church and the work are 'yours'
We have said that you may be able to do and say things freely at all times and on all occasions, except while in prayer
When you arrive at this place you will know that there are certain things for which you cannot pray because God does not allow you to do so
Sometimes this commanding is a direct command to God, and sometimes it is an indirect command to the environment
You are not there imploring, asking for God's mercy and visitation just like a beggar asking men for a little money
If you have touched the heavenly position with its authority, you can even say, 'I command the poverty to depart from me'
If you really know the position and the authority of prayer, then you will know that worthwhile prayer is not that easy
If you really wish to have some worthwhile prayers before God, you need to be able to give out some authoritative commands before God
If your position is wrong and your condition is not in the heavenly realm, such prayer would be an insult to God
If your position is right and your state is in the heavenly sphere, then such prayer would be a real pleasure to Him
Because our spiritual condition today is too low, very few among the children of God know, and fewer actually practice this kind of prayer
You have the position to pray you are able to pray with authority and you are one sitting on the throne uttering forth prayers of the throne
God's intention in the universe is that He might be expressed and that His kingdom might not suffer any restriction
The Lord Jesus began His prayer by saying, 'Let Your name be sanctified' , which is a matter of God being expressed
Every day there are people who recite it; but, unfortunately, the words of this prayer seem to be closed to them
There was a loud voice in heaven saying Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ
When the children of Israel were in captivity Jerusalem was destroyed the temple was burnt and the nation of Israel was in complete collapse
In Babylon, Daniel was praying precisely for this matter, so that God's kingdom might be brought back once more to the earth
It was completely due to Daniel's prayer that God was able to build the temple, restore Jerusalem, and have the dominion
God's authority suffers frustration and limitation in the universe because there is a rebellious Satan in the universe
They do not understand that the happenings on the earth are entirely tied to the warfare between God and Satan
In the whole universe there will be no more war between God and Satan, and likewise, wars among the human race will cease
We should utter prayers of warfare, on one hand, to bring in God's kingdom and, on the other hand, to drive out God's enemy
God does not wish to deal with Satan directly, and Satan has no way to destroy God's authority by his own strength
True prayers will always, on the one hand, bring God's kingdom to man and, on the other hand, drive away Satan's power from man
Every time a sinner gets saved it signifies a partial defeat of Satan's power and a partial coming of God's kingdom
The Scripture says, 'For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil''
If you really know what prayer is, you will be able to utter fighting prayers for them and cast out the quarreling demon from their home
When you pray for them, on the one hand, you are bringing in God's kingdom and, on the other hand, driving away God's enemy
All genuine prayers are of a twofold purpose on the positive side to bring in Gods kingdom and on the negative side to cast out Satans power
The more we pray this kind of prayer, the more severe will be Satan's defeat, and the more God's kingdom will come
Speaking of the spiritual warfare, Ephesians 6 tells us that God's enemy, the power of darkness, is in the air
Both in Ephesians and Colossians there are several places which tell us that the rulers and the authorities are in the air
The Lord Jesus wants us to pray that God's kingdom may come and that God's will may be done on earth as it is in heaven
If you can visualize the situation, you will see that God is in the heavens, Satan is in the air, and man is on the earth
Eventually Michael came to help the angel, who was then able to get through the air and come to Daniel on the earth
If Hades, which is underneath the earth, is added, then three out of the four places in the universe are held in Satan's hands
Being unable to settle the dispute between themselves, both come to the responsible brothers to present their accusations
The husband says how much the sister is giving him a difficult time, and the wife says how much the brother wrongs her
Maybe a week ago we were praising God, saying, 'We have been seated together with Christ in the heavenlies, hallelujah'!
Not only so, even those who have heard this brother and sister's case also become involved and fall from the ascended position
If you are stirred by a particular matter and act in your flesh, you fall from the heaven to the earth and cannot pray
Whenever we have a grievance or anger, we fall from the heavens to the earth and immediately lose our position of ascension to pray
The prayers which he expresses from such a realm are prayers that can defeat the Devil in the air and bring down God's authority
If this is done, you will see that one by one sinners will be saved, and one by one saints will rise up to seek and love the Lord
Every praying person should be one who is in the heavenly realm, touching God's throne, and therefore, able to pour down prayers from heaven
When a sinner fails to receive salvation you should pray O God it is not that he would not repent but it is the Devil that is usurping him
The target of your prayers will not be the brother or sister, but the power of darkness that is behind them and on them
The object of the prayer of spiritual warfare is not at all men of blood and flesh, but the Devil of the spiritual realm
The Bible does not explicitly say that he fasted and prayed, but it seems certain that he did when he went up to God on Mount Sinai
He said that while He was with the disciples they did not need to fast, but when He would be taken away from them, they would have to fast
In particular, when two among them were to be sent to the Gentiles, they fasted and prayed before sending them away
From these records we can actually see what the relationship is between fasting and prayer, or what is the meaning of fasting in prayer
True, some matters can make us happy and cause us to eat more, but other matters may press us to a point that we simply cannot eat
Because the matter which we encounter is so great and the responsibility so heavy, we spontaneously lose our appetite for food
When the matter is taken care of and the responsibility discharged, we feel relieved and our appetite returns for normal eating
Later on, as the Lord Jesus came forth to minister, having received great responsibility, he was also unable to eat
They spontaneously fasted and prayed in order to spare their whole being any distraction from that responsibility
If you can be praying for a certain matter and can also be eating, it reveals that you are not absolutely standing on God's side
In Genesis 1, after He created man according to His image, God immediately ordained the herbs and fruits as food for man
By his fasting, man indicates that in order to receive and bear an important matter he renounces his most legitimate right
Since fasting is the renunciation of our lawful right, we also must learn to give up our legitimate rights in many other matters
The Lord Jesus' life matched His fasting, because while living as a man on the earth, He gave up many lawful rights
Sometimes people working in an organization may argue about something and use their staying or leaving as a pledge
If you really want to fast and pray for a certain matter, you need to maintain the attitude that you are putting your life aside
They besought him to such an extent that Paul, being unable to bear it, answered, 'What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?
We may conclude that real fasting is, on one hand, to accomplish God's will and, on the other hand, to get rid of Satan
Tens of thousands in the church have received divine healing in the last two thousand years, but where are they today?
He allows us to live a few more years on this earth, but it is not for our health or for our longevity, but for His will
Brothers, this does not mean, therefore, that when you are sick and you fast and pray, God will necessarily heal you
What fasting means is that you are here absolutely for God's will to be done and for God's enemy to be cast out
You tell Him that you desire to have His will fully accomplished in you and to give Satan no ground whatsoever in you
You cannot find an illustration in the Bible showing that when man fasts and prays for his personal interest God answers that prayer
Never imagine that if your business is losing money, and your whole family fasts and prays, tomorrow your business will prosper
Because he loves God and cares so much for His purpose, he is willing to give up his right to legitimate enjoyment
Since you do not have the life-and-death attitude toward the things of God, this proves that your Christian life is very lacking
If you would care a little for God's heart, the burden for the gospel would press upon you, and you would struggle in life and death
Such sensation presses and compels you to such an extent that you simply cannot eat drink and be merry like other men but that you must fast
If a burden truly presses you to such an extent that you cannot help but fast, then remember this: never fast without praying
Whenever you have a heavy burden that presses you to the extent that you cannot help but fast, you must do your best to pray
The spiritual meaning of praying in the Lord's name is very deep and high, so we really need to go before the Lord to learn about it
In the Gospel of John chapters fourteen through sixteen the Lord Jesus personally says at least five times that we need to pray in His name
In chapter sixteen, the Lord shows us how the Spirit reveals all His reality into us so that we may experience and be led into the reality
In these chapters of John the Lord tells us that we need to pray while living on the earth, and we need to pray in His name
We need three chapters of the Scripture, John 14 through 16, to explain the matter of praying in the Lord's name
When we have a thorough understanding of these three chapters, we know what it means to pray in the Lord's name
When we have this perfect union with the Triune God, our living becomes His living, and God is manifested through us
Never consider 'in the name of the Lord' as a phrase or a form that you have to use at the end of every prayer
Later, you find out that he loves his son very much, so you go and make the same request in the name of his son
Acts 19 gives us an account of some who superstitiously tried to imitate Paul in casting out demons in the name of the Lord Jesus
At the end we should have said, 'O God, we are praying in our own name,' for, in practice, it is we ourselves, not the Lord praying in us
We can see that the prayers in the name of the Lord in John chapters fourteen and sixteen are tremendous prayers
Later on, when they really know what it means to pray in the name of the Lord, they will not be able to pray as freely as before
Brothers, you need to be clear that to pray in the name of the Lord is not a mere formality or an empty phrase
Rather, it is that when a person lives in the Lord and is practically united with the Lord, his prayer is the Lord praying in him
John chapters fourteen through sixteen are not mainly concerned either with prayer or with life, but with a kind of united living
God has separated them in order that they might be a testimony on earth, testifying that they and the Triune God have such a perfect union
Prayer in the name of the Lord not only needs such a living as its support and backing, but actually constitutes part of such a living
We must know that praying in the Lord's name is not merely a matter of prayer, but even more, a matter of living
When a person lives in the Lord by the Lord in union with the Lord and is mingled with the Lord spontaneously a part of his living is prayer
When we first heard that we needed to pray in the name of the Lord, we thought we could pray for anything in the Lord's name
As we learn the lesson, we discover that out of ten matters we want to pray for, we are able to pray for only two
From John chapters fourteen through sixteen we can see that doing God's will and praying in the Lord's name are almost the same thing
If one day he would go into the Lord, he would soon realize that he must leave all his desires outside the Lord
