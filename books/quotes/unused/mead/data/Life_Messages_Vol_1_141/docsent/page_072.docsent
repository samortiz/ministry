   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST'S INAUGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for us to behave properly in the house of God, we must realize that God has made Christ Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's administration there was a specific time when this inauguration of Christ into the headship of the universe occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is clear from Peter's words on the day of Pentecost that this enthronement took place at the time of Christ's ascension Acts 2:32-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A MAN TO DEAL WITH GOD'S ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why was the headship of Christ not fully established during the time of the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 17:31 gives us a hint: "Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God in His administration wanted a man to exercise His judgment; it was not His will to deal with the enemy directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the time of the Old Testament Christ had not yet been incarnated; He was Son of God, but not Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For Christ to be the fully qualified Head He could not be just God; He had to have the human nature as well as the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may think that God Almighty is surely adequate to head up the universe, but in His economy He does not will to exercise His administration in His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is there a need for a governmental administration in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all realize that government is mainly to restrain the lawless, like robbers and murderers; if everyone behaved properly, there would not be much need of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, if in the universe there were no Satan with his evil spirits and demons, there would not be so much need for the divine government over the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the negative reason for God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Positively speaking, God also has an eternal purpose to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For its fulfillment there is the need of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God would not directly deal with Satan, because their relationship is that of Creator and creature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So as not to lower His status as Creator, God must use man, another of His creatures, to defeat the creature Satan, His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By His incarnation Christ, the Son of God, gained the humanity which made Him the Son of Man also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His death on the cross He accomplished God's purpose and defeated His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now He qualifies to be Head over all things in God's government: He has taken on the human element by incarnation, and He has accomplished God's purpose and destroyed the enemy by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once this work was finished, He rested in the tomb for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then He was resurrected and ascended into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point He was inaugurated into the full headship of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not only Head of the church, but also the Head of every man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we are touching here is not a doctrinal matter but a truth, for the seeing of which we need to have our inner eyes enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A MAN EXALTED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Peter made that declaration in the first gospel message, he was proclaiming that God had inaugurated a little man from Nazareth into the universal headship over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us exult that a man has been exalted to the throne, a man from a small country village in the despised district of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Jesus has been made Head, not of just one country, but over all things.</S>
