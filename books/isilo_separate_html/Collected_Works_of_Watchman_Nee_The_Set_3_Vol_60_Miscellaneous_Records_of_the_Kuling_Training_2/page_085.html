There were also two incinerators, beside which were the remains of unburned human bones. One picture of a torture instrument will suffice to show the extent to which the Catholic Church went to deal with Protestants. The church would hang a culprit by his two feet upside-down and lay him on an inclined bench. Very fine ropes would then be tied tightly to the legs and the body. The ropes would then be gradually tightened until they would sink into the flesh and disappear into it. At the same time water would trickle from the ceiling to the man's mouth, which was gagged with a piece of cloth. This would choke the man and would make it difficult for him to breathe. From 1540 when the Jesuits were formed until 1940, the Inquisition murdered 1.9 million people. This is the number of people accounted for. There are still countless numbers of unaccounted-for victims.</p><p>In 1901 Pope Leo XIII gave a speech in Rome in which he proclaimed that the church received power from God to confiscate all the properties of the heretics. In Spain, even today, believers are being persecuted. The number of dead cannot be numbered. The number of living believers amount to only about two thousand five hundred. The condition will worsen towards the end of this age. One brother said that great persecutions will arise, and they will come mainly from Rome. The Bible prophesies that the Roman Catholic Church will be revived one day.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE<br />TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2><p>Revelation 18:4 says, "And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people." The Lord wants us to do our best to avoid it, lest we partake of its sin and suffer its sufferings. We must not only pay attention to this word but must tell new ones about it. Every child of God, whether he is a student or a worker, must depart from it. The Catholic Church is violent enough in itself in persecuting the Protestants. But there is something worse&mdash;the Jesuits. Since 1540 the Jesuits have been writing and propagating Catholicism on the one hand and murdering people on the other hand. They murdered many people, yet at the same time they set up schools all over the world. They try to remove true believers in three ways. The first is direct persecution, the second is propagation of theology, and the third is promoting education. One pope said that no priest would be condemned for lying, cheating, or killing, if these were done in the name of protecting the church. We have to warn all of God's children not to attend the Catholic schools. Our brothers and sisters should not try to associate themselves with them. They should not read their books. If anyone comes to you to introduce their teachings and acts, you should tell him that you know them all already. You must never be cheated by them. May the Lord be merciful to us and spare us of such troubles.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> </body></html>
