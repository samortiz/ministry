<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In Lamb-feeding</H2><P>In feeding the lambs, we dispense further the riches of the divine life to the new believers for their growth in life (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2). In the Gospel of John we are charged to do two things: in chapter fifteen we are charged to bear remaining fruit (v. 16), and in chapter twenty-one we are charged to feed the lambs, the new believers (v. 15). Both the bearing of fruit and the feeding of lambs are a dispensing of life into others. The way to carry out the gospel work and the feeding work is to dispense the life of Christ into the unbelievers and the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE FULLNESS<br>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br>AS GRACE AND REALITY TO THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>Today, the processed and consummated Triune God has a fullness, which is His grace as our enjoyment and His reality as our gain. John said that of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace (1:16). We need to consider the way to receive this fullness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Abiding in Christ That Christ May Abide in Us<br>to Carry Out the Divine Dispensing in Us</H2><P>First, we must abide in Christ. To abide in Christ is to remain all the time in our spirit. As tripartite beings, we have a body, a soul, and a spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). The place where we should remain is the spirit. If we stay in our thoughts or our temperament, we remain in our soul. Christ is not in our soul but in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). At other times, we may remain in our body by engaging in sports or fighting with one another. But what we should do is remain always in our spirit. When we remain in the spirit, we abide in Christ, and Christ has the ground to abide in us to carry out His divine dispensing in us (John 15:4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Abiding in Christ That His Words May Abide<br>in Us to Dispense All His Riches<br>Embodied in His Words</H2><P>Second, we must abide in Christ that His words may abide in us (John 15:7). Every morning we should abide in Christ by getting into His Word. In the morning we need to abide in Christ, enter into His word, and even dwell in His word. In this way His word will enter into us and will abide in us, and will dispense all the riches of Christ into our being. Every word in the Bible is the embodiment of the living Christ. Christ is mysterious and somewhat abstract; but He is embodied and made real in the Word. This is why we must exercise our spirit to read the Word and to pray, that is, to pray-read.</P>
