   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE VESSEL FOR ONE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is why the teachings concerning marriage life do not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of what kind of teaching we have, we still hold on to our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Real love means to take another one as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do love your wife, yet you would not take her as your person, your love is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it is a selfish love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you love your husband in a genuine way, you will take him as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same thing is true in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s intention is to work Himself into us, not only as our life, but also as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we were just a box, and the living Lord came into us to be our person, that would be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A box has no person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we are living boxes, and so many of us do have a strong person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of us are strong in the mind, others are strong in the emotion, and others are strong in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the Lord has some difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we must realize that the Lord will never give up His own person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be the ones who give up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord has no intention to have us live as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should simply be the vessel that contains Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the problem is that God created some living vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why in the very beginning of the New Testament, the Lord Jesus said that if we are going to follow Him we must deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means to deny our person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To follow Jesus means to take Him as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to do this, surely we must deny our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all the followers of Christ would deny themselves, there would be no need of so many pages in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would be so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we could really say that it is no more I, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He lives; we do not live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The I has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now it is not only another life, but another person who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE DWELLER OF THE HOME</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another verse which we mentioned in the last chapter was Ephesians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see that Christ desires to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times when I am a guest in someone s house, they tell me to make myself at home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But regardless of how strongly they say this, deep within I know that that is not my home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My home is the place where I have the full right and the full freedom to do whatever I like.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I am told where to put my suitcase and where to put my towels, that is not my home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A home is a place where a person is absolutely free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In my home I have the freedom to fulfill all my desires.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That means that I am the real person of that home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I do not have the freedom to do whatever I like in that house, it means that I am not the dweller in that home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ must have His full liberty and the full right to do whatever He likes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then our heart will be His home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that we will no longer be the dweller, but the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will be the dweller to make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He is the person as the dweller in us, then we have to lose whatever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are just the home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The home has no idea, no concept, no emotion, no will, no desire; it is all up to the dweller of the home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why whenever there is a wedding, the wife must be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In marriage, there should only be one person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Galatians 2:20 and Ephesians 3:17 present strongly the point that Christ has to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a sense, simply to take Christ as our life is not so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The real meaning is to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He is our person, then surely it will be easy for Him to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE REAL LIVING OF PAUL THE APOSTLE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we can understand what Paul means when he says, Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus Phil 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is to take Christ as our person by denying our natural mind and taking His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we take someone else s mind as our mind, we certainly take him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we really mean to take Christ as our person, we must know how to deny our mind and to have our mind fully replaced by the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not mean that we do not need our mind or use our mind, but that the mind of Christ replaces our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 2 Corinthians 10:1, Paul says, Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that Paul besought the early Christians not in his own person; he besought them in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The meekness and gentleness of Christ had to become his.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God s economy; this is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not a teaching, a philosophy, or any kind of instruction or regulation; it is a living, complete, practical, available, and present person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we take Him as our person, His meekness and His gentleness becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This was the real living of Paul the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is also seen in 2 Corinthians 11:10.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As the truth of Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was not the falsehood, but the truth of Christ which was in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that Christ the Person was in him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It does not mean that Paul imitated the honesty, faithfulness, and truthfulness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No, instead Paul took the faithful, honest, sincere, and truthful Christ as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, this Person s truthfulness becomes Paul s; so he could say that the truth of Christ was in him.</S>
