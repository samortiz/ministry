   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONLY BOOK THAT MEETS ALL FOUR CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After searching through all the books, you have to come finally to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If God desires to communicate with man, and if He does so through writing, then this is the only book that can pass the four tests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, this must be the book God has for man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does this book say?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the books of the law in the Old Testament, it says, "Thus saith the Lord," at least five hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other books in the Old Testament repeat the phrase about seven hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to the references in the New Testament to the speakings of God, the Bible has more than two thousand claims of divine origin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God has no intention of communicating with man, we can forget about this book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if He does communicate with man through writing, then this book has to be of immense value.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you find another book where God is claimed as its author that many times?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to see if the Bible meets the second qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us take a look at its moral tone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone who has studied this book confesses that it carries the highest moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the sins of the most noble persons are recorded and condemned without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a strong opposer of the Bible was asked by his son, "Why are you so strong against the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He answered, "If I do not condemn it, it will condemn me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This book does not let us get by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The human concept is that all sexual acts outside marriage are considered as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible, however, says that even an evil thought is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Human morality condemns an act of killing as murder, but the Bible condemns a slight hatred in the heart as murder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We consider a man who lets his enemy get by without paying vengeance as forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible charges man to love his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How high is its moral tone, and how low we are before its standards!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You cannot help but admit that it presents the best ethical code for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PAST AND FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, this book describes in detail the past and future of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once a friend told me that he could believe in everything the Bible says except the parts in Genesis and Revelation where it talks about the origin and destiny of the heavens and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I told him that if this is indeed a book from God, it must, of necessity, contain these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Bible did not contain Genesis and Revelation, it would be the same as any other book, and we would have to look for another book; it would not be the one we want.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the past condition of the world and its future destiny are recorded here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the third qualification is also met.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION COPIES SOLD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the circulation of such a book?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Last year 1935 , more than two hundred million copies were sold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Can you name another book that has such a high circulation rate?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This statistic, moreover, is not limited to just last year; every year the number has remained approximately the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In one sense this book is very popular.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In another sense it is like a thorn in your hand; it pierces you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This book gives you a headache.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It creates an unspeakable uneasiness within man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It even causes man to oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In spite of this, its annual sales are still over two hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, this book is translated into more than seven hundred twenty languages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In every country and among every race, there is a translation of this unique book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is extremely easy for anyone to obtain a Bible anywhere in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Rig-Veda were God's book, then more than half of the world would perish due to a failure in obtaining it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if you put the Rig-Veda in my hand, I would still be unable to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If only the educated ones can contact God, then I am destined to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If only the Indians have the opportunity, we Chinese, as well as other races, are out of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God speaks through the Rig-Veda, then where can we find that book?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Maybe we can only find the original copy in the London Museum.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And even that may not contain the original meaning of God's revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A COMPLETE BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible contains sixty-six books and it is divided into the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was written by no less than thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The span from the time the first book was written to the time when the last book was finished is more than sixteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The places where they were written are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some were written in Babylon, some in Italy, some at one end of Asia Minor, others at the other end of the Mediterranean.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, the writers themselves differed in their backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some were lawyers; some were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There were princes, and there were shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these writings by men of different backgrounds, languages, environments, and periods are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The amazing thing is that it is still a complete book.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All those who have had some experience of editing know that in order to put together a few articles written by different authors, it is necessary for the authors to be of comparable level of academic achievements and viewpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even when the academic standard and viewpoints are similar, there will still be conflicts and contradictions when you put five or six articles together.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the Bible, though complex in contents, contains history, poetry, laws, prophecies, biographies, and doctrines and was written by so many different ones at different times and under different circumstances, yet when you put them together, they surprisingly run as one continuous volume.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no conflict or contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They are written in one breath.</S>
