   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: Gen 2:22; 1 Cor 3:12a; Rev 21:19a EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we spoke of eating Christ as the tree of life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is revealed in full from the very beginning of the Bible, through the whole content of the Bible, to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible begins with the tree of life, it continues with the tree of life, and it closes with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tree of life is nothing less than God in Christ presenting Himself to us as life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not forget the phrase good for food the tree of life in Genesis 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus presented Himself to people as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 6:35 says, "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst," and in 6:57 He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the end of the Bible there is also the tree of life Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tree of life is our portion for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For eternity we will be feeding on Jesus Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is clear that the Bible is a book of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a cookbook or a manual, but a table, a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we come to the Bible, we come to the table, the feast, for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah, Jesus is the table, and Jesus is the feast!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We come to Jesus and we feed on Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TWO ENDS OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we pay our attention to the Bible, we will see that the two ends of the Bible correspond one with the other; they reflect each other.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the beginning of the Bible is a garden Gen 2:8 , and at the end of the Bible is a city Rev 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning of the Bible are the tree of life and a river Gen 2:9-10 , and at the end of the Bible there are also the tree of life and a river Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the beginning of the Bible there is gold, bdellium a kind of pearl , and precious stones Gen 2:11-12 , and at the end of the Bible there are also gold, pearls, and precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lastly, at the beginning of the Bible there is a bride Gen 2:22 ; God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone" v. 18 . At the end of the Bible there is also a bride Rev 21:2, 9 . By this we can see that the two ends of the Bible reflect each other.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible has been in our hands for many years, but we may never have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many wonderful, marvelous things in the Bible, but regardless of how many times we have read Genesis 2 and Revelation 21 and 22, we may not have seen these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The beginning of the Bible shows us God's plan, God's "blueprint."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a book on construction there is a blueprint at the beginning of the book and a photograph of a completed building at the end. Likewise, in this divine book of God's construction there is a "blueprint" at the beginning, and at the end there is a "photograph" of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In between the two ends there is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The process of any kind of construction is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After Genesis 2, in the very first verse of chapter three, the subtle one, the serpent, came in. This serpent continues throughout the whole Bible up until Revelation 20.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the process of the divine construction, there has always been the trouble caused by this subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In between Genesis 1 and 2 and Revelation 21 and 22 is the process of construction with all the distractions, all the frustrations, from the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This process is a story of the subtlety of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just before the last two chapters of the Bible, however, this serpent will be cast out 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He crept in from the first verse of Genesis 3, and he will be cast out in the twentieth chapter of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This view covers the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we are in the process of construction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The little serpent is here all the time, but the seed of the woman, Christ, has bruised the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of how subtle the serpent is, his head has been bruised.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now he is a defeated foe who has already been cast down Rev 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the two ends of the Bible there is no difference in the tree of life or the river of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the garden at the beginning of the Bible becomes a city at the end. A garden is something natural without any building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A city, however, is not natural; it is something built.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the garden the gold, pearl, and precious stones were individual pieces, but in the city the gold, pearl, and precious stones are all built into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the city there are no longer only the pieces but the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the bride in Genesis 2 and Revelation 21 there is also a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bride in Genesis 2 is a type of the church, while the city, the New Jerusalem, is the fulfillment of the bride.</S>
