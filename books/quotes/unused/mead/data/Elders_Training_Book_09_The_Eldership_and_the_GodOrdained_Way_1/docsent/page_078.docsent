   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 1 and verse 39 of 1 Corinthians 14 both say that we should desire earnestly to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we should desire earnestly to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul also told us in verse 12 that we should seek to excel to the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we should seek to prophesy because as Paul said, "He who prophesies builds up the church" v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I became clear that it is altogether possible to have the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, this requires much exercise and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Due to the traditional practice of Christianity throughout the centuries of church history, many may feel that it is impossible to have the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But since I saw the universal capacity, the universal obligation, and the universal desire to prophesy, I began to see that it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is the full possibility for the attendants of a church meeting to prophesy one by one because all of us have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many spiritual abilities, or capacities, in the very nature of the divine life which we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A dog cannot speak a human language because the dog's life does not have this capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human beings can learn a language because in the nature of the human life there is the ability to learn a language.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same way, there is a spiritual capacity, an ability, in the divine life to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I began to help the saints in Taipei to practice the God-ordained way, someone said to me, "Brother Lee, everything that you have shared in the past two years is scriptural, but it cannot be worked out."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I must say, however, that I have the full assurance that this God-ordained way can be worked out because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible says we can all prophesy and that whenever we come together each one has something for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why do we say that we cannot do this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we give up this obligation, our attitude is that we need a "clergyman" to replace us so that he can speak to us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may feel that we need someone to speak to us who has the learning and skill.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may have the attitude of letting a few brothers bear the burden while we rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this practice annuls the spiritual capacity of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that many of the so-called "laymen" in Christianity may be more gifted than many of the pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the spring of 1989, the Lord also showed us the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Brethren stressed that all the believers are priests, and we followed them in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We stressed the universal priesthood of the believers, but it was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offering of the New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What should a New Testament priest offer to God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past we saw that our praises to God and the things we do for God are spiritual sacrifices Heb 13:15-16; Phil 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we did not see that the main work of the New Testament priests is to offer the persons saved through their preaching as spiritual sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sinners saved through our gospel preaching are the main offerings we should offer to God in His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 15:16, Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we should preach the gospel as priests.</S>
