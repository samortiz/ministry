<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Testimony of Voluntary Poverty</H2><P>During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord. In church history, there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty. We are often too careful concerning this matter. We are afraid that we will become too much. Actually, there are too many times in your life that you have done too much already. If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration. The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions. The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years. The Brethren do not like to advertise themselves, but many among them also chose the way of voluntary poverty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Dealing with Mammon to Take Care<br>of the Church's Need</H2><P>In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took the images with her, and she was condemned (Gen. 31:32). Today, Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols. A Christian should not have idols in his house. In the same way, a Christian should not lay up for himself riches in his house. For God's children to lay up riches is the same as for them to touch idols. Today, there are too many needs in the church. At least there are three needs. First, there is the need of the work. Second, there is the need of the poor brothers. Third, there is always the need of the poor people. The Lord's word says that the poor we have with us always (Matt. 26:11). We have to take care of the needs in these three areas.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Money Having to Go<br>before One Can Experience Deliverance</H2><P>Mammon is more serious than idols. When the church is strong, it will take the stand of voluntary poverty. In this way, no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves. All those who come in through eloquence, intelligence, or wisdom will not be able to remain in the church. This will purify the church. When money goes out, a man is delivered. If you want to remain clean, you have to let your riches go.</P><P>In the Bible, we can see the Lord's relationship with money through two cases. The first case was the paying of the poll tax (Matt. 17:24-27). In this case, we see that the Lord did not carry any money in His pocket. The second case was His entrusting the money to Judas (John 12:6; 13:29). In that case, we also see that the Lord's pocket did not carry money. Judas was the only one suitable to carry money.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Excess through Much Gathering,<br>and No Lack through Little Gathering</H2><P>Paul's principle was that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack (2 Cor. 8:15). This is the principle of coordination in our work. If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Everything,<br>Keeping Only What One Needs</H2><P>Today, concerning the matter of offering, it is not a question of offering one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is a matter of everyone being as frugal as possible. Other than his own necessities, he should offer up all the rest. Anything less than this is not up to the proper standard of serving the Lord. Neither the Lord nor the church will want anything less than this standard. Everyone who serves the Lord has to forsake everything to follow Him. Other than providing for his own daily needs, a man should offer up everything. Those who lay up riches for themselves are the servants of mammon.</P><P>Consider the idol worshippers. How many procedures they have to go through! They have to kneel down, to burn incense, and so forth. You have to realize that serving mammon is just as complicated as worshipping idols. The book of Matthew says that where our treasure is, there is our heart also (Matt. 6:21). Following that, it talks about the matter of laying up riches. In order for our hearts to be saved, we have to be delivered from the laying up of riches. Those who have not been delivered from riches have not been saved in their hearts.</P>
