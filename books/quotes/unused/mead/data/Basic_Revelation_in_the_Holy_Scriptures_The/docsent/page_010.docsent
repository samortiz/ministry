   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sharing in Man s Blood and Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Incarnation also has a positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It made God and man one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nearly two thousand years ago there was a Man on this earth who was a combination of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was Jesus Christ just man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Was He just God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Bible teachers call Him the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was not merely a man of God, but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was the complete God and a perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the genuine revelation of the Bible, in such an incarnation neither the nature of God nor the nature of man was lost, and no third nature was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is a God-man with both the divine nature and the human nature, each existing in Him distinctly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Redeemer is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By His incarnation for the accomplishment of redemption, He, as the very God, took this step of making Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He participated in man s blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 2:14 tells us, Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If He had not had man s blood, how could He have shed His blood for man s sins?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As human beings, we need human blood to wash away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because our Redeemer partook of man s blood, He could shed His blood for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Still with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Son of God became incarnate, He did not leave the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although I used to think so over fifty years ago, I gradually discovered by studying the Word that the Son and the Father cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Son Himself tells us clearly that He came in the Father s name John 5:43 and that the Father was with Him all the time John 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He and the Father are one John 10:30; 17:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Christians, we believe there is only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To believe in tritheism, that there are three Gods, is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have only one God, yet our God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is three in His Godhead: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet He is one God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have no way to reconcile this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we do know the revealed fact that our God is triune, that He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s plan is mainly the work of the Father, His redemption is mainly the work of the Son, and His application is mainly the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Father planned, the Son redeemed, and the Spirit applies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The three are distinct but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Son came, the Father came with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Spirit came, the Son and the Father came John 14:17, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not believe in modalism, a heresy which says that when the Son came, the Father was over, and then when the Spirit came, the Son was over.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We believe that God is three-one, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as one God coexisting and coinhering from eternity through eternity.</S>
