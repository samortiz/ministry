There is a glorious splendor to the life of God. When the Lord comes back, this life will saturate every part of our being. At that time our body will be transformed and redeemed, and we will fully enter into glory. This is the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s salvation in life.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION BEING THE TRANSFIGURATION AND REDEMPTION OF OUR BODY</h2><p>First, our body will be saturated by the life of God to express the glory, beauty, and splendor of the life of God. Second, we will receive the sonship. Today, we are the sons of God. But we have not fully enjoyed our sonship. Sonship denotes the blessings and enjoyment of sons. Every son inherits possessions from his father because of his sonship. The blessing of the sons of God is the coming of God Himself to be everything to His sons. The ultimate manifestation is the transfiguration, redemption, and glorification of the bodies of the sons of God. That will be the full enjoyment of the blessing of the sons of God.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION IN THE FUTURE VERSUS THE SUFFERINGS TODAY</h2><p>First, the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us (Rom. 8:18). Second, the creation will also enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God (8:21). When we enjoy the glory in that day, all creation will also enjoy the benefit. We will enjoy freedom together. When we enter into glory with our sonship and enter into God&#8217;s full manifestation, a freed atmosphere will be brought in. Today, the whole world is in an atmosphere of bondage; it is under the bondage of corruption. The only hope lies in the revelation of the sons of God. At that time the whole creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption and will enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AS THE FIRSTFRUIT BEING THE FORETASTE OF THIS GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Today, we have the Spirit in us as the firstfruit. This is a foretaste of our enjoyment of glorification (8:23). A foretaste is like a bite in the kitchen before the meal is served. When the meal is properly served, there will be the full enjoyment. When our bodies are redeemed, that will be the time of our full enjoyment of God. Today, before that time arrives, the Spirit is in us as the foretaste. This foretaste is also a guarantee. It assures us that we will have the full enjoyment on that day. In the process, the Spirit first infuses our humanity with the glory and beauty of His life. In the end, this Spirit will saturate our humanity with the glory and beauty of His life. The divine glory and beauty of God&#8217;s life will then be manifested and become our glory.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Salvation in Life in the Book of Romans &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
