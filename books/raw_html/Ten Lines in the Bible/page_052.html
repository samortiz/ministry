 <h2 class="head3">11. Seeking to Devour the Believers<br />
as a Roaring Lion</h2>
<p>See 1 Peter 5:8.</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. Bringing Afflictions to the Believers</h2>
<p>Satan brings all kinds of afflictions to the believers (Rev. 2:10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. Sifting the Believers</h2>
<p>In Luke 22:31 the Lord Jesus spoke of Satan sifting the believers as grains in a sieve; this is not easy to bear.</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. Buffeting the Believers</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:7 the apostle Paul speaks of a messenger of Satan buffeting him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. Accusing the Believers</h2>
<p>Sometimes Satan accuses the believers before God, sometimes he accuses them in other believers, and sometimes he accuses the believers in themselves. This is indicated in Revelation 12:10.</p>
<h2 class="head3">16. Destroying the Believers&rsquo; Flesh</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said that he had delivered an unrepentant sinner to Satan for the destruction of his flesh. Therefore, sometimes when we are troubled by physical illness, we might have committed a sin that we are unwilling to repent of, thus falling into Satan&rsquo;s hand to be destroyed by him. This is revealed in 1 Corinthians 5:5 and 1 Timothy 1:20.</p>
<h2 class="head3">17. Attacking the Believers with Stratagems</h2>
<p>See Ephesians 6:11 and 2 Corinthians 2:11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">18. Ensnaring the Believers</h2>
<p>See 1 Timothy 3:7.</p>
<h2 class="head3">19. Hindering the Lord&rsquo;s Workers</h2>
<p>Another work of Satan is to hinder the Lord&rsquo;s workers. When God&rsquo;s workers, commissioned by God, go out to work, Satan raises up various environments to hinder them. This is revealed in 1 Thessalonians 2:18.</p>
<h2 class="head3">20. Causing the Lord&rsquo;s Workers<br />
to Love the Present Age<br />
and Abandon Their Co-workers</h2>
<p>Demas was a worker of the Lord, but he loved the present age and abandoned Paul (2 Tim. 4:10). This also is Satan&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">21. Causing the Churches<br />
to Be Lukewarm and Self-complacent</h2>
<p>See Revelation 3:15-17.</p>
<h2 class="head3">22. Causing the Believers<br />
to Have Divisions and Producing Sects and Denominations to Damage the Church</h2>
<p>See 1 Corinthians 1:11-12 and 3:3-4.</p>
<h2 class="head3">23. Causing the Believers to Be Carried About<br />
by Winds of Teaching, Not Holding Christ</h2>
<p>In Christianity there are many doctrines and teachings that are pleasant to the ear but detached from Christ. Although the doctrines and teachings are neither bad nor wrong, they are like winds that toss people back and forth, preventing them from holding Christ, from learning to live in Christ, and from taking Christ as life. This is also a work of Satan that damages the believers.</p>
<p><em>Teaching</em> in Ephesians 4:14-15 does not refer only to heretical teachings but even to good and correct teachings that cause people to not hold Christ; like the wind, they blow people away from Christ as life. This is a very insidious, damaging work of Satan.</p>
