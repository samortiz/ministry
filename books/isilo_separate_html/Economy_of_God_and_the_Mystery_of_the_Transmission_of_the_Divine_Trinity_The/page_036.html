In theology, there are four terms: all men, all matters, all things, and all. All comprises all matters and all things, and all things includes all men. Take Acts 10:34-36 as an example. In the house of Cornelius, Peter said that the Lord Jesus is the Lord of &#8220;all.&#8221; Although The Mandarin Union Version also translates this word as &#8220;all,&#8221; here all refers to all men (cf. 1 Tim. 2:4). Peter thought that the Lord was just the Lord of the Jews but not of the Gentiles; however, now when he came to the house of a Gentile, he clearly saw that the Lord was the Lord of all men. Thus, we can see that in this verse all refers to all men.<p>In the Gospel of John, the first time the word all is mentioned is in 1:3. there the Greek word for all things is actually the word for all, which includes all men. The second time is in 3:31, which says, &#8220;He who comes from above is above all.&#8221; Verse 35 continues, &#8220;The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.&#8221; John 3:35 is a very precious verse. It says that the Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand. Here all equals all that the Father has in 16:15. Thus, these two verses are joined together. John 3:35 says, &#8220;The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand,&#8221; and in 16:15 the Lord said, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; All that the Father has is the Son&#8217;s because the Father loves the Son and has given all to Him. Moreover, 13:3 says, &#8220;Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands.&#8221; This verse has the same meaning as 3:35, saying that the Father has given all to the Son. Thus, in 16:15 the Son could say, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; He said this word based on 3:35 and 13:3, which say that the Father has given all to Him.<p>The word given in 3:35 and 13:3 actually means &#8220;transmitted,&#8221; indicating that the Father&#8217;s riches have all been transmitted to the Son. All the riches of the Father have been given, transmitted, by the Father to the Son. Moreover, we must see that when the Father transmits all to the Son, the Father also comes with what He transmits. the Father is always in the transmission. This is the first step of the transmission.<h2 class=head2>All the Fullness of the Godhead Dwelling in Christ Bodily</h2><p>Paul told us in his Epistles that Christ the Son is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:9). Fullness here is the expression of riches. The full expression of all the riches of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Before His incarnation Christ as the Word of God did not have a physical body. In His incarnation He became a man with a human body. As a man Christ&#8217;s physical body is His very person, and in Him all the fullness of the Godhead is hidden. This is because the Godhead includes the Father, and since the Father has given all to the Son, the Son is the treasury of all the riches of the Father. Moreover, now that the Son has become flesh, all the riches of the Father spontaneously dwell in the Son bodily. This &#8220;dwelling&#8221; is the second step of the transmission.<h2 class=head2>All That the Son Has Being in the Spirit</h2><p>The third step is that all that the Son has and all that He has obtained have all been transmitted to the Spirit. John 16:15 says, &#8220;He receives of Mine.&#8221; The Spirit has received everything from the Son; all that the Father has was transmitted to the Son, and now all that the Son has, has been transmitted to and received by the Spirit. This is the third step of the transmission.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
