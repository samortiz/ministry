<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ELDERS' INTEREST (CONCERN)<br>IN OTHERS' SPIRITUAL WELFARE</H1><P>Not only the elders but also all the believers, every saved one, should have a proper interest in people, a proper concern in others' spiritual welfare. We should always be very concerned for our fellow members, and we should lead the new ones among us into the same condition of concern. When the new ones were saved, they realized that their salvation came to them through some Christians who were concerned for them. If no one had ever been concerned for them, some of them may never have heard the Lord's name and would not have been saved. Some, however, did hear the Lord's name and even studied in Christian schools all their lives, but they were not saved because no one had ever had a concern for them in their spiritual welfare. We Christians, especially the elders, must be those always concerned for others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING CONCERNED FOR PEOPLE<br>RATHER THAN FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS</H2><P>Through my experience in caring for the churches in Chefoo and Shanghai, I know that the elders are very busy. There are many affairs to take care of in the church life. This is why a proper church life needs the deacons, the serving ones. The elders should assign the business of the church to the deacons and deaconesses, the brothers and sisters who serve the church in the business affairs. The first responsibility of the elders is to always have an interest and concern for others' spiritual welfare. When I contact the brothers who are elders and learn that they are very busy in business affairs, I am disappointed. When the elders are very involved with the church's business affairs, the church does not have a promising future. It is better that the elders spend most of their time to contact people. It is better that their heart not be in the affairs but on people. They should be concerned for people, have an interest in people, and be fully occupied with people.</P><P>The elders' portion concerning the business affairs is simply to manage them, not to take care of them. In describing the responsibility of the elders, the New Testament uses the words manage (1 Tim. 3:4-5) and overseer (1 Tim. 3:2). The elders should not care for the business affairs directly. Rather, they should manage them. In a corporation the general manager does not do the accounting or many other jobs; he simply manages them and assigns them to his employees. In the same way, the elders should manage the affairs and assign the various duties to others.</P><P>None of the business affairs should be carried out directly by the elders. However, in some churches the elders not only do the accounting but also do many other jobs. The accounting and bookkeeping should not be in the elders' hands. They should be assigned under the management of the eldership to a certain person or persons. Some saints should take care of the accounting, some should care for the bookkeeping, and some should take care of the other records, but the hands of the elders should be filled with people. This is the proper principle. The elders should pick up the habit to care for people and seek the help of others for the business affairs. In the church life, there are many practical matters that need attention. The elders cannot care for them by themselves. They must learn how to assign all these matters to others. The hands of the elders should be filled with people. They must learn to be concerned for people.</P><P>The elders must also learn to contact people. According to my observation and experience, an elder could contact about one hundred persons a month. This means he would contact about three or four persons daily. Many of the elders are not full-timers. Therefore, they must budget their time. Every day they should live according to a schedule. If one is a professor in a school, he does not need to resign. He can keep his job, but he must budget his time to contact people each day. An elder in a local church must budget his time to contact at least two people a day. The elders should contact all kinds of people, including unbelievers, new believers, and weak believers. The elders must pick up a burden to contact people in this way and to assign all the business affairs to the serving ones. This will save the elders from the business of the church so that they can care for people.</P>
