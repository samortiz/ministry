This is the reason the Lord speaks in this chapter concerning eternal life. In 6:27 He says, &#8220;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you.&#8221; In verse 40 He goes on to say, &#8220;For this is the will of My Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life.&#8221; In verse 47 the Lord says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&#8221; Therefore, eternal life definitely is emphasized in this chapter.<p>According to John 6:10, the number of men who were fed by the loaves and fishes was about five thousand. If the women and children are also counted, the total number could well have been ten thousand. However, the people who were fed failed to realize the significance of the Lord&#8217;s feeding. Instead, they were glad to have been fed by the Lord Jesus in such a marvelous way. That was the reason the next day a crowd gathered for the purpose of seeking Him. They wanted to experience the same thing again. But the Lord Jesus said to them, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the bread and were satisfied&#8221; (v. 26). This indicates that they did not see the significance of the sign.<p>The Lord went on to tell them not to work for the food which perishes, but to work for the food which abides to eternal life (v. 27). Here the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, &#8220;Do not seek for food that perishes. Instead, you should seek for eternal food, for food that abides forever.&#8221; What is this eternal food, or who is this food? The eternal food is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He came from the heavens not only to be our Savior-He also came to be our food. This means that He came to be the tree of life. What we need is Christ as the tree of life.<p>We do not realize to the fullest extent how much we need the Lord Jesus to be our daily food. Yes, we may talk somewhat about life. Nevertheless, we do not know how much we need Christ as our food.<h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>Chapter six of the Gospel of John is unique in giving many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. The Lord clearly says, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (vv. 35, 48). As the bread of life, He is the bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 41,50, 51, and 58), He is the bread of God (v. 33), He is the living bread (v. 51), and He is the true bread (v. 32). Here we have five characteristics of the Lord as our bread: heavenly bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the living bread, and the true bread. As the bread that came down out of heaven, He is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God. As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life, with zoe. As the living bread, He is living. The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living. As the true bread, Christ is the bread of truth or reality. Christ is true, real. He is the true food, and all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food. The physical food we take in every day is a shadow of Christ. The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ. Christ is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. We all need Christ to be the bread of life to us.<p>Even though you may hear many messages on life, you still may not be deeply impressed that you need Christ as your daily life supply. This is the reason we have been studying the Bible together in the way of life and giving messages that are called Life-study Messages. The burden in these messages is to point out that the Bible is not merely for teaching-the Bible is for life and life supply. We should not come to the Bible merely to seek teachings concerning commandments and regulations. Because the Bible is for life and life supply, we should come to it for food. The food we enjoy through the Word is the Lord Jesus Himself as the bread of life.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
