BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD AND EVIL</H2><P>Four of these six psalms are full of the principle of good and evil (140:9b-13; 141:10; 143:12; 145:20). For example, in 143:12 David said, "In Your lovingkindness cut off my enemies/And destroy all those who oppress my soul,/For I am Your servant." Such a word is according to the principle of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. ISSUING IN EXTOLLING AND PRAISING GOD</H2><P>Psalms 140 through 144 issue in the extolling and praising of God (Psa. 145).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For His Unsearchable Greatness in His Goodness</H2><P>David begins by saying, "I will extol You, O my God and King;/And I will bless Your name forever and ever./Every day I will bless You,/And I will praise Your name forever and ever" (vv. 1-2). Then David extols and praises God for His unsearchable greatness in His goodness (vv. 3-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For His Grace and Compassion</H2><P>"Jehovah is gracious and compassionate,/Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness./Jehovah is good to all,/And His compassions are upon all His works" (vv. 8-9). Here David extols and praises God for His grace and compassion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Glory of His Kingdom</H2><P>In verses 10 through 13 David goes on to extol and praise God for the glory of His kingdom. In verse 12 he speaks of the "glorious splendor" of God's kingdom, and in verse 13 he declares, "Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom,/And Your dominion is throughout all generations."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. For His Rich Supply to the Needy Ones,<br>His Nearness to All Who Call upon Him,<br>and His Preservation of All Who Love Him</H2><P>In verses 14 through 20 David extols and praises God for His rich supply to the needy ones, His nearness to all who call upon Him, and His preservation of all who love Him. Jehovah upholds all who are falling, raises up all who are bowed down, gives everyone who waits for Him food in due season, and satisfies the desire of every living thing (vv. 14-16). He is near to all who call upon Him. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him and will hear their cry and save them (vv. 18-19). He also preserves all who love Him (v. 20a).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_339.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_341.html">Next</a> </body></html>
