   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO WOUND OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO PLEASE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have many young people here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to be prepared to give away all our things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we come to God we should not come empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should pick out our possessions, pack them up, and send them to other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can also send them to the poor in our own city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to please the Lord, we often have to learn to wound ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man's spiritual future depends on how much he is willing to hurt himself for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will build up our Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes we have to pay a great price to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is nothing precious and valuable about giving up our excess.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will not touch the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by giving all that we have will we please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many rich people dropped their gifts into the offering box, but the Lord was not touched.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the poor widow dropped two lepta into the box, the Lord considered that greater than what the others had given, because out of her lack she cast in all the living that she had Luke 21:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The two lepta that she cast in equaled less than a cent. It was not a matter of how much, but of giving everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some brothers and sisters wrote on their consecration slip that they did not have anything extra to give.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me say a solemn word: We do not give what extra we have to the Lord; we must give all that we have to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a good thing in the eyes of the Lord cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mark 14:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you remember the story of the widow from Zarephath and how she treated Elijah?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She only had a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a jar, but Elijah asked her to make a little cake for him 1 Kings 17:8-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Humanly speaking, Elijah's word was cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the widow was making the cake for Elijah, how her heart must have ached because she knew not what was to become of her living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The little cake, however, was not the last but the first.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the days of Elijah, there were many widows, but only one was remembered Luke 4:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She was remembered because she offered all she had in an absolute way to God's prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An absolute consecration is not something we do on the spur of the moment or by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has to be done again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may hurt us, but it will also cheer us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A joy that hurts is the greatest kind of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This joy brings tears.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We rejoice so much that we praise in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of joy is very particular; it is something that the world and worldly Christians do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BUILDING UP CHRISTIAN CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may consider that offering something to God is a favor to Him or an honor "bestowed" on Him, but God considers it as His way of saving us and building up our Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers and sisters hand over their possessions because they do not want to tear down these things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They want to hand them over to the church and let God tear them down, but neither God nor His church will do this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to sell all our gardens, houses, and properties ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not have many opportunities during our lifetime to learn such a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very good for building up our Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A WORD TO THE BROTHERS WHO ARE IN BUSINESS Terminating the Past</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The brothers and sisters who are in business and who have not terminated their past must deal with this matter as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to deal with all the improper objects in our house, all the things that we owe others, and all our worldly attachments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Selling Land as Soon as Possible</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have any land, we should sell it as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brothers and sisters throughout China from the north to the south have lost over ten thousand mu a Chinese measure of land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Several thousand mu were consecrated but not yet sold when they were confiscated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because some were not willing to take up their own knife to "kill their own son."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some in Shanghai offered up fourteen hundred mu, some eight hundred mu, and others two hundred mu.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Over three thousand mu were offered up, but the church did not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither were the brothers and sisters able to enjoy a single mu.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because they did not sell immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to losing all their land, they have brought many problems upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why were they unwilling to sell the land?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One brother spent ten years to collect eight hundred mu of contiguous land.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He bought two or three parcels at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although he offered them up, he handed them over two or three parcels at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the church saw his hesitation, it returned the land to him and asked him to sell it himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was too lenient on himself and eventually kept it all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, all eight hundred mu were confiscated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is happening to many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Nebuchadnezzar beheld the city of Babylon, he boasted, "Is this not Babylon the great, which I have built up as a royal house by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Dan 4:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many brothers and sisters have bought land and built houses for the glory of their own majesty and power.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord wants us to destroy what we have built with our own hands just like Abraham did when he prepared to kill his son Isaac with his own knife.</S>
