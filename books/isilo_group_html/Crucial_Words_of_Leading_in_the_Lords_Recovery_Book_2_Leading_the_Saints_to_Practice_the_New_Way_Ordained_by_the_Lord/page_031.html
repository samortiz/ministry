THROUGHOUT THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In Christianity there is a long-held concept of revival that exists not only within the Pentecostal movement but also among fundamentalists. In my youth when I joined Christianity, I saw that almost all the Christians in the world were praying for a revival. For a period of at least twelve years, from 1918 to 1930 after the first European war, almost all the Christians in Europe and America were praying desperately for a revival, asking God to pour down a revival. However, that revival has still not come.</p>
<p>Later the Pentecostal movement was raised up and presumed to be the arrival of a revival. In the 1950s in one of the northern islands in Indonesia some people widely publicized that a great revival would come and that even the dead would be raised. At the time I heard this report, I was in the Philippines, which is not far from Indonesia. Inwardly I was doubtful. Later, when I went to the United States, I found out that the revival in Indonesia had been false and that all the miracles associated with it were fake. In one instance when an Indonesian pastor was performing the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of turning water into wine, an American missionary stood beside him and saw that it was simply a deceit. Actually, the wine was already there, and the pastor simply acted like he was turning the water into wine. This missionary witnessed the accomplishment of the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; and was shocked inwardly; afterward, he began to stay away from the pastor who practiced deception, not desiring to witness such a situation. When he returned to the United States, he was greatly disappointed by the many things that he had observed. Eventually, he began a key making business. After a period of time, he heard about the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and came into our midst.</p>
<p>In 1949 Billy Graham, a thirty-one-year-old evangelist, went to Los Angeles to lead an evangelistic campaign and suddenly became prominent nationally. Later he went on to hold evangelistic campaigns all over the world. In the 1950s he was invited to London, England, to preach the gospel for several weeks. He preached every day, and he preached unceasingly. The British were tremendously attracted by him; even in pouring rain he would preach to them while they would listen with umbrellas over their heads. When I went to visit Brother T. Austin-Sparks in 1958, I heard about this glorious situation from those who had attended Graham&rsquo;s meetings. However, history tells us that even with this kind of situation, there was no revival in England. For the past twenty-five years the denominational churches in America have been on the decline; thus, throughout the whole world there is nearly no sign of revival.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRUTH PRODUCING LIFE AND LIFE BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>In the past sixty years we did not see any revival take place in China; nevertheless, we did see the release of the truth that causes people to receive light, life, nourishment of life, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This kind of condition has spread to all the local churches on the earth; of course, in some places it is quite thriving, and in other places it is not as evident. I hope we can see that if all of us, especially the elders, co-workers, and full-timers, are faithful to the truth, learn the truth, enter into the truth, release the truth, teach the truth, and preach the truth, the result will be that truth will produce life and that life will bring forth beautiful fruit. When this happens, we can call it a revival, but it is absolutely different from the revival that Christianity speaks of according to its tradition.</p>
<p>Since World War I, Christians from Europe and America have been praying for a revival. Sadly, we have not seen a revival within the last sixty to seventy years, but we absolutely believe that if the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is given a way to thrive, it will bring in the richness of life, and the result will be clusters and clusters of fruit. Today the Lord has brought us back to the Bible and has shown us the new way clearly. All who are saved, who love the Lord, and who have truth and life within them should go forth to deliver the gospel to people; this is our obligation. However, we should not follow the old way; rather, we need to go into people&rsquo;s homes with the gospel, the Lord, the Bible, truth, grace, love, and salvation. This is an unalterable principle in the Bible. It requires us to visit people, just as the Lord Jesus went to Jericho personally to say to Zaccheus, &ldquo;Hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house&rdquo; (Luke 19:5). Later, the Lord said, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo; (v. 9). We should all follow the footsteps of the Lord Jesus to visit people.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
