   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is emphasized in Luke is the holy city; what is emphasized in Matthew is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 21:20 says, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The question in Luke concerns the signs before the destruction of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The question in Matthew concerns the signs before the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke does not mention the false Christs, whereas Mark and Matthew both mention them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be because it was already mentioned in Luke 17.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark and Luke are generally the same because these two Gospels are the same concerning the first question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the temple has already been destroyed once, there will be still be another destruction in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The special point of Matthew is the parousia, the second question.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples asked well, "What will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The parousia and the consummation of the age are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that the disciples had a certain amount of understanding already.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mark and Luke do not emphasize the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why they do not have parables such as Noah, the master of the house, the slaves, the virgins, and the giving of the talents.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these five parables have to do with the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is one more similarity among all three Gospels: they all refer to the church and the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mark 13:5-27 refers to the Jews, and verses 28-37, to the church; Luke 21:8-28 refers to the Jews, and verses 29-36, to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With regard to the third question, the question concerning the end, Mark and Luke seem to be different from Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because "the consummation of the age" is related to both the Jews and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 24:20 says to pray that the flight not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This applies to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 21:36 exhorts us to pray that we may escape the things that are about to happen, and such an exhortation is moral in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The exhortations in the two books are different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is to the Jews, and the other is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither Mark nor Luke mention the promise of Noah, because the disciples did not ask about the things of the parousia, the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the second section of Matthew 24, there are two signs: 1 Noah, concerning the sign of the parousia, and 2 the fig tree, concerning the sign of the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The parable of the sheep and the goats also is not in Mark and Luke because that too has to do with the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is right that this parable should not be in Mark and Luke because what is spoken in Mark and Luke concerns the things that are near the end; they do not concerns the things at the very end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sheep and the goats refer to the things at the very end.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the parousia there are two signs: the sign of the celestial phenomena and the sign of the days of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the rapture, one will be taken and one will be left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One sign of the end of the age is the gospel being preached throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this does not mean that all will repent and be saved; it merely means that all will have the opportunity to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fig tree must not be interpreted literally, because this is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It refers to the reestablishing of the Jewish nation and its religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The budding refers to its being revitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Recently one hundred twenty thousand Jews returned to Palestine as a result of Hitler's oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There has been no "rain" there for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But now it is raining.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The temple is related only to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, it is mentioned only in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The consummation of the age is related to both the church and the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The parousia is related only to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 4-6 belong to the first section, because the end of the age has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 4:"And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The disciples asked about the destruction of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the question they were concerned about.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In answering them the Lord first warned that they should take heed that they not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our purpose in studying prophecy is that we can take heed and not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But regrettably, many believers do not pay attention to prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, many mistakes are made.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Prophecy is like a lamp shining in a dark place 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To not be led astray means to be able to discern; it means to consider right as right and wrong as wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verses 5-6:"For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"They will lead many astray."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who will lead them astray?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>1 The false Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his book, Josephus a Jewish historian described the false Christs as impostors who exhorted people to go to the wilderness, and who pretended that they could perform miracles by God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The false Christs deceived the Jews because the Jews rejected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>2 "Wars and rumors of war."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After the Lord's death, there were many rumors of war.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"See that you are not alarmed...but the end is not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The disciples asked when the temple would be destroyed, and the Lord answered by two signs, the false Christs and the wars.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But do not misunderstand this to be the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the two signs are fulfilled, the temple will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But "see that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In all the books of the prophets, except Daniel, we have no prophecy concerning the things of Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The destruction of the holy place by Titus is merely a symbol of the future destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verses 7 through 14 form the second section; it is in the process of being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verses 7 through 31 refer to both Jews and believers; however, it is very much related to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After the first rapture God gradually becomes more favorable to the Jews and gradually departs from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At the beginning God's dropping the Jews was gradual and was not sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For example, Paul's preaching gradually shifted from the Jews to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the future, after the first rapture, the Jews will gradually be more and more favored, while the church will gradually lose her position.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time the believers should stand in the position of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is just like salvation for the Jews today: to be saved, they should stand in the Gentiles' position.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The believers who will be left on the earth will have to learn how to flee according to the way of Matthew 24.</S>
