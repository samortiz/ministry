TO TAKE THE LEAD</h2>
<p>In carrying out this work, we need to pay attention to a few principles. First, a number of sisters should rise up to lead the children&rsquo;s work. A number of older sisters must receive this burden. The elders should also appoint three to six sisters to take up this responsibility. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 305)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the sisters should receive a burden to serve in the church; the brothers should not be the only ones who serve. The brothers should have a change in their concept. They should not think that since the sisters should not assume the headship, they cannot participate in the church services. We should highly regard the service of the sisters. The sisters should have their head covered and not assume the headship, and they should also serve in the church. The sisters should care for two-thirds of the church service, and the brothers should care for one-third. This is a proper proportion. Therefore, the sisters must receive a burden. Without the help of the sisters, the children&rsquo;s work cannot be properly carried out. The same applies to the young people&rsquo;s work. If we want the young people&rsquo;s work to be done to perfection, the sisters must be brought into the work. Over ninety percent of the children&rsquo;s work requires the sisters&rsquo; participation. Otherwise, there is no way for the children&rsquo;s work to succeed. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 269-270)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING PERSISTENT IN THE BURDEN<br />
FOR THE CHILDREN</h2>
<p>My burden in this chapter is to kindle a fire within the sisters. The sisters in every church should be persistent to promote the burden for the children. On the one hand, they should not give the brothers any peace, and on the other hand, they should learn not to assume the leadership but to be full of patience, knowing when to proceed and when to wait. The sisters should be persistent to develop the children&rsquo;s work in the church. Furthermore, according to the leading of the Lord, they should fellowship with other sisters who are serving. As the sisters fellowship more and more, the burden for the children will increase more and more, and the number of sisters who are burdened will grow as well. Through fellowship, more and more people will be burdened for the children.</p>
<p>The sisters should fellowship about the way to carry out the children&rsquo;s work. For example, they can determine how many sisters are available to be with the children, how many young sisters can teach the children, how many children can come and even bring other children to the meetings, and even how many cannot come. Once they have a general idea of the situation, the sisters should meet with the elders and let them know of the needs in the children&rsquo;s work. This will surely activate the work among the children. Although the sisters should not assume to lead or head up anything, they should be persistent so that the brothers who take the lead can promote this matter. All the sisters&rsquo; service, including the children&rsquo;s work, should be done in this way.</p>
<p>The sisters who have a burden for the children should stand in the position of sisters with their heads absolutely covered. They should not take the lead or head up anything but only actively promote things. They can speak to the elders so that the elders who do not have a burden will become burdened over time. However, they should not depend on the elders for everything, because the elders will not be able to consider all the details. Instead, the sisters should pray over every matter, have a thorough fellowship among themselves, and then ask the elders to give the word to proceed. The sisters should not expect the elders to make all the arrangements or plan everything for them. The sisters can make plans and arrangements, but before implementing anything, they should bring their plans and considerations to the elders and ask the elders to examine and approve them. If the elders do not approve of a certain aspect of the arrangement, it should be dropped. The sisters should not do anything that has not been approved by the elders. This kind of fellowship and coordination will result in the elders becoming more burdened for the children&rsquo;s work. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 341-342)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SISTERS BRINGING<br />
THE CHILDREN TO THE MEETING</h2>
<p>The sisters should also bring the children to the meeting. If a sister cannot bring ten children, she should be able to bring five. Every week the sisters should consider how to bring the children to the meeting. If the meeting place is inadequate, they can open their homes. The sisters are like nursing mothers who care for the children and pray for them. After the meeting, the sisters need to take the children home. All the sisters should give themselves to this service.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 66</div><br></body></html>
