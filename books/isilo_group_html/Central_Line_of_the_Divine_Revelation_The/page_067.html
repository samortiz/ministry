As the Spirit of Our Sonship,<br>Leading Us, the Sons of God,<br>by the Father's Life and Nature</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of our sonship, leads us, the sons of God, by the Father's life and nature dispensed into our being in our daily life, that we may be the sons of God in practicality (Rom. 8:14-15). Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God." As sons of God, we should live, walk, and have our being according to the leading of the Spirit. However, if we were to go to a movie, we might not have the confidence that we were practicing the practical sonship. I was deeply impressed when I read the story of a prominent American preacher. He moved into a new house and invited his father to see the house and all its furnishings. His father looked at the rooms and the furnishings and said, "Son, everything is very nice, but there is a big lack: there is no sign or indication that you are a son of God." Matters such as the way we comb our hair, the way we dress, and the way we decorate our homes are signs indicating whether or not we are practical sons of God. We are not speaking of sonship in doctrine but of sonship in practicality. The reality of our sonship in practicality is manifested in our living&#151;in the way we conduct ourselves, in the way that we dress, in the places that we go. All these are signs of the practicality of our sonship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. As the Compound Spirit,<br>Compounded with the Divine Nature<br>and the Human Nature of Christ,<br>and with Christ's Death and Resurrection,<br>to Be the Anointing Ointment</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit is the compound Spirit, compounded with both the divine nature and the human nature of Christ, and with both Christ's death and resurrection, to be the anointing ointment, anointing us with all His compounding elements, that we may abide in the Lord to receive His dispensing for our knowledge of the truth of the Divine Trinity in God's economy (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20-27). An ointment is different from oil. Pure oil is of one element, but ointment, like paint, consists not of one element but of a base plus a few additional elements. These elements are compounded together to become an ointment as a kind of paint. The all-inclusive Spirit is the compound Spirit as an anointing ointment, anointing us with all His compounded elements.</P><P>The Spirit's anointing us with all His compounded elements is typified in the Old Testament. Exodus 30 tells us that after Moses made the compound ointment (vv. 23-25), God told him to anoint the tabernacle, all its utensils, the altar, and the priests (vv. 26-30). Everything that was related to God's service and worship had to be anointed by this ointment. This indicates that everything concerning us that is related to God's worship and service needs to be anointed by the compound Spirit.</P><P>First John 2 is a chapter on the anointing Spirit (vv. 20-27). The compound Spirit anoints us with all His compounded elements that we may abide in the Lord (v. 27). The Bible tells us to abide in the Lord (John 15:4), but many Christians do not seek to know the way to do so. Nearly fifty years ago I desired to know how to abide in Christ. One day I found the book Abide in Christ, by Andrew Murray. In this book Murray said that to abide in Christ we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. However, my experience was that I had consecrated myself to the Lord many times, but I still did not know how to abide. Surely that was not the way. After many years of reading 1 John 2, I found out that the way to abide in the Lord is to be anointed. The anointing is the way. As long as you are anointed with this anointing compound ointment, you are abiding in the Lord. First John 2 tells us to abide in the Lord according to the anointing (v. 27). The anointing is actually the Lord Himself moving. He anoints us that we may abide in Him to receive His dispensing for our knowledge of the truth of the Divine Trinity in God's economy. First John 2 teaches us the truth of the Divine Trinity in God's economy. Eventually, that truth is the teaching of the anointing. When we have the anointing of the compound Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. Thus, in the anointing we have all three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is the Divine Trinity in God's economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
