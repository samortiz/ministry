   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Authority of Elders in the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The truth concerning the administration of the church is related primarily to the limitations on the authority of the elders in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the administration of a country, it is essential to know how much authority has been given to the president, how much has been given to the legislature, and how much has been given to various government institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If each institution does not recognize its limitations, there will be trouble, and the country will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Similarly, we need to know this fundamental point as it relates to the administration of the church, because the Lord is leading us to have a new beginning, and we need to make a thorough effort to advance the testimony of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such an advance will involve the move of the co-workers as well as the authority of the elders, and unless we are clear concerning the administration of the church, there will be problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As members of the household of God, we should know the arrangement of our household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will act properly and not overstep our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, those who bear some administrative responsibility have an even greater need to know the limits of their authority so that they do not restrict or hinder others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very much related to our service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, the church in Taipei has more than twenty halls and over four hundred small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consequently, we need to know how those who are in these small groups should move in relation to those who bear responsibilities for the practical and even spiritual aspects of the Lord s move, including the elders and deacons and those who function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we need to know how the administration of the elders and the service of the deacons can be coordinated with the development of these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be clear concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CONCENTRATING TO ENTER INTO THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the Bible does not leave us in darkness, the Bible was not written like a manual of guidelines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every governmental agency relies upon such a manual, but the Bible was written from the perspective of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we read it, we can pick up a point here and another point there, but we must put them together in order to see something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we all would concentrate when we read the outlines that have been prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have a sober mind when we read them, they will be perfectly clear and easily remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elderly saints should not make an excuse that they are too old to remember these points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how old we are, we still need to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the elderly saints are attentive, their mind will become more focused, and these points will be easily remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although an elderly person may be slow in understanding, once something enters into his memory, it will not easily be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all must concentrate in order to enter into these basic truths</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God Placing Some in the Church:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Apostles, Second Prophets, Third Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>and Then Helps and Administrations</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then...helps, administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Helps refers to the deacons, and administrations refers to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to our concept, elders should come before deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul, however, first mentions helps and then administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse shows an order to the various gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul begins, saying, First apostles, second prophets, third teachers...</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He uses the words first, second, and third in the first half of the verse, but no sequential numbers are used in the second half of the verse, although there is a clear sense of order.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We absolutely believe that Paul was inspired by the Holy Spirit to put helps before administrations, knowing that it would be easy for people to highly regard and exalt the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After Paul s departure, a teacher named Ignatius emerged in the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He committed a serious error by teaching that overseers are higher than elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, the words elder and overseer refer to the same person, with elder denoting a person of maturity and overseer denoting the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ignatius s erroneous view influenced the church and produced a hierarchy, a religious system.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An overseer became a bishop of a geographic area that contained more than one local church, and thus he oversaw the elders of several local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, elders were promoted to be bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and even popes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, this hierarchy produced a religious system.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 12, the Holy Spirit was working specifically to invalidate the notion of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not have a concept of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders are not higher than the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just as the eldership is an office, the deaconship is also an office, each having particular responsibilities and functions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders take care of administration, and deacons take care of service.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They differ only in function.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we should not bring in the concept of position and rank in any form.</S>
