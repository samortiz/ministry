   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Changing the Atmosphere</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man who is filled with the Holy Spirit can change the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When some people enter a room, they can turn a quiet room into a noisy one, a noisy room into a quiet one, or speechless ones into talkative ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are able to change the atmosphere wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our failure lies in the fact that we cannot bring a spiritual atmosphere with us wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We follow what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot influence them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead we are influenced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, those who have received the outpouring of the Spirit can turn the atmosphere and make others turn with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If every one of us has received the outpouring of the Spirit, we will all be able to change the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Power for the Work</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who have received the outpouring of the Spirit can pursue the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will not get into the subject of the spiritual gifts now, but we will mention something about the power for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who have not received the outpouring do not have any power for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who have received the outpouring are empowered to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The difference is great.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to have the power for the work, we must have the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: Can the indwelling Holy Spirit be manifested in the same way that He is manifested when He comes upon a person?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Answer: When you believe in the Lord, the Holy Spirit comes into you and lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This fact can be known only by you; no one else knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The indwelling work of the Holy Spirit is accomplished by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man cannot see this work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when the Spirit comes upon a person, everyone can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Question: Does Acts 8 speak of the Holy Spirit dwelling within man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Answer: No, it only speaks of the Spirit coming upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Question: Acts 19 records twelve Ephesian believers being baptized into the baptism of John without having heard of the coming of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Paul came to them, he asked if they received the Holy Spirit when they believed, and they answered that they had not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They also had not experienced the coming of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Would these ones have perished if they remained in that state?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Answer: Seminary students may answer, "Yes, they would have perished because they had never heard of or received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They would have been lost."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I say that they were saved and would not have perished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may ask, "How can those who have not received the Spirit be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had faith already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul only pointed out to them that their baptism was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was John's baptism of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should believe in the One who came after John Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why they had not yet received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul did not mention the matter of faith to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, faith was not their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Ephesian believers in Acts were lacking only in the outpouring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They did not lack the indwelling Spirit of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, Acts calls these twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, every believer was a disciple and every disciple was a believer, that is, a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They lacked only the experience of the Spirit's coming upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They did not lack the experience of the Spirit's indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose some of us believed many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The minute we believed we had the Spirit dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After some time, we found out about such things as speaking in tongues, prophesying, and the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, tongue speaking and prophecies are not necessary evidences of the indwelling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One cannot say that just because a man does not have these so-called evidences of the outpouring of the Spirit, he is void of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Holy Spirit comes into a person as soon as he believes and receives the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Question by brothers from Pin-Yang: Why is it so important to distinguish between the inward work and the outward work of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Answer: It is hard for someone to identify those who have the inward Spirit but who do not have the outward Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, it is easy to identify those who have the outward Spirit but who do not have the inward Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose a brother shakes hands with me, and then asks me, "How many people have you saved?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have saved so many people in such-and-such places.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You do not have to tell me anything."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These words are self-boasting claims.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They come from those who have only received the outpouring of the Spirit but who have little of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to pay more attention to the inner aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit than to the outward aspect of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>APPENDIX:</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>THE DIFFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>BETWEEN REGENERATION AND FILLING</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>1 Regeneration is related to salvation; filling is related to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>2 Regeneration is a question of life; filling is a question of living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>3 Justification comes with regeneration; sanctification comes with filling.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>4 Regeneration is the addition of a new life which is different from the old Adamic life; filling is the infilling of the Holy Spirit and the cultivation of the new life which man has already received.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>5 Regeneration is a work accomplished by the Holy Spirit through the Lord's substitutionary death on the cross; filling is the result of the Holy Spirit's saturating a person to the extent that the full significance of the cross is realized in him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>6 Regeneration marks the beginning of life; filling marks the maturity of life.</S>
