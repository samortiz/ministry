   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HOW IT WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we are once again on Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After being on this chapter for so many weeks, I would ask a few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, what is the actual, main topic that this chapter talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christian teachers say that this chapter is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, it is somewhat on the Spirit, but I don t believe that the main topic of this chapter is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have mentioned quite a number of times that this chapter also talks about sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, it talks about sonship, but I still could not believe sonship is the main subject of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 2 is the phrase, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three things are used to compose this phrase: law and Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Which of the three is most important?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you answer that life is the most important one, why didn t Paul say the life of the Spirit of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example if I use a phrase, the gold of the mountains of California, am I talking about California or the mountains or the gold?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely I am talking about the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I am talking about California, I should say California of the mountains of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the phrase uses the word gold first, it indicates strongly that I m talking about gold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In like manner, for Romans 8 to speak of the law of the Spirit of life indicates that this chapter is on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This chapter speaks about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may not see this because you are distracted by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have some concept concerning life, and you also have some idea concerning the Spirit, so it is easy for you to pick up these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But you don t have any concept, any idea, concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not many Christian readers of Romans 8 would pick up the word law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of them have already picked up the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fewer have picked up life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THREE LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the past we picked up the word life, but we didn t spend too much time to emphasize the word law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This chapter actually talks about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Don t forget that Romans 8 is a continuation of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 7 talks about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, it talks about at least three laws: first, there is God s law given through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, there is a kind of law trying to do good in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then there is another law, an evil, bad law in our members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So Romans 7 shows our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the law of God given outwardly, and surely as a human being created by God, we would like to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have such a law in our created nature of trying, even endeavoring, to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But, between these two laws the law given by God and the law created in us in our natural life there is another evil law which is also called evil Rom 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we try to do good, to keep the law of God, we find that evil is present.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This causes the trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no way for a fallen person with such an evil law inside him to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is clearly described in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then Romans 8 says that there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because there is another law, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not the law of good nor the law of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not even the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is another law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law of the Spirit of life has freed me from that evil law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By this, you can see that the topic of chapter eight is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although it has more than thirty verses, you have to realize all the verses in chapter eight are just a full definition of this fourth law, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This fourth law is absolutely different from the other three laws from God s law, from the law of good, and from the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Knowledge of Life, there is a chapter on three lives and four laws.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That chapter defines clearly these four laws, but it doesn t stress what is the subject of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this message I must stress this one thing, that is, Romans 8 talks about a law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not the law of God, nor the law of good, nor the law of evil, but the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we need to ask some further and harder questions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, what is this law?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second, how does this law work?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Third, what is the issue of this law?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These three questions are not so easy for anyone to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must not take these three questions in such an easy or a light way.</S>
