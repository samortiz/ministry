   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. Helping Others To Receive Burdens</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders should not only help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems, but should also help them in a definite way to receive some burdens from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They should not merely receive a general burden, but a burden to be a responsible one in a district, or to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although you are simply an elder, and not an apostle, you can still help them to receive such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have been perfected to a certain extent and should receive a certain burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here you have to render them some help.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, this cannot be done in three or five words; there is the need for a long period of fellowshipping with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, you need to contact them many times, fellowship with them much, touch their hearts, and know their feelings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, you have to pray for them always, to touch the Lord's feeling and the Lord's will regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Gradually and naturally, you will be able to help them to receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only do you have to bring them into the service and to accept the arrangements in the service of the church, you have to help them to have some genuine coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The so-called arrangements are often quite shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They only afford people an opportunity to learn something and receive some grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, this may not be the coordination in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, a brother or sister may be brought into the ushering service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may feel that he or she has entered the service, but there may not be any genuine coordination yet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You still have to spend time with this one, to help him or her to have some dealings before the Lord, to grow, and to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Up to a time, his condition will be different from what it was when he first joined the service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he first began to serve, he was unconcerned; he was saved, and he had a little love and was a little revived.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he was assigned to the ushering service, or the cleaning service, or the business-office service, he merely did the job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now as an elder, you have worked with him, perfected him, and helped him again and again; he has been brought on to quite an extent and has reached quite a standard before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this time, he will have a definite burden in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will not only have some general and inconsequential services.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will not only be receiving a notice from others informing him of his assignment, whether it is gospel visitation, visitation of the saints, business-office duty, record keeping, or bookkeeping, and going along with such an assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now he has gone through some dealings and has learned something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has reached a state where something has taken form.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He should now accept a definite burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this time, he has been brought into the service by you practically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may receive a burden to be a district responsible one, taking care of a district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or he may receive a burden to be a minister of the Word or a gospel preacher for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to bring someone on in life before God and to help him to receive a definite burden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I say again that you cannot be too objective or too spiritual on their behalf in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some see another who has tuberculosis and say, "Brother, just look to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or they see a sister who has an ulcer and say, "Sister, you should trust the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, when they themselves have tuberculosis, they go to the doctor faster than anyone else!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is of no use to have faith for others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is likewise useless to say light-hearted words and to take an objective stand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must place yourself in their position, and consider their situation as if you are right there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The whole New Testament shows that other than the twelve apostles who were helped by the Lord Jesus in the flesh, you can hardly find another one who was called to serve the Lord like Paul, who was directly perfected by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if you read Paul's teaching, you will find out that he was always charging the responsible ones in the church to learn to help others and perfect them in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Men like Timothy and Titus were all perfected by the church and by the men of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we must never neglect this matter.</S>
