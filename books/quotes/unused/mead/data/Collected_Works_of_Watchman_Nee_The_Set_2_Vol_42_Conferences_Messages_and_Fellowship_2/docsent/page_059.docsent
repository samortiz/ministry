   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONFERENCE IN FOOCHOW,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DECEMBER 1936 CHAPTER FORTY-NINE TALKS 1 Date: December 12, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: In front of the Foochow Gospel Hospital</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Dr. Wu asked: How can we love our enemies? Sometimes I treat a certain person well, but he is evil to me in return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: You have to know that you can never love your enemies by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You will always hate your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should never think that you can love your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not surprising at all to hear you say that you cannot love your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, it would be a surprise if you had said that you can love your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord did not give the teaching on the mount for men to keep, but for them to break.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither did God give the law to men for them to keep, but for them to break.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God gave so many commandments to men and the Lord spoke the teachings on the mount in order to show men that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only one person can keep the law Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only Christ can meet God's demands; only He can keep God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are two salvations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One relates to the Lord dying on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The other relates to the Lord living within us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord tells us that we can never carry out the commandments in Matthew 5 through 7 by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the One who is living within us can fulfill His commandments for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 5:16 the Lord said, "In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that the good works are done by God and not by men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why men glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Mr. Chu delivers a good message, there is no reason that men should give glory to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they glorified me, that would be the greatest joke on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Men glorify the Father for our good works because good works originate from God Himself and not from us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With man this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But with God nothing is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank God that His Son can love enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you receive the Lord into your heart and allow Him to love your enemies, there will no longer be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mrs. Zia asked: How can we know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Answer: If you walk according to your own will throughout the year and only inquire of God in moments of life and death, it will be difficult for you to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you want to know God's will, you must first make the matter of doing His will your lifelong goal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then you will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Understanding God's will does not depend on a method but on the person involved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No method will work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You should ask whether a person like yourself can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psalm 32:9 says, "Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding;/Whose trappings consist of bit and bridle to constrain them,/Else they do not come near you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can speak to those whom we know well with our eyes, but to those whom we do not know well, we can only speak with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we know God well, He will speak to us with His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we have to learn to have a very intimate relationship with the Lord and not allow any barrier to exist between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we fulfill these conditions, it will be easy for us to know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Philippians 2 says that we should have the mind of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to know God's will, we must also have the mind of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Having His mind means that there is no barrier between us and the Lord; it means allowing no sin to remain between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who do not have the Lord's mind will not have God's will in them either.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to learn to always follow the Lord's leading within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are two aspects to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first is the inner urging, and the second is the inner forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must learn to follow both kinds of leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is impossible to know God's will without being familiar with these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have learned your lesson well, the Lord will reveal His will to you and show you what to do when problems arise.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you do not have the mind of Christ Jesus, you will never have the outward leading of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When problems arise, you must not only deal with symptoms, you must deal with the root.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your whole being needs to experience a thorough turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must have the mind of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You must draw near to Him, and there must not be any barrier between you and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you do this, you will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sister Tzi-mei asked: Sometimes I feel clear that something is according to the Lord's will, yet circumstantially there are obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Answer: If you are certain that something is according to the Lord's will, but there is authority above you, such as your parents or husband, forcing you to act otherwise, you should still submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was a man from the China Inland Mission who wanted to come to China for the gospel, but his parents would not allow him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He submitted to his parents eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If something is according to God's will, He will be responsible for working out the necessary environment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No one can receive God's blessing without submitting to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you first submit and then ask God to deal with the other person, you will see the other person change.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Except for those with authority, you should ignore any obstacle that comes from man or things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the obstacle is from man or things, you should obey God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>During the First World War, a company of soldiers was ordered to defend a hill.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There was no military justification for defending it, but the soldiers took the order and defended it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Within two hours, the whole company was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether a decision is right or wrong is not our business.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our duty is only to ask if something is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If it is, it is our responsibility to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is God's responsibility to take care of the result of our obedience to His will.</S>
