Unfortunately, to many, spirit is an indefinable term, meaning anything metaphysical, anything beyond the realm of our five senses
The words for spirit in the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek, also come from words meaning 'to breathe'
From another perspective, as Spirit, God is wondrously available to man, as available as the very air that man breathes
Understanding that God as the Spirit is both important and available to man, we should consider what the Bible tells us about God the Spirit
God is the Divine Being and God is the available Spirit; hence, God's divine nature is available for man to partake of
In the Bible God the Spirit is referred to in many ways, but here we need only consider three of these titles to see God's availability
Among His many titles in the Bible, the Divine Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit
These three titles tell us much about how God intends to be related to man and are hence worthy of our consideration
God is not only a self-existing Being, but wondrously the Divine Being who makes Himself available to us His creatures as the Spirit
The term the Spirit of God is a common designation of God in the Bible, but it is primarily used in the Old Testament
Throughout the Old Testament the Spirit of God appears, in every case referring to God coming to man and applying Himself to man's situation
He is the Spirit of God because He is the Spirit of the Divine Being, bearing His divinity to man and applying it to man's situation
The apostle Paul says, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you'
As such, He is not only the Divine Spirit but also the Spirit of all that God is, covenanted to His chosen people and applied to them
We often think of holiness as religious piety but as applied to God holiness is the unique attribute of God that separates Him from all else
Everything in the universe shares something in common with everything else; all things are at least created by God
The Holy Spirit is God the Spirit coming to man to apply God's holy, divine nature to man that man may be holy as God is
The God-man Jesus Christ was frequently called the Holy One because, being conceived and born of the Holy Spirit , He too was holy
Those who believe in Christ were chosen to be holy, that is, to have God's divine life and holy nature and therefore be God's sons
