<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(15)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 22:1-12; 25:4; 23:1-8</H1><P>In this message we will cover the general statutes and judgments concerning taking care of others' interests, concerning mixtures of any kind, concerning the sparing of the producing animals, and concerning the losing of the right to enter the congregation of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Concerning Taking Care of Others' Interests</H2><P>In 22:1-4, 8 we have a word concerning taking care of others' interests.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. An Israelite Not Neglecting<br>His Brother's Straying Ox or Sheep<br>but Returning Them to His Brother</H2><P>An Israelite was not to see his brother's ox or sheep straying and neglect them; he was to return them to his brother (v. 1).</P><P>The word brother in 22:1 indicates that, in the sight of God, all the children of Israel were members of one family. The entire nation was a great family. The straying ox or sheep was an animal belonging not merely to another man but to one's brother. To return such a straying ox or sheep to the brother was to take care of the brother's interests. Among us today, there should be the practice of caring for the interests of the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Brother Not Being Nearby<br>or Not Being Known and an Israelite<br>Bringing the Straying Ox or Sheep<br>to His Own House<br>until His Brother Demanded It</H2><P>If his brother was not nearby him, or if he did not know who he was, the Israelite was to bring the straying ox or sheep to his own house until his brother demanded it (v. 2a). Then he was to return it to him (v. 2b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. An Israelite Not Neglecting<br>His Brother's Donkey, Clothing,<br>or Any of His Brother's Lost Things</H2><P>"Thus shall you do with his donkey; and thus shall you do with his clothing; and thus shall you do with any of your brother's lost things, which he has lost and you have found. You may not neglect them" (v. 3). This indicates that an Israelite who found any of his brother's lost things was to take care of it for him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. An Israelite Not Neglecting<br>His Brother's Donkey or Ox<br>Which Had Fallen by the Way</H2><P>An Israelite was not to see his brother's donkey or ox fallen by the way and neglect them; he had to lift them up with the brother (v. 4). In such a case, the owner was present, but he needed help to lift up the donkey or ox.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. When Building a New House,<br>an Israelite Making a Low Wall<br>around the Edge of His Roof</H2><P>When an Israelite built a new house, he was to make a low wall around the edge of his roof so that he did not put the guilt of blood on his house if someone fell from it (v. 8). In those days, the houses had flat roofs. A low wall around the edge of the roof could protect a person from falling from the roof.</P>
