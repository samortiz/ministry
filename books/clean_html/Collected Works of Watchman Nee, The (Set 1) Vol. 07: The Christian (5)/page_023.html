<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16, April 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN TEL AVIV</H2><P>Seventeen years ago, Tel Aviv (near Joppa) was just a plot of sand. Now it has become a new city. Most of the Jews in Palestine live here. The population is about forty-three thousand. All of them speak Hebrew. The government in Palestine has built a major railway between Tel Aviv and ______.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NUMBER OF JEWS ENTERING PALESTINE</H2><P>Before September 8, 1926, there were twenty-one thousand Jews who had entered Palestine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE JEWS LIVING IN PALESTINE</H2><P>"The organization responsible for the settling of Jewish families in Palestine...has an agenda for the next ten years: once every year it will resettle about thirty thousand Jews in Palestine." (This is an excerpt from a speech by Mr. ______ in the German Zionist conference.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONVENIENCE OF TRANSPORTATION</H2><P>Now between Jerusalem and ______, there are regularly scheduled buses. The journey takes three and a half days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SHAKE-UP IN THE THINGS OF NATURE</H2><P>During the past year, the news has been filled with reports of natural calamities. In some places there were earthquakes. One record said that there was not a single day in 1926 when there was not an earthquake somewhere. South Florida was damaged by storms and torrential rain. Thousands of homes were deluged, and a few million homes were damaged and suffered great destruction. In addition, countless persons were injured. No one knows what has happened to the universe. According to their common theory, scientists think that the calamities came from the black spots in the sun. However, no one knows this definitely. The prophet Haggai spoke of the Lord overthrowing the throne of kingdoms and the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen (Hag. 2:22). The Scripture also says, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven" (Heb. 12:26). These changes in nature are but a warning to us and a sign that tells us that the end is near. It is also an indication of the suffering that will quickly come to the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO CHANGE IN EUROPE</H2><P>Although there is the work of the ______ treaty and the alliance of the nations, the political situation in Europe still has not improved. Some have suggested that if the United States would write off some of its loans, there would be some positive results. But others have said that this is useless. Mussolini is still the conspicuous character on the Continent. His friendship with the Vatican is becoming more and more apparent. All the other politicians in Europe seem to be afraid of this boyish and amazing Italian. Recently, we have not heard much about his ambitious desire to recover the former glories of Rome and to be the master of Europe. Everywhere in Europe, there are still intense preparations for war. World peace and disarmament are nowhere to be seen. Some have written something in the newspaper roughly along the following lines: "The preservation of peace is the great problem we are faced with today. While this question is very obvious, yet the obvious questions are many times the hardest to solve. Disarmament will surely avert wars. But will they not be able to build up arms again even after they have disarmed themselves? Recent experiences have shown that the works and plans of the League of Nations have failed; it can no longer maintain world peace. What we need today is the concerted efforts of good-intentioned, wise, capable, and moral leaders." We have heard comments such as these over and over again. They are completely meaningless. All of this unrest proves that God's word is real. In the old days, He had already foretold the conditions of today. This world will not have peace until the Lord comes back to reign on earth and to begin His righteous and just rule.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHANGES IN JERUSALEM</H2><P>Jerusalem is changing rapidly. Steady improvements have not only expanded the original suburbs, but have opened up new suburbs. The waterworks of ______ have been prepared in a good way, and last summer there was no lack of water. Water in the houses and on the streets flows easily, and there is no blockage anywhere. The streets have been widened and repaved. Joppa Road is a major street in Jerusalem. Previously, it was a street which was famous for being muddy in winter and for being dusty in summer. Now it is up to the standard for a capital city. Many of the long-awaited houses are also being built, although up to now most are built only on the main streets. The central post office has also been erected in a beautiful way. The city is full of new houses, with water, electricity, and sanitary facilities. All the new dwellers are happy and satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVING JEWS</H2><P>According to the report of the manager's office of the Jewish Telegraph, since the European War, there are twenty thousand believers in ______.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SILK FARMING</H2><P>The Jewish government has ordered officers everywhere in the Jewish land to increase the cultivation of silkworms, and it has promised the villagers that it will promote the supply for this business and furnish information on the modern cultivation of silkworms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TELEPHONES</H2><P>On August 19, Jerusalem announced that Palestine and Syria will soon be able to communicate with each other via telephone. The telephone exchange will be situated at the very north of the Jewish residential settlement in Palestineâ€”_______ and the near-by boundary to Lebanon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXXXXXX</H2><P>According to ______, the XXXXXXXX is the Kadesh-Barnea where the Israelites of old pitched their camp during their wandering in the wilderness. It is also the place where Moses struck the rock to get water. In these days, there is still water coming out from the creeks there. In the whole Sinai wilderness, this kind of creek is only found here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AGRICULTURE</H2><P>In order to meet the need of the new colonies near ______, and in order to irrigate the whole Jewish land, many proposals have been made. According to the request of the agricultural department, the Zionist convention has advanced three hundred fifty thousand dollars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REVIVING OF PALESTINE</H2><P>A certain person who has recently returned from Palestine after a few weeks' stay discussed the wonders of the rebuilding of Palestine: "I have investigated some cities and colonies, thirty in all. I cannot describe with words how I have been impressed." The rabbi also said that there will be a bumper crop this year in Palestine, that the crises in Tel Aviv and other places were but temporary, and that they are over by now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY</H2><P>According to modern Jewish lawyers, the University in Jerusalem is progressing very well. The Jews are famous for their intelligence not only in Palestine, but in the whole world. Recently, the director of the Hebrew University has gathered together representatives of all the Zionist organizations throughout the world. According to their recent records, all the Jewish students throughout Europe have been very interested in the development of the Hebrew University and have placed high hopes in it. The director said that these students consider this university to be the means to uplift Judaism and to succeed in bringing forth new knowledge. They see this as a center for the revival of Judaism and as the means to make Palestine once more the center of academic learning. He also reported that subjects in the humanities are continually expanding, and that other schools have similar progress. The agricultural lab of this university has already performed some crucial experiments, the result of which will bring major contributions to the national agriculture. According to the director, the library of the university has been much developed; the value of its treasures and the number of volumes of its books can match any library in Europe.</P>
