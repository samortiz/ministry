<P>The New Testament charges us to believe into Christ, the Son. Many will not translate this Greek word as into, because they say that this is not good English. They maintain that into should be translated as in. In other words, we are to believe in Christ. The word in, however, should actually be translated as into. We do not merely believe in Christ; we believe into Christ. To believe into Christ is to receive Him and be united with Him as one. The word into conveys this divine revelation.</P><P>The writer of a book entitled Bone of His Bone quotes Jessie Penn-Lewis as saying that the Greek text of John 3:16 conveys a different meaning from our English versions. It is not he who believes in Christ but he who believes into Him who shall have eternal life. Then the author goes on to say that the Christian life is not an imitation of Christ but a participation in Christ. To believe into Christ is to be united with Christ as one. This shows that in speaking of the divine things in God's economy, we should not be bound by language. Language should be managed by us to serve our purpose in the culture.</P><P>The New Testament says that we should believe into Christ. Noah and his family could not have been saved if they had merely relied upon the ark outwardly. They had to enter into the ark. This is a picture of our believing into Christ. We were once outside of Christ. We were born in Adam, but we were outside of Christ. We needed to take a step to get into Him. The first step was our believing into Christ, and the following step was our being baptized into Christ. Through our believing and being baptized, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. Now we are in Christ.</P><P>This brief fellowship should help us to see the standard of God's New Testament economy in comparison with the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in Psalms 25&#151;41. While the psalmist was enjoying God in God's house, he expressed his sentiment, and his expressions were a mixture. In this message we want to see these mixed expressions in Psalms 28&#151;30.</P>
