   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD INCARNATED TO BE OUR REDEEMER AND OUR LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 16, 17, 29; 3:14-15; 12:24; 1:12-13 THE TWO MINISTRIES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament reveals to us that Christ has taken two major steps.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first was His incarnation, which opened the way for Him to fulfill His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He finished His earthly ministry when He accomplished redemption on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second step was His resurrection and ascension, at which time He began His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By these two ministries, His earthy and His heavenly, Christ has accomplished His divine commission.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To see His earthly ministry is simple, but His heavenly ministry is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nonetheless, without it Christ cannot fulfill God's eternal purpose, which is to have the church as Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The accomplishment of redemption brought fallen mankind back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once this earthly ministry was completed, however, Christ still needed to build up His Body and produce the church in order for God's purpose to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This heavenly ministry, which is far greater and more significant than His earthly, is unfolded to us in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE COMPLETING MINISTRY OF PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Colossians 1:25 Paul tells us that his ministry was to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the New Testament lacked the fourteen Epistles of Paul, the divine revelation would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From his writings, and only in his writings, do we learn:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He must be our life, and we must be His living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2 Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the embodiment and mystery of God, the reality of every positive thing, our life, and the constituent of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 Christ is the Head and the church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No other books in the Bible tell us that the church is the Body of Christ; that this Body is the center of God's eternal purpose; and that God's purpose is not only to redeem His fallen people but also to regenerate them and make them the Body of Christ to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This revelation granted to Paul brought to completion the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE NEED FOR A MENDING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the time of Paul, whose writings were finished about A.D. 66, differing teachings crept in to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the quarter century after the death of Paul, Satan insidiously brought in false teachings regarding both the Person of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Heresies came in, claiming that Christ was not God, was not the Son of God, and even that He did not come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To counter these heresies, the Apostle John around A.D. 90 began writing his books.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One was a Gospel, three were Epistles, and the last was Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we study these writings, we shall see that John was mending what was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul completed the revelation in the Bible, but before too long it was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, after the completing ministry, there needed to be a mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With these two ministries the Bible is concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Notice that with John's writings the Gospels are concluded; the Gospel of John was the last to be written.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then his three Epistles are the conclusion of the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally his Revelation brings to an end the New Testament and even the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the ministries of Paul and John then, the Bible has no conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their main goal, furthermore, is to reveal Christ's heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In their writings we can see what Christ is now doing in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, they sometimes refer to Christ's earthly ministry, but primarily they are concerned with the carrying out of His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If my jacket gets torn, it needs to be mended.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The part that is repaired will be even stronger than the original fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So it was with the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul wrote strongly of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John, however, was even stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He described the churches as lampstands which would eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How much stronger is the city than the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With this message we shall begin a series on the mending ministry of John.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our first book will be the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John's Gospel, though it has twenty-one chapters, has only two main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Chapters one through twelve form one section; chapter thirteen stands in the middle, belonging to neither the first nor the second section; and then chapters fourteen through twenty-one comprise the second section.</S>
