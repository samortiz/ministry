   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here, it would be well if we remember God's way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's goal is to deliver us, through the new life which He gives to us at the time of our regeneration, from 1 sin, 2 natural things our nature , and 3 supernatural things the sinful aspects .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All three steps of deliverance are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a believer limits God's way of salvation and is satisfied only with victory over sin, he is short of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The natural good nature must be overcome, and the supernatural enemy must also be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is good to overcome sin, but unless one overcomes the natural narrowness and the supernatural evil, he is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such victory can only come from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By God's grace I hope to pay more attention to these points, so that the readers will understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Except the section in Volume Three which deals with the body, this book can be considered biblical psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the things we cover are based on the Scripture and confirmed by our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The result of our study is that with every spiritual experience, such as regeneration, there are specific changes within our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After we have studied this subject, we have found that the Bible divides a man into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later on, we will consider the function of these three parts, in particular, the functions of the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will also see what each part includes and how they are different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A few special words are needed for Section One in Volume One.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Knowledge of the distinction between the spirit and the soul and the different functions of the spirit and the soul is indispensable to spiritually-seeking believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only after one knows what the spirit is and what it is to be spiritual can he walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today this teaching is very much lacking in China, and that is why we cover the subject in detail in Section One.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those believers with a good amount of knowledge will not find it hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But those who are not familiar with this kind of distinction should just remember the conclusion for now, and should go on to read Section Two.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first section is not on the spiritual life but on the prerequisite knowledge for the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One will understand more if he finishes the whole book first and then comes back to read that section.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There also needs to be a word of explanation concerning the translation of the Scripture in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I thank God that He has given us a very good translation, the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In many passages, it is even better than some of the English versions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, in many places, due to Chinese grammar and usage, the translation is bound to vary from the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is obviously a shortage when it comes to the study of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever such places occur, I have to furnish my own translation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not concerned with the bluntness of the style; our aim is only to convey the spiritual meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teaching of the difference between the soul and the spirit did not originate with me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Andrew Murray said that the one thing the church, as well as individuals, has to dread the most is the inordinate activity of the soulish will and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>F.B. Meyer also said that unless one knows how to differentiate between the soul and the spirit, he cannot imagine what his spiritual life would have been.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others such as Otto Stockmayer, Jessie Penn-Lewis, Evan Roberts, and Madame Guyon have given similar testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have received the same commission as they, I have freely quoted their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because there are so many places where I have referenced them, I have not made specific reference to the sources.</S>
