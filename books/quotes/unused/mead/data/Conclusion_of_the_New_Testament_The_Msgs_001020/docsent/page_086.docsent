   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God the Father is sovereign and He arranges everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knows what we need.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not yet fully in the image of the firstborn Son of God, but God the Father is causing all things to work together for good so that His purpose of having many sons conformed to the image of the firstborn Son may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's intention is to bring us into full sonship, so we need to grow.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here is the need of God's sovereignty to arrange our environment that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Answering our prayers involves a lot of doings in God's work for our good.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This promise indicates that God is working to crush our enemy Satan under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Though this is something negative, it is still an item of God's work for us in His new dispensation for the accomplishment of His eternal plan that He may have a complete manifestation for His eternal expression.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This building work of God began in perfecting the Old Testament saints, beginning with the patriarchs in the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It continues more intensively in producing the matured believers in the new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually the entire Bible is a full record of God's work in building the New Jerusalem as His complete manifestation for His full expression in eternity, throughout all the dispensations in the old creation: the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the perfected saints of the Old Testament and all the matured believers of the New Testament.</S>
