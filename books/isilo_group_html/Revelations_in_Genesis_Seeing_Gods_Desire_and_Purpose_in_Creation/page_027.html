<p>According to Genesis 2:21-24, the process through which God built Eve is the same process through which Christ produced the church. Just as God produced Eve out of Adam, He produced the church out of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Becoming a Man&mdash;Adam Created</h2>
<p>The first step that God took to gain a counterpart was to become a man. Adam typifies Christ. Romans 5:14 speaks of Adam being a &ldquo;type of Him who was to come.&rdquo; Adam typifies God coming to be a man, that is, God becoming a man. In order to release His life into man, God needed to become flesh, to become a man. Without becoming flesh, God would not have been able to release His life, and man would not have been able to receive His life. As a man, Adam typifies God becoming a man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Passing through Death&mdash;Adam Sleeping</h2>
<p>The second step that God took to gain a counterpart was to pass through death. When Adam could not find a counterpart among the creatures, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him (Gen. 2:21). <em>Sleep</em> here signifies death; hence, the sleep of Adam signifies the death of Christ. Christ is God becoming flesh, becoming a man. In order to release His life, He had to pass through death. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus spoke of Himself as a grain of wheat. He said that unless He fell into the ground and died, the life within Him would not be released, but that if He fell into the ground and died, He would bear much fruit.</p>
<p>In order to produce Eve as a counterpart for Adam, who would be the same as Adam, something had to come out of him. This is the reason that Adam had to sleep. While Adam slept, God took a rib out of his side in order to produce Eve. Just as Adam had to sleep, Christ had to die.</p>
<p>The death of Christ typified by the sleep of Adam is not related to His redemption for our sins. Adam&rsquo;s side was not cut in order to &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; Eve but, rather, to release his life in order to produce her. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s death, which included redemption for our sins, also involved the dispensing of life. Adam&rsquo;s sleep symbolizes the life-imparting death of Christ that Jesus spoke of in relation to a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to bear much fruit. Through death the divine life contained in Christ, as the one grain of wheat, was released.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 only a rib was taken out of Adam while he slept. There is no mention of blood coming out. However, when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood came out in addition to water (John 19:34). The water that flowed out was for the dispensing of life, whereas the blood that flowed out was for the redemption from sins. In Genesis 2 we do not see the aspect of the redemption from sins, because at that time sin had not yet entered into man. It is not until chapter 3 that sin entered into man. Hence, in chapter 2 we do not see the type related to the redemption from sins but to the dispensing of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Flowing Out Life&mdash;Adam&rsquo;s Rib Being Taken Out</h2>
<p>When a deep sleep fell upon Adam, God opened his side and took a rib out of him. This signifies the piercing of Christ&rsquo;s side on the cross and the flowing out of water in His death (John 19:34). The water that flowed out signifies life. This is like the picture in the Old Testament of Moses smiting the rock and the living water flowing out (Exo. 17:1-6). First Corinthians 10:4 says that the children of Israel &ldquo;all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He told people, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37). He also said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (4:14). If we put these verses together, we will realize that on the cross the water that flowed out from the Lord Jesus&rsquo; pierced side signifies His divine life, which is typified by the rib in Genesis 2.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, not one of His bones was broken, whereas the bones of the two robbers who were crucified with Him were broken (John 19:32-33, 36). This signifies that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life was not harmed by death while He was passing through death. The Lord flowed out His life on the cross, and with His life He produced the church. This shows that the third step in God&rsquo;s fulfillment of His purpose is to flow out the divine life from within Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Resurrected&mdash;Adam Being Awakened</h2>
<p>The fourth step is related to Adam being awakened, which symbolizes Christ&rsquo;s being resurrected.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
