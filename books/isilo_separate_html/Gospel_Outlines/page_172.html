<h1 class="title">THE SURPASSING SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Eph. 2:4-8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The source of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The source of salvation is God.</li>
	<li>The source of salvation is God&rsquo;s mercy.</li>
	<li>The source of salvation is God&rsquo;s great love.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The accomplishment of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Salvation is accomplished through the death and resurrection of Christ.</li>
	<li>Salvation is also accomplished through the ascension of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The surpassing salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we were dead in sin, God&rsquo;s surpassing salvation caused us to become alive together with Christ.</li>
	<li>He also caused us to be raised together with Christ. There is a difference between being made alive and being raised. To be made alive means to have life; to be raised means not only to have life but to be able to move. Not only was Lazarus enlivened in the tomb, but his coming out of the tomb shows that he was resurrected, that he was raised up.</li>
	<li>Thirdly, He caused us to sit together with Him in heavenly places. This is surpassing! This is God&rsquo;s surpassing salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The manifestation of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This salvation manifests the rich and abundant grace of God.</li>
	<li>This grace is given to us in God&rsquo;s kindness.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Emphasize that grace is God&rsquo;s action in freely saving us.</em></li>
		<li><em>Emphasize that kindness issues out of God&rsquo;s mercy and love, out of the intent of His heart.</em></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive this salvation<br />
