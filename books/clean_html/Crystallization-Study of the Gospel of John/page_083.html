<P>Question:John 4:14b mentions the fountain and the springing up, but where is the river, signifying the Spirit?</P><P>Answer:The springing up is the spring flowing. The river is implied in the flowing. Into here means issuing in, or to be, to become. The New Jerusalem will be there through the Triune God's flowing. In the beginning of the Bible, God was there. At the end of the Bible is the New Jerusalem. In the beginning, in eternity past, was the Word, who was God. In eternity future the Word becomes the New Jerusalem. This means that in the beginning was God, and at the end He becomes the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is the issue of God's flowing in three stages: in the Father's stage, in the Son's stage, and in the Spirit's stage. All three stages are in us. We have the fountain, the spring, and the river within us at the same time. The fountain emerges, the spring gushes, and the gushing is the flowing as a river into the New Jerusalem.</P><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "We were all baptized into one body." This does not mean the Body is apart from us and that we have been put into the Body. It means we have been baptized into the Body. The baptism of the Spirit put us all together to be the Body. Into means "to be." We have been baptized to be the Body. Eventually, we will be the New Jerusalem, which is God mingled, blended, and incorporated with man. Now we can see that one half of a verse, John 4:14b, covers the entire Bible.</P>
