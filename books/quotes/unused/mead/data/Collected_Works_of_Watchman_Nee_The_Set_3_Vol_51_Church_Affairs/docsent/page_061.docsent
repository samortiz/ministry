   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LOCAL CHURCH, THE WORK,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the relationship between the local church and the work?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the relationship between the local church and the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want to pay special attention to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Local churches such as those in Jerusalem and Antioch are special and exceptional because, on the one hand, they are local churches, and on the other hand, they are centers for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As local churches they are the same as other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As to the work they are also centers for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we have to recognize that Jerusalem and Antioch are somewhat different from other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, regarding other local churches, what is their relationship with the work?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In The Normal Christian Church Life we made quite an effort to show the brothers and sisters that the local church is the highest authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has not established a federated church, a mother church, or a head church above the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no such concept in the Bible as a mother church or a head church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible only a local church is recognized as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, the local church is recognized in the Bible as the unique unit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no authority above her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ELDERS BEING THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a local church the highest authority is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the matters are handled by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles cannot directly interfere with a local church; they cannot deal with the affairs of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, there was a person in Corinth who needed to be removed, and yet Paul could not remove him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very crucial example.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you see from this the relationship between the local church and the work, as well as the relationship between the local church and the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, what the apostles want to do must go through the elders; the things which the apostles want to do cannot be done directly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has not asked a local church to receive the commands of the apostles directly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God only asks the brothers and sisters in a local church to receive the commands of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the spiritual condition of an elder is right, he should receive the commands of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the spiritual side the elders should listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Elders Being Appointed by the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to pay special attention to the point that the apostles appoint the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elders in all the localities are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Timothy and Titus were apostles; they were sent by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two, one in Ephesus and one in Crete, traveled in the surrounding areas and appointed elders in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the authority of the elders is not received from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must make the churches in the various localities see that not one local overseer is elected locally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My father is my father not because I voted for him, but because I was born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders are not chosen by the brothers in the church but are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A local church should not select elders; it has neither the authority nor the knowledge to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The local brothers are absolutely not allowed to select some to oversee them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What God has shown us is that it was Paul, Timothy, and Titus who appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The elders are appointed by the workers from without.</S>
