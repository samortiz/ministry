<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of nine messages given by Brother Witness Lee concerning church service. The dates of the messages contained in chapters 1, 2, and 9 are unknown. The messages contained in chapters 3 through 8 were given during a conference held in February 1952 in Taipei for all the churches in Taiwan. These messages were originally published in issues of <em>The Ministry of the Word,</em> printed in 1951 through 1952.</p>
