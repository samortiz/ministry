   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The One Ministry of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the prominent apostles like Peter, John, Paul, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since last year my view has been much clearer than it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly I had an unconscious understanding that Peter s ministry was not the same as Paul s. However, while working on the Life-study of Peter, and in these recent days on the notes for John s Epistles, I have found out that these three great writers of the New Testament were all carrying out the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now that we have had the training on the Epistles of Peter, I think we can all see that though the terminology and presentation are different from Paul s, the ministry, or the focus of the ministry, is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, they were all doing one work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was not doing one work to carry out one objective and Peter another work to carry out a different objective and John a third work with a third objective.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, they were all doing one work to carry out one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is division?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is a denomination?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the doing of another work, the carrying out of something else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not to say that Paul s preaching and teaching have the same terminology and presentation as Peter s. Nor does John have to preach and teach in the same way as Paul or Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of them used different terminology and different ways of presentation, yet they were all doing the one work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were all participating in the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Case of Selectiveness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Years ago in New York the claim was made that they accepted all ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the end of 1969 when I was invited there, I went to that brother s home and faced him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I told him, You don t accept all ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At least, you don t accept my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, We accept all ministries selectively.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I said, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you accept all ministries selectively, that means you select, doesn t it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as you select, you don t accept all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE RECOVERY AND THE UNIQUENESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There have no doubt been some great preachers and teachers raised up in today s Christianity, but they are for the most part in different ministries because they are working for different denominations, for different works.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord s recovery, however, we are doing one work, carrying out one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are serving one Lord, worshipping one God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are in His unique plan, in His unique economy, in His unique work, in His unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We minister His unique focus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we participate in this unique ministry, we fully realize that each one of us has an individual service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only the so-called gifted ones, even all the saints have each his own service, like the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Levite had his own service, yet the ministry to care for the ark was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was no ministry other than that one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the services of the different Levites were just for the unique ministry of caring for the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To me the picture is more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From past experience we realize that there is a peril that some of the brothers gradually, even unconsciously, may get into a work that is different from the ministry s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not easy to stay in the unique focus, that is, in the focus of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not easy to stay in the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nonetheless, the entire New Testament presents us this unique ministry to minister the Trinity as the unique focus and to produce the church as the unique circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I met Brother Nee, I realized that his work was in the same ministry as Paul s. Because of this, from the day that I met him I did everything as part of the one work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the early days in China many among us didn t know this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All they saw was how one I was with Brother Nee in the work; they didn t realize the principle I took.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we published the first issue of The Stream, the first message was on the one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I pointed out there this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was one with Brother Nee because I saw that in the entire New Testament there is only one flow on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say one city, one church is right, yet this alone is not adequate to keep us in the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Ephesian line would also set up one church, one city, but that is another line.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our ministry is to carry out the divine Trinity, as all the apostles did.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the Epistles reveal this focus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Prophecies and the interpretations of the Old Testament are covered, but all these prophecies and interpretations are for the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Testament doesn t have prophecies apart from the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It does not interpret the Old Testament apart from the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The prophecies are defined, the Old Testament is interpreted, all in the way to carry out the focus, which is the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever we preach or teach in the Lord s recovery must be focused on the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, what we preach and teach will unconsciously produce another work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then such preaching and teaching will become a separate ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only one thing can preserve our preaching and teaching in the one ministry: the unique focus.</S>
