 <h2 class="head1">V. 2 SAMUEL</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: The writers were Nathan and Gad. It was written in Canaan about events that took place between 1056 B.C. and 1018 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ the King defeated God&rsquo;s enemies for the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>C. The background: This book is mainly about King David. The latter part of 1 Samuel recorded David&rsquo;s anointing, suffering, and fleeing in the early days. Second Samuel records David&rsquo;s kingship. The enemies of Israel continued to fight against Israel. The desire of God to have a temple for His habitation had still not been fulfilled. The Israelites had their land, yet they were not at rest, and God did not have His dwelling place. David was raised up for the purpose of conquering their enemies and building up the temple of God.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: As God&rsquo;s people, we should be after God&rsquo;s heart to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy and build up His temple, the church. God is righteous to judge rebellion and sins and to forgive us when we repent.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: After the death of Saul and his son Jonathan, David was inaugurated to be the king of Judah. Later, he was inaugurated king of the whole nation of Israel. He established the capital in Jerusalem. He won many battles and brought back the ark of God. He had a desire to build the house of the Lord. But then David sinned. He caused Uriah to be killed and took his wife Bathsheba. God judged him with: the death of the child of adultery, the killing of Ammon by Absalom, the rebellion of Absalom, and the rebellion of Sheba. David sinned again by numbering the people. God&rsquo;s judgment came as a pestilence that killed seventy thousand men. God forgave David after his repentance. Out of David&rsquo;s two sins came two issues of importance: he had a son called Solomon who would be the builder of the temple, and he obtained a piece of land to be used as the site of the temple.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) David&rsquo;s success (chs. 1&mdash;10), 2) David&rsquo;s failure (chs. 11&mdash;20), and 3) appendix (chs. 21&mdash;24).</p>
 <h2 class="head1">VI. 1 KINGS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The books of 1 and 2 Kings were one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. They were divided by the Septuagint. It is hard for Bible scholars to ascertain who was the author of Kings, but some think that Jeremiah was the author.] This book was probably written in Canaan, recording events that occurred between 1015 B.C. and 897 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ the King strengthened the kingdom of God and built up the temple of God, the church.</p>
<p>C. The background: After King David had established the kingdom, prepared material for the temple, and obtained the site for the temple, God did not have him build the temple directly, because he had killed too many people in all his battles. God raised up his son Solomon to build the temple.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The resurrected Christ will build the church as Solomon built the temple. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, we will build the church with Christ. When God&rsquo;s people feared Him, the kingdom prospered. When God&rsquo;s people departed from Him, the kingdom declined. We should all walk and act &ldquo;as our father David did walk.&rdquo; David loved the temple; we should love the church.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book records the latter years of David&rsquo;s life, the inauguration of Solomon, the building of the temple, the latter years of Solomon&rsquo;s life and his degradation, the division of the kingdom into Judah and Israel, the kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Jehoram, the kings of Israel from Jeroboam to Ahaziah, and the acts of Elijah.</p>
<p>The main event in this book is Solomon&rsquo;s building up of the temple and God&rsquo;s glory filling it. This was the peak of the experience of the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the strengthening of the kingdom (chs. 1&mdash;2), 2) the glory of the kingdom (chs. 3&mdash;10), 3) the division of the kingdom (chs. 11&mdash;12:24), and 4) the decline of the kingdom (12:25&mdash;22).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. 2 KINGS</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: Jeremiah wrote this book. It was probably written in Canaan. The events recorded in this book took place between 896 B.C. and 588 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The decline and the destruction of the divided kingdoms because of rebellion and idolatry.</p>
<p>C. The background: Because of rebellion, idolatry, and division, the kingdom had declined. Most of the kings did evil in the sight of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord warned them of the destruction that would come if they did not repent.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: When God saw that His people rebelled against Him and turned away from Him to serve the idols, He sent His prophet to warn them. He hoped that they would repent and come back to Him. Therefore, the prophets said, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; If they would not listen, His righteous anger would be kindled against them. He would let their enemies overthrow their kingdoms and carry them away into captivity.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book is the record of the kings of the kingdom of Judah and Israel. It also includes the acts of Elisha. It records the history of the kingdom of Judah from Ahaziah to Zedekiah and the kingdom of Israel from Joram to Hoshea.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the latter part of Elijah&rsquo;s ministry (1:1&mdash;2:12), 2) Elisha&rsquo;s ministry (verses within 2:13&mdash;13:25), 3) the decline and the destruction of the kingdom of Israel (verses within 1:17&mdash;17:41), and 4) the decline and the destruction of the kingdom of Judah (verses within 8:16&mdash;25).</p>
