   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Intent in His Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being to Lead Many Sons into Glory</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's intent in His salvation is to lead many sons into glory Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is leading us onward into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not leading us into a heavenly mansion or into any kind of blessing for eternity in the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is leading His many sons into the eternal glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. The Glorification of God's Conformed Sons</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being the Redemption of Their Body</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The glorification of God's conformed sons is the redemption of their body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we can be glorified by God, we must already be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son v. 29 . We cannot be infants, children, or even middle-aged; we must be mature sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A mature son of God is one who has been conformed in his maturity of life to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, Jesus Christ as the firstborn Son of God expresses the divine attributes, and on the other hand, He expresses the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the four Gospels, Jesus was a pattern, a model, of a person who expressed God's attributes in His divinity and the human virtues in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a man, He expressed divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His divinity, He expressed the attributes of God, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His humanity, He expressed the human virtues, such as meekness, forbearance, and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In His divinity, He was very lofty and high, but in His humanity, He was a lowly person who lived a lowly life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the four Gospels we can see Jesus as a person who displayed God's attributes and the human virtues, but in a poor sinner we can see nothing of God or of the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of the virtues of humanity, we can see all the sinfulness of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After being saved, most Christians do not understand that God's intention is that they express God not only in the human virtues but also in His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, they seek only to improve their character and conduct in their human living, not realizing that this kind of seeking is contrary to God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Christian should be a God-man with two natures, humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, we are human; then we are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are divine because we have been born of God John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have received the divine life with the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , and the divine essence has entered into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not merely sons born of Adam; we are also sons born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have had two births, a human birth and a divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we are God-men, exactly like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, we should live a high human life with all the human virtues, such as meekness, humility, and forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, we should express divinity in all the divine attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to realize that glorification will take place on the conformed sons of God, that is, on the mature sons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we cannot be glorified because we are not yet mature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in the process of becoming mature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are fully mature, glorification will come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Glorification may be likened to the blossoming of flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a flower such as a rose blossoms, that is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A rose cannot blossom unless it has a bud.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If there were simply a stump with leaves and branches, the process of blossoming could not take place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when a bud appears, it grows and grows until it reaches maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time it blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blossoming of the bud is its glorification.</S>
