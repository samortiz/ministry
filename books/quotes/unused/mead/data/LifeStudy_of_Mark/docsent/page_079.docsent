   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Applying the Revelation concerning Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as Our Replacement</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mark 9:14-50 is actually a practicing of the revelation of Christ as our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It had been revealed to the disciples that Christ is the entire replacement through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Death terminates us, and resurrection brings Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result is no longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But how can this revelation be applied?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the case of the casting of the dumb spirit out of the man s son, this vision is applied by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As human beings, we all have a problem with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we may use the matter of temper, especially in married life, as an illustration of the fact that certain demons can be cast out only through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In married life it is easy for a husband or wife to have a problem with temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely every husband has a problem with his temper, and every wife has trouble with her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Temper is a serious problem in married life and is a cause of separation and divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a husband and wife never exchange words and are never troubled by their temper, most problems in married life would be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But temper is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we certainly need Christ in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would say in no aspect of our human living do we need Him more than in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you know how to have the best married life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way is to practice not I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how can we practice this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to practice is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, you should not try to subdue your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you try in yourself to subdue your temper, you will eventually have a more serious problem with it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you strive to subdue your temper, the more you will make a deposit in the temper bank.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sooner or later, you will lose your temper in a more serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to try to cast out the demon of temper by your self-effort instead of by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of trying to subdue your temper, you should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you ask the Lord why you are not able to cast out the demon of your temper, He may say, This kind cannot be cast out except by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Calling On the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, we do not need to pray in a lengthy way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is sufficient simply to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even such a short prayer indicates no longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your prayer testifies that you do not exercise your self-effort to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, you apply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to practice the vision concerning Christ with His death and resurrection being our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should not try to cast out demons by your self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to cast out demons, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have pointed out, prayer means no longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the case in 9:14-29 points out that if we would be replaced by Christ, we need to pray instead of trying in ourselves to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE SECOND UNVEILING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OF THE LORD S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 9:30-32 the Lord Jesus unveils His death and resurrection the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 31 says, For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He is killed, after three days, He will rise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, as verse 32 says, the disciples did not understand what He was saying, and they were afraid to question Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Literally, the phrase what He was saying is the word Gk., rhema .</S>
