<P>Many of you young brothers and sisters love the Lord, but be assured that the way you are taking is the way of suffering. Since you love the Lord so much, you are on the way of sufferings all the time. Praise the Lord for the enjoyment of Christ that comes through the sufferings. Without the sufferings, it is hard to have the rich enjoyment of Christ. You can have only a superficial enjoyment. The deep enjoyment of Christ comes through suffering. I cannot tell you what kind of sufferings you will have, but the Lord knows. Step by step and year after year, He knows what you need. He knows what kind of suffering is needed to form a ministry in you.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 6:8 Paul said that he commended himself as a minister of God not only through a good report but also through an evil report. The good report comes from the believers and those who receive the truth preached and taught by the apostles. The evil report comes from the opposers and persecutors. With the apostle Paul there were the evil reports, and if we are following the Lord in an absolute way, our experience will be the same. The evil reports are a real suffering. Paul said that his commendation was "through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true" (v. 8). Glory is from God and those who love Him; dishonor is from the devil and those who follow him. Paul was a deceiver in the eyes of the Judaizers and the people of other religions and philosophies, but true in the eyes of those who loved the truth of God.</P><P>In verse 9 Paul said, "As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death." The apostles were unknown in the sense of not displaying themselves, but well known in the sense of witnessing to the truth of God. It is the same with us today. On the one hand, the apostles were dying in suffering persecutions, but on the other hand, they were living in the Lord's resurrection. Furthermore, they were being disciplined in the opposers' superficial realization. No doubt, the opposers said that Paul must have done something wrong toward God, so God was chastening him. But actually Paul was living in the sovereign care of the Lord.</P><P>During the Second World War, I was imprisoned in China by the invading Japanese army, and during that time I experienced the Lord in a special and rich way. Since you are in the hand of the Lord, you have to be prepared for sufferings. These sufferings produce the ministry. In the early part of my ministry, when I heard the evil reports and the false accusations, I was unhappy. But today when I hear these things, I am happy. Today I can thank the Lord for my imprisonment and for all the opposition and evil reports.</P><P>In verse 10 Paul said, "As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things." This describes the way of the Lord's servants, the way of those who love the Lord's way. It is through this way of suffering that a ministry will be produced with you so that you can really minister Christ to others as life. Second Corinthians 11 shows us that a minister of Christ is always passing through sufferings. We should not expect that we will not have any sufferings. This is wrong. Never be surprised when some suffering comes to you. You have to be ready. Suffering brings you the blessing, and produces a ministry for you.</P><P>Paul spoke of the sufferings in his surroundings, his circumstances, and his environment. Then when he came to chapter twelve he spoke of a thorn in his flesh, which refers to a very subjective, physical suffering in his body. In 2 Corinthians we do not see healings. Instead, we see a thorn. Paul entreated the Lord three times to remove this thorn. This was not an ordinary prayer. The Lord answered by saying that He would not take away this thorn. He would leave the thorn with Paul so that Paul could experience how sufficient the Lord's grace is and how perfect His power is in our weakness (vv. 7-9).</P><P>The apostle Paul was used by the Lord to heal others, but he could not get his physical problem healed. The Lord denied his request and told him that He would leave the thorn with him so that he might experience the Lord's sufficient grace and realize His perfect power. It was through these kinds of sufferings that Paul could have such a wonderful ministry. Paul did not consider himself to be a preacher or an expositor but a minister of Christ, dispensing Christ as life to others. The ministry is produced through sufferings and even kept through sufferings.</P>
