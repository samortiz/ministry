<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains six messages given by Brother Witness Lee. The time and place that the messages were given are unknown. The messages were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine in 1962.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TWO ASPECTS OF PRAYER<br />
BEING FELLOWSHIP AND INQUIRING</h1>
<p>A person who is used by the Lord must be a person of prayer. The apostles said that they would &ldquo;continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). To carry out the ministry of the word is to work for the Lord and to be used by Him. Prayer enables a person to work for the Lord and to be used by Him. The apostles could be used by the Lord because they continued steadfastly in prayer. A person who neglects prayer cannot be used by the Lord. In terms of function, the two aspects of prayer are fellowship and inquiring.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER FOR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Filled with God<br />
and Letting God Flow out of Us</h2>
<p>The first function of prayer is to use our spirit to fellowship with God, that is, to contact and absorb God with our spirit. Our fellowship with God gives Him the opportunity to reveal Himself in us and to transfuse Himself into us so that our mind, emotion, and will are gradually mingled with Him. In this way, God can reveal His intention to us so that we may understand His will. Furthermore, while God operates within us, He exposes and deals with our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. Hence, the first aspect of prayer is to fellowship with God by contacting Him and by letting Him mingle with us and clear up our problems.</p>
<p>When we enter into God&rsquo;s presence, we must consider fellowshipping with Him to be of primary importance. We should not begin with petitioning. Rather, we should first turn to our spirit, behold the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s face, and wait for His operating, enlightening, revealing, anointing, infusing, mingling, filling, and saturating. We should also let the Lord expose our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. If we are willing to thoroughly confess these problems, our conscience will be at peace and without condemnation, and our spirit will be filled with His presence. At this time, we can mention to the Lord the things that we want to pray for.</p>
<p>In the past we have said that we should continually fellowship with the Lord in spirit, but such continual fellowship is often not deep or thorough. Hence, in addition to constant, spontaneous fellowship with the Lord, we must set aside an amount of time in order to focus on turning away from everything other than the Lord and contacting Him in the depths of our spirit. In this time His work in us is often deep and thorough and causes us to prostrate ourselves before Him. As a result, we sense our mistakes, and we are willing to let our mind be broken, our insubordinate will be subdued, and our impure emotion be purified.</p>
<p>Such deep and quiet fellowship enables the Lord to reach every part of our being so that we are subdued, broken, purified, occupied, and possessed by Him. It is during such a time of prayer that the Lord can mingle with us in a deep and thorough way. This is how we pray ourselves into the Lord, absorb Him, fellowship with Him, and are mingled with Him. This is when the Lord touches our mind, emotion, and will, and we are subdued, purified, broken, occupied, and possessed by Him. Furthermore, we are mingled with the Lord, His will is revealed in us, and He can then anoint us with a burden for His work.</p>
<p>The result of our being filled and saturated with God is that the river of water of life can freely flow out of us. Therefore, prayer causes us to be used by God. Prayer causes us to flow out the divine life into others, that is, to impart God into others. This is what it means to be used by God. Every believer who desires to be used by God should learn to pray in such a way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in Fellowship</h2>
<p>The prayer that we are talking about seems to be rather similar to what is ordinarily referred to as the prayer during devotions and retreats; actually, there is a big difference. The believers who promote devotional prayer often do not contact the Lord regularly or live in fellowship with the Lord. They have a set time for spiritual pursuit. This is not what we are referring to. We need to fellowship regularly with the Lord and live in this fellowship. It is not that we fellowship with the Lord only during our time of prayer. We must live in moment-by-moment fellowship with the Lord. However, since we sense that such regular fellowship with the Lord is not deep or thorough, we also set aside time to seek deeper fellowship with Him. If we do not live in constant fellowship with the Lord, our fellowship during a specific time of prayer will not be deep or thorough. If we desire to have thorough fellowship with the Lord during our prayer time, we must live in constant fellowship with Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Contacting God in Spirit</h2>
<p>Devotional prayer emphasizes introspection and petitioning, both of which mainly involve human effort. The prayer we are speaking of is not cultivated by human effort. This type of prayer does not involve introspection or petitions. Rather, it involves going before the Lord in order to contact Him. Instead of examining ourselves, we let the Lord shine on us and expose our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. Instead of petitioning the Lord, we allow Him to operate in us by transfusing and saturating us with Himself and by subduing, breaking, occupying, and gaining us. Such prayer is not a matter of petitioning but of receiving. We receive the Lord&rsquo;s transfusing, shining, and exposing. Furthermore, we allow the Lord to subdue, break, occupy, fill, and saturate us.</p>
<p>Such prayer does not require us to remain silent. We can still speak, but our words should come from the sense within. When we sense that the Lord desires to fill us, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to let You fill my spirit and also my mind, emotion, and will.&rdquo; When we sense that our inward parts are not subdued by the Lord, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, my mind is not completely subdued by You; neither are my emotions and will subdued by You. Lord, subdue any part of my mind that I have reserved for myself, subdue any part of my emotion that has not turned to You, and subdue any part of my will that is independent of You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should spend an hour with the Lord and speak according to the sense in our spirit. There is no need to petition. We only receive. We receive the Lord&rsquo;s transfusing, filling, and occupying. Such prayer involves confessing our sins, prostrating ourselves before the Lord, surrendering, and entrusting ourselves to Him. This is mainly a matter of receiving, not of petitioning. The issue of such prayer is thanksgiving, praise, and worship. We will thank the Lord for His visitation, praise Him for His wonderful work, and worship Him for mingling with us and dwelling in us. This prayer is powerful because we enter into God, and He enters into us. Furthermore, we spontaneously contemplate the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, glory, and virtues. As a result, our spirit is full of worship, and we utter words of praise. While we consider the Lord, our praise should not be hurried or drawn out.</p>
<p>Prayer for fellowship has an element of looking to the Lord. Although we sense that the Lord is mingling with us, we also sense that He is sitting on the throne. Hence, we desire that He would enter our living. Our looking to the Lord is our beholding Him.</p>
<p>Prayer for fellowship also involves waiting. We are not waiting for the Lord to do something; rather, we are waiting on the Lord by remaining in His presence to behold, worship, and praise Him. We should not be too quick to leave His presence but should rather remain in worship. This is like two intimate friends who are reluctant to part from each other. This was Abraham&rsquo;s experience in Genesis. While we wait on the Lord, we often receive further revelation from Him. Because Abraham remained before Jehovah, Jehovah said, &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&rdquo; (18:17). This is the result of waiting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting Aside a Specific Time</h2>
<p>There is no need to hurry, because prayer for fellowship involves many details. The Lord often went up to the mountain to pray (Matt. 14:23; Mark 6:46; Luke 9:28). Sometimes He even spent the whole night in prayer to contact God, to absorb God, and to be filled with God (6:12). Satan always tries to interrupt this kind of prayer. He often sends people, matters, or things from the environment to disturb us while we are praying. Hence, we should leave every disturbance in order to contact God. Those who desire to be used by the Lord must learn this kind of prayer.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of praying in the morning or at night but of turning away from all people, matters, and things in order to contact God in spirit. While we wait on the Lord, we can utter words of praise in order to keep our mind from wandering. Sometimes our mind is not focused even when we worship or praise. We usually need to wait some time before our spirit can enter into God&rsquo;s presence. Then we can have deeper fellowship with God. It is often not possible to have such fellowship in our morning time or evening time with the Lord.</p>
<p>We should spend at least half an hour in order to enter into the spirit. We need between half an hour to an hour for such prayer. If we can spend an hour in prayer, we will learn this lesson. At the very least, we should spend half an hour in prayer. Our lack in the work is mainly because we have not learned this lesson. We must spend time to learn this lesson. Only then can we be truly useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. If we are willing to learn, after half a year we will know the cross, and we will know the meaning of being broken, being subdued, and being spiritual. We cannot rely on our companions in order to learn this lesson. We must learn it ourselves. Without this lesson, we have not received a truly spiritual education. Many spiritual lessons can be learned only through prayer, because all genuine lessons are learned in our fellowship with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER FOR INQUIRING</h2>
<p>The above points are concerning prayer to fellowship with God. This is the foundation of prayer. After a good foundation has been laid, we can enter into the second aspect of prayer&mdash;prayer for inquiring. This aspect of prayer includes inquiring concerning the Lord&rsquo;s work and concerning our personal needs. We will speak concerning inquiring for the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Initiated by God</h2>
<p>The foundation of our prayer is to enter into fellowship with God, that is, to enter into God. Then our prayer is initiated by God, not by us. He gives us the burdens to pray. It is not that we ask God to accomplish something; rather, it is God asking us to petition on His behalf concerning the matter. Matthew 6 shows that genuine prayer is to pray on behalf of God. During the first segment of our prayer, we enter into the presence of God and fellowship with Him. At this time God will anoint us with His burden for the work and reveal His intention to us. We can then petition according to God&rsquo;s will and His burden for the work. These matters are not concerning ourselves but concerning God. Therefore, we are praying on behalf of God, not on behalf of ourselves. This aspect of prayer is initiated by God; it is not initiated by us. Genuine prayer is not for ourselves. Genuine prayer is for God and is initiated by God. When the Lord taught the disciples how to pray, He said, &ldquo;You then pray in this way&rdquo; (v. 9). This is the Lord&rsquo;s initiating and proposing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">More Inquiring Than Petitioning</h2>
<p>The second aspect of prayer should have more inquiring than petitioning. For example, while fellowshipping with the Lord, a responsible brother might sense a concern for the young brothers and sisters. He should then inquire of the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, is this burden from You? What do You want me to do? How do I help them? What is Your purpose with the young brothers and sisters?&rdquo; This is to inquire. We should not begin to petition without first fellowshipping with the Lord. To petition at the beginning of our prayer is to let God know what we want without knowing what He wants. Good prayers are inquiring prayers. When we pray by inquiring, we do not make our desire known to God; instead, God&rsquo;s desire is made known to us. When the responsible brother senses God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the young saints, he should inquire further, &ldquo;Lord, do You want me to fellowship with them?&rdquo; This is the anointing within him. It seems as if it is the brother who is inquiring, but it is God who is working in him. While the brother is inquiring, on the one hand, he will sense a heavy burden within, but on the other hand, he will be filled with life, freedom, and peace. He can also inquire whether he should go by himself or with another brother. Good prayers are inquiring prayers because they honor God.</p>
<p>David knew how to pray. He often inquired of Jehovah (1 Sam. 30:8; 2 Sam. 5:19, 23; Psa. 27:4). The best prayer is to inquire of the Lord step by step, according to the sense within. By inquiring in this way, we can easily receive God&rsquo;s leading, and we can work according to the leading. If we are led to visit a brother, he will surely touch God because God will be expressed through us. Then our going to contact the brother will be God&rsquo;s going to contact him. This kind of work does not have human preference, intention, maneuvering, or capability. Rather, it is full of God mingling with man. Furthermore, our words to the brother will be the issue of fellowship. Before we utter anything, we will first inquire of God; hence, every word will come from our spirit. As a result, every word will touch the spirit of the brother and supply him with God. This is the genuine work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Inquiring before Giving a Message</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to giving a message. Before giving a message, a brother should first enter into fellowship with God and inquire of Him, allowing the Spirit to anoint him and operate within him. Then he should inquire of the Lord, according to the inner sense. As he continues to inquire, his burden will become heavier and his sense will be clearer. Finally, he will be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, if this is what You want me to say, accomplish it according to Your will.&rdquo; This is the best prayer for the Lord&rsquo;s work. The more thorough and detailed the inquiring, the better. A good message comes from inquiring of the Lord. The brother can pray concerning what he has prepared to speak. If he lacks the sense of life and peace, he should wait for a fresh anointing. Genuine prayer is to utter God&rsquo;s desire. Nothing can be more practical than this.</p>
<p>Our work and service should be the issue of inquiring prayer. The extent to which we inquire should be the extent of our work. If we do not have peace, we should not work. Since this kind of work is initiated by God, it will issue in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Thorough</h2>
<p>Our inquiring should be thorough and detailed; that is, all prayers for the work must be thorough. The brothers who give messages should begin with inquiring concerning every point, including the hymns to select, the atmosphere of the meeting, and the audience. It is better to be detailed and thorough when we inquire. If we inquire concerning the hymns, we will have the anointing when we select the hymns. The Spirit will be present in every item of our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fulfilling the Principles of Prayer</h2>
<p>Often our prayers for the work are not answered, because we do not pray according to the principles of prayer. Our prayers need to be according to the principles of prayer. Suppose we visit a brother; we should not ask the Lord to work on the brother. Such prayer does not correspond to the principles of prayer, because it is not initiated by God. In order to correspond to the principles of prayer, we should first use our spirit to contact God and allow Him to anoint His burden into us and to give us the feeling to visit the brother. Then we can inquire based on this feeling. If we sense life and peace within, we can be assured that the visitation is of God. Afterward, we can inquire concerning every aspect of the visit. This is to pray according to the principles of prayer. Then our words will be according to our fellowship with God, and the visit will be effective.</p>
<p>Every time that we pray, we should first enter into fellowship with God in order to receive His feeling. Then, based on this feeling, we should inquire concerning the work. This is the way to be mingled with God and to work in fellowship with Him. This is how we co-work with God and let God work in us through prayer. As a result, God flows out of us. Hence, the work is carried out in fellowship with God and in the spirit of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing Time in Prayer for the Work</h2>
<p>The work cannot be quick, because everything that we do requires fellowship in prayer. Therefore, we need to spend time to pray. The effectiveness of our work depends on how much time we spend before God. If we can learn this lesson, the work will be solid. This lesson requires our whole life to learn. We must learn to pray by fellowshipping and inquiring. The more we learn, the more thorough our prayers will be. The saints who pray in this way will be seeds of life and will bear the fruit of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD<br />
AND BEING USED BY HIM</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USEFUL DEPENDING ON<br />
RESPONDING TO GOD&rsquo;S DEMAND</h2>
<p>A person who desires to be used by the Lord needs the Lord&rsquo;s visitation, and he must be willing to pay the price. Furthermore, he must learn to fellowship with the Lord. Having the Lord&rsquo;s visitation and paying a price are primary matters in being used by the Lord. However, if a person lacks proper fellowship with the Lord, his paying of a price will only be according to knowledge. It will be an action that he takes after learning doctrine. It will not be the result of being touched by the Lord while fellowshipping with Him. We must admit that there are still many things in our heart and in our living that substitute God and usurp His place in us. These things prevent Him from working in us. Unless these things are exposed by God in our fellowship with Him, we will not have any feeling concerning them. When we fellowship with Him, He causes us to realize that certain persons, matters, or objects are occupying us and restricting His work. The experience of being touched by God in our fellowship with Him and surrendering to Him is very precious. This experience will not only enable us to be used by the Lord; it will also keep us fresh and living. When we sense that our experiences, testimonies, or messages are old, there must be a problem in our fellowship with the Lord. We have either lost this fellowship, or we do not fellowship as much. As a result, we do not have new experiences, and we are not useful.</p>
<p>There are two ways of paying the price. One way is to pay the price according to the demand in our feeling. The other way is to pay the price according to the revelation of the truth. We must keep in mind, however, that paying the price according to the revelation of the truth is not enough. We should also be willing to pay the price according to the demand in our feeling that comes through our fellowship with the Lord. Only then will our paying the price be fresh and living. When we lack fellowship and pay the price only according to the revelation of the truth, others will not sense God&rsquo;s presence or His expression. The revelation of the truth may require us to give up a certain matter, but we should pay the price by letting go of it when, in our fellowship with God, we sense that He wants us to let go of it. This way of paying the price is fresh, and it will cause others to sense God.</p>
<p>To be used by God is to let Him flow out of us in order to supply others. However, if we do not let Him flow into us, He cannot flow out of us. The best way to let God flow into us is to fellowship with Him. Every time we fellowship with God, we should sense that He is demanding something of us. If we do not sense that He is demanding something of us, we have not yet entered into His presence. God is always demanding something of us. Fellowship with God is the way to gain Him. It is also the way to pay the price. Those who desire to be used by God must fellowship with Him regularly.</p>
<p>The kind of fellowship we are speaking of does not refer to merely shutting ourselves in a room in order to read the Bible or pray. Fellowship refers to our having contact with God in spirit at any time and in any place. This inward contact with God should continue even while we are busy at work and while we interact with others. When we have such fellowship with God, we can experience and gain Him continually, and He will flow out of us so that we can impart Him into others. When we are such persons, we can be used by God all the time. Those who have a heart to be used by God must learn this lesson.</p>
<p>God always requires something of us when we fellowship with Him. Hence, in every experience of genuine fellowship we do not feel as though we have gained much from God; instead, we feel as though God has asked many things of us. If we always feel that we have gained God but not that He has required anything of us, we cannot be used by Him. Those who are used by the Lord often feel that He is constantly requiring something of them, and they are willing to respond by His grace. As a result, living water is constantly flowing from them, just like a renowned spring in Shantung Province, China, that flows and gushes forth water even when there is a long drought. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (John 7:38).</p>
<p>The Lord always demands something of us in our fellowship with Him because there are too many matters and things in us that replace Him. There are many things that replace Him within us and in our living and in our environment; hence, we do not express much of His element. For this reason, the Lord continually makes demands on us. The more ground we give to the Lord, the more He will require of us. When we answer His demands, He will require more of us. However, if He does not ask anything of us, our fellowship with Him has been interrupted, and although we may still work, we cannot be used by Him. We may labor, but we will not have the flow of life. We may still give messages, but we will not impart God into others. Hence, as those who desire to be used by God, we must not neglect the lesson of fellowshipping with God. We must enter into His presence continually and respond to His demands.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>To fellowship means to be in the presence of God. To live in fellowship with God means to live in His presence. In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; When we abide in the Lord, we are with the Lord, and when the Lord abides in us, He is with us. Here, abiding denotes remaining. The Lord desires that we remain in His presence and not leave it. When we are continually with the Lord and He is continually with us, we are in fellowship with Him. This fellowship is also a union. The Lord explains this in chapter 15. Our union with the Lord is maintained through our fellowship with Him. Once the fellowship is lost, there is no practical union. Hudson Taylor wrote a book concerning his study on Song of Songs, entitled <em>Union and Communion.</em> Song of Songs is concerning our experience of fellowship with the Lord. Our fellowship with the Lord is our communion with Him. Fellowship and union are one matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP INVOLVING<br />
THE SPIRIT AND OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is Spirit (John 4:24). Since God is Spirit, He is not with us in our physical body. He is with us in our spirit, the deepest part of our being. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit is in our regenerated spirit. Hence, we have freedom in our spirit, and we are being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from the Lord Spirit (v. 18).</p>
<p>Our fellowship with God involves two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit. God is Spirit, and the created man has a spirit within him. The human spirit is the highest, the deepest, and the most central part of man. It is also the most genuine part of man. Human beings are higher than all the animals because humans have a spirit. The spirit in man enables him to contact God. The Spirit with our spirit is the meaning of our fellowship with God. It is the way for us to fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING SENSED IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&rdquo; (Rom. 8:6b). According to this verse, we can sense the Spirit with our spirit. Romans 6 is doctrinal, but Romans 8 is experiential. Verse 6 says that the result of setting our mind on the spirit is life and peace. This sense of life and peace must be something that we can experience. The word <em>peace</em> does not refer to peace in our environment. It refers to the peace in our inner being. When we have peace in our spirit, we feel proper, comfortable, at rest, and at ease. Similarly, the life spoken of in this verse must be something that can be sensed. When we have the sense of life in our spirit, we are satisfied, strengthened, watered, refreshed, living, and bright. When we set our mind on our spirit, we sense life and peace within. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; This freedom is also something that we can sense. These two verses show that when the Spirit is with our spirit, we sense life, peace, and freedom. Hence, God is with us whenever we sense life, peace, and freedom within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death&rdquo; (Rom. 8:6a). Death is also something that can be sensed. Death is not only in contrast to life but also in contrast to peace. Hence, the sense of death is opposite to the sense of life and peace, and it includes emptiness, weakness, dryness, staleness, depression, darkness, not being satisfied, not being comfortable, not being at rest, and not being at ease. Whenever we have such feelings within, we must realize that we have touched death. Such feelings also indicate that we are not living in our spirit and have lost our fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP DEPENDING ON<br />
THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Fellowship refers to a continual living in our spirit in communion with the Spirit. Our spirit should remain in fellowship with the Spirit even when we are very busy. We even may laugh or we may become angry as long as we remain in fellowship with the Spirit in our spirit. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;[The eternal life] which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The apostles reported the eternal life to the believers so that the believers might have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. We have this fellowship because we have the eternal life. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; In Philippians 2:1 fellowship is a matter of our spirit: &ldquo;If any fellowship of spirit.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that our fellowship with God is entirely of life and altogether in the spirit. Our fellowship with God depends not on our outward acts but on the fact that the Spirit is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Prior to our salvation the Spirit of God and our spirit were separate. At our salvation the Spirit entered into our spirit, and we were joined to Him. The Spirit and our spirit have become one spirit. Being joined as one spirit is a continuous matter involving a mutual flow. The life of God, which we have received, is neither a part nor the whole but a mutual flow. This mutual flow is the fellowship of the divine life, and it makes us one with God by mingling us with Him. Fellowship is a matter of communion between the Spirit and our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING THE FOUNDATION<br />
FOR OUR GROWTH AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>A genuinely spiritual person remains in his spirit, enjoys God&rsquo;s presence, and has life, peace, and freedom. He is also satisfied and strengthened. Since he lives in fellowship with God, the divine life can flow into him and become his constitution. As a result, he can always express the life of God and impart this life into others. By means of the divine life flowing into him and becoming his constitution, he gradually grows in this life unto maturity. The flow of life and the imparting of life are the genuine work of every person who serves the Lord. Our growth in life and our function in the work depend on the fellowship of life, which is also fellowship in God&rsquo;s presence. It is possible that some of us do not have the fellowship of life, yet we still give messages, pray, visit, or administrate the church. This kind of work, which is not in fellowship with God, is merely a job, and it cannot impart life into others. The inexperienced ones may regard such outward things as being the work of God, but those who are experienced, who live in fellowship with God, know that such work can be carried out without fellowship and without the supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE INNER SENSE FOR FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>A believer who desires to be used by God must pay the price. This is the prerequisite to being used by God. In addition to paying the price, there are still many lessons that can be learned only in fellowship with God. Some brothers paid a price when they began to serve, but now they cannot be properly used by the Lord, because they gradually lost the fellowship. Not every person who pays the price is able to maintain the fellowship. However, those who maintain the fellowship will surely be able to pay the price. When we are not willing to obey the inner sense and pay the price, the fellowship will cease spontaneously. There are times when we pay the price, yet we do not have the fellowship. Learning to fellowship with the Lord is the most important lesson for the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones. Fellowship is the key to all our spiritual experiences, whether they are related to our life, our living, or our work. Hence, if we desire to be used by God, we must pay full attention to this fellowship.</p>
<p>Concerning learning to fellowship, we must begin with knowing the inner sense. Suppose a brother senses that he does not have life, peace, or freedom within. He must stop and immediately check with God concerning the reason. Perhaps he did something that God forbade, or he kept something that God wanted him to give up. Perhaps he has remained in a certain sin and is not willing to forsake it, even though he has a feeling about the situation. As long as he is willing to enter the presence of God, it will be easy for him to find the cause. Once he knows the cause, he must deal with it immediately. If he is not willing to deal with it, his sense of death and bondage will become more acute. These negative feelings are warnings from God, telling the brother that there is a problem and that he should check with God.</p>
<p>It may be that a brother did not make a mistake, commit a sin, or disobey God, but he senses hunger and thirst within. The sense of hunger and thirst differs from the sense of death, unrest, bondage, and emptiness. The sense of emptiness and death is not normal, but the sense of hunger and thirst is normal. God uses the sense of hunger and thirst to urge us to seek Him in prayer and to pay the price to gain Him. If we are willing to take care of this sense within, we will enter deeper into the presence of God. The sense of dullness is different from the sense of darkness. The sense of darkness is abnormal, and it indicates that there is a problem between us and God; that is, we have offended Him. The sense of dullness is often an urging from God for us to rise up and pursue Him in prayer and wait for His calling. When we have the sense of dullness, we should rise up to wait on God and seek Him in a deeper way.</p>
<p>There is also the sense of indifference, in which we neither feel peaceful nor restless. This is also a calling from God for us to enter into His presence. In order to take adequate care of the inner sense, we need to spend time to absorb God in prayer. Prayer is the way to absorb God. If we do not take adequate care of the inner sense, we will lose the sense of life, peace, and freedom. God gives us the inner sense because He desires that we would draw near to Him and respond to His call. If we do not ignore the inner sense, we will enter into deeper fellowship, which will result in our experiencing abundant life and enjoying deeper peace and more freedom. If we ignore the inner sense, we will lose the fellowship of life, which will cause us to lose the sense of life, peace, and freedom.</p>
<p>If we are willing to learn the fine details of the lesson of being in the presence of God and fellowshipping with Him, we will grow in life daily, and we will also be constituted with the spiritual element daily. As a result, we will have the overflow of life and be able to impart the divine life into others. This is the result of living in the divine fellowship and of allowing God to constitute His divine element into us. God can flow out of those who are willing to become such people, and such people can be used by God.</p>
<p>Fellowship is the flow of life. It is the Spirit flowing within us. To learn the lesson of fellowship is to take care of the feeling in our spirit by dealing with ourselves before God. Hence, we must set aside a substantial amount of time in order to look to Him, to absorb Him, and to wait on Him. We must enter into His presence so that He has the opportunity to strengthen the flow of His life within us. The more time we spend entering into His presence to wait on Him, draw near to Him, and absorb Him, the more opportunities He will have to flow in us. The dealings produced through this kind of fellowship will strengthen our fellowship with God, produce the overflow of life, and manifest our function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USEFUL DEPENDING ON TOUCHING LIFE</h2>
<p>As those who desire to be used by the Lord, we should pay attention to the fellowship of the divine life and not to good and evil or to right and wrong. The fellowship of life is the principle of the tree of life. Any church or any saint who desires to be used by the Lord cannot live in the realm of right and wrong. Whatever we touch in the realm of right and wrong is not of life and does not give peace or freedom. We must touch God&rsquo;s presence, that is, His life. When we touch death, our service comes to a halt. The key to being used by the Lord is to touch Him. This applies to an individual saint and to a church. Those who are in communion with God will be used by Him. Rather than arguing over the fine details of the truth, we should pay more attention to entering into a deeper fellowship with the Lord. Regrettably, many saints who have a heart to serve the Lord have fallen into the trap of the devil; that is, they are in the realm of right and wrong or good and evil. As a result, they have lost the flow of life and have fallen into death. When believers debate concerning an item of the truth, they may get clear concerning the truth, but they almost always touch death. We must not forget that only those who touch the flow of life can be used by God. Hence, we must touch the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray was greatly used by God because he was a person who touched the divine fellowship. He brought people into God, and his work was very effective. The secret of being used by the Lord lies in the fellowship of life. We must be willing to forsake other things in order to keep this fellowship. The apostle John was a mender of nets, and his ministry was a mending ministry with the divine life. God used him to write the last book of the Bible, Revelation, in which every spiritual matter concludes with the divine life. The foundation of serving the Lord is the experience of life, and the experience of life depends on our fellowship with the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP AND THE MINGLING<br />
OF GOD WITH MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING TO LET GOD&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
FLOW THROUGH US AND BE MINGLED WITH US</h2>
<p>The proper meaning of being used by God is to be a channel for the life of God to flow into us and then flow out of us. Since we are not lifeless pipes, when the divine life flows through us, it is also mingled with us. Fellowship is to allow God not only to flow through us but also to mingle with us. Some believers teach that a Christian must pursue to arrive at the stage of having nothing of his own life and nature but only having God&rsquo;s life and nature. This teaching seems to be very spiritual, but it is not accurate. Genuine spirituality does not mean that our human life ceases to exist but that God&rsquo;s life is mingled with our human life. It is not that we lose our human nature but that God&rsquo;s nature is mingled with our redeemed humanity.</p>
<p>When Peter wrote his Epistles, he was filled with the life of God. However, it is obvious that Peter did not lose his life, nor was his life replaced by the divine life. Rather, the divine life was mingled with his human life. Although Peter expressed the divine life, this expression had the flavor of his humanity. Similarly, Paul was also full of the divine life, but the divine life expressed through Paul also possessed his human flavor. The early believers were filled with the divine life, but what they expressed was distinct. What they expressed contained the element of their life and nature. This is genuine spirituality.</p>
<p>Genuine spirituality does not mean that the human life is exchanged for the divine life. Genuine spirituality means that God is mingled with man, such that the human life does not exist alone nor does the divine life exist alone. Strictly speaking, our fellowship with God, in which He flows into us and flows out of us, is not merely a matter of His flowing through us but of His mingling with us. In this mingling, God is constituted into us. In this mingling, the human element is not annulled or abolished. The human element continues to exist, but it is mingled with God. As a result of this mingling, man becomes a hybrid, possessing two natures and two lives. On the one hand, it is God who lives, but on the other hand, it is man who lives. Do not think that those who fellowship with God and allow Him to flow through them do not have thoughts, emotions, intentions, preferences, or inclinations. They still possess the function of their mind, emotion, and will, but the element of God is mingled with them. The element of God is mingled in their thoughts, feelings, and decisions. As a result, God is manifested through their mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>To say that a person gives up his human life in exchange for the divine life is an erroneous concept. On the contrary, every person who fellowships with God becomes living and active. His will becomes strong, his emotion becomes fervent, his mind becomes sober, and he becomes living, energetic, and full of activity. Then not only does he afford God an adequate, sound, and living coordination, but he also has continual fellowship with God. Nevertheless, his thoughts, will, preferences, opinions, and inclinations are not independent. His thoughts are dependent on God and are mingled with God&rsquo;s thoughts, and his emotions are also mingled with God&rsquo;s emotions. Everything that he wills and does is the result of God being mingled with him. Therefore, his thinking is God&rsquo;s thinking, and his speaking is God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>According to this view, all the Epistles are God&rsquo;s words. It does not matter whether they were written by Paul, Peter, or John; they are God&rsquo;s words. It is difficult for unbelievers to accept the view that the words written by Paul are God&rsquo;s words. If we understand what it means to fellowship with God, however, we will know why the words of the apostles are God&rsquo;s words. The apostles had such a deep mingling with God that their speaking was His speaking in them, their preferences were His preferences, and their move was His moving within them. This corresponds to Philippians 1:20-21, which says, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body...For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; These verses mean that it is not only Christ living but Christ living in me. This is also what Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh...&rdquo; The first part of this verse says, &ldquo;It is no longer I,&rdquo; but the next part says, &ldquo;I now live.&rdquo; This is genuine spiritual living. It is not that we lose our human element but that our human element is mingled with the divine element; our whole being is filled with God&rsquo;s element. Such a person expresses the flavor of God. When he speaks, others sense that God is speaking. When he gives his view, others sense that it is the mind of God. Even when he is angry, others sense God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of being a water pipe through which God as the living water flows, because there is no relationship between a pipe and the water flowing through it. Genuine spirituality means that the human nature is mingled with the divine nature. God was mingled with Paul. As a result, on the one hand, Paul&rsquo;s Epistles bear Paul&rsquo;s flavor, but on the other hand, they are the words of God. This situation differs from the way that the prophets spoke in the Old Testament. The Old Testament prophets spoke because God&rsquo;s words came to them. Hence, their tone was God&rsquo;s, not theirs. The prophets in the Old Testament often said, &ldquo;Jehovah says,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah.&rdquo; The situation in the New Testament Epistles is completely different. Apart from the seven epistles in Revelation, the Epistles do not bear the tone of the Lord&rsquo;s direct speech. On the contrary, Paul charged the believers (1 Cor. 7:10; 11:17), and Peter entreated them (1 Pet. 2:11; 5:1). The book of Romans is the Word of God and is inspired by the Holy Spirit. However, in this book Paul says, &ldquo;I exhort you...through the compassions of God&rdquo; (12:1), and &ldquo;I say&rdquo; (15:8). In his Epistles, John says, &ldquo;We report also to you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;These things we write&rdquo; (1 John 1:3-4). Even though these were John&rsquo;s words, they were recorded in the New Testament. Even though these words were spoken by the apostles, they are God&rsquo;s words because God was mingled with the apostles. For this reason, when the apostles spoke, God spoke through them. The apostles were God-men. This is spirituality.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP ADDING THE DIVINE ELEMENT<br />
TO THE HUMAN ELEMENT</h2>
<p>When a person is possessed by a demon, the function of his mind, emotion, and will are annulled. When God mingles with a person, He does not annul the human element. God wants man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will to cooperate with Him. Hence, the more spiritual we become, the richer our mind, emotion, and will become. A spiritual person is more human because his human element is enriched with the divine element. Such a person is moved by the Spirit. Furthermore, God flows through such a person and mingles with him. What that person says or does is according to the proper standard of humanity. His personality is not annulled; rather, it is strengthened.</p>
<p>According to his biography, Andrew Murray&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will were enriched, yet he was also firm and resolute. His thoughts touched God&rsquo;s mind, his affection touched God&rsquo;s emotion, and his will touched God&rsquo;s intention. Other spiritual giants were the same. They did not lose their human nature, but they stopped being independent of God. Genuine fellowship does not cause a person to cease to exist. On the contrary, he becomes more active. However, he no longer does things by himself. He depends on God and touches God&rsquo;s feeling in everything he does.</p>
<p>A lethargic person who sleeps all the time is cowardly and cannot be spiritual. A spiritual person must be sober and sound. He will have rich thoughts, fervent emotions, and a strong, resolute will. He will depend on God, and his revelation, insight, and understanding will not be independent of God. He will be subject to God, depend on God, and let God be mingled with him. Hence, the divine element will be in his mind, emotion, and will. For this reason, his speaking, decisions, and wisdom will be God&rsquo;s speaking, decisions, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Two brothers may be intelligent, but one brother can have the flavor of God while the other does not. Two sisters might lose their temper, but one sister expresses God while the other expresses her flesh. An elder might speak a harsh word of rebuke, and yet others sense the flavor of God. We can discern the difference in such cases.</p>
<p>We should not think that when we fellowship with God, our person ceases to exist. If a person ceases to exist, it is likely that he is possessed by a demon. When we learn to fellowship with the Lord, we learn to use our mind, emotion, and will properly and to subject them to God. If a thought causes a sister to feel dry, empty, or restless, she should reject it and think of something else. If another thought gives her light and comfort, she should receive it, because it is of life. If a brother who is ready to give a message feels bothered within, that is God&rsquo;s prohibition. He should seek the Lord until he feels bright and refreshed. This should be our practice even when we select hymns for a meeting.</p>
<p>We do not cease to have thoughts when we fellowship with the Lord. On the contrary, we are full of thoughts. However, we do not depend on our thoughts but on the sense of life in our spirit&mdash;the sense given to us by God. When we subject our thoughts to the sense in our spirit, we are subjecting our mind to God and are being mingled with Him. Our love for others should be according to the sense in our spirit. It is not that we are without emotions. We are full of emotions, but our emotions are subject to the sense in our spirit. This also applies to our will. Our spirit should be the dominant part of our being. If our spirit is subject to God, our whole being will also be subject to God. This is the way to touch the presence of God in our walk. This is to live in fellowship. Then what we say and do will have the divine element, express God, and supply life. As those who desire to be used by God, this is the most basic lesson that we should learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING GOD FLOW THROUGH<br />
EVERY PART OF OUR BEING</h2>
<p>The proper meaning of fellowship is that God flows into man as life in order for man to be mingled with Him. God is Spirit, and we have a human spirit. The Spirit has entered into us in order to be our life. Before man&rsquo;s fall, the human spirit was his dominant organ; it governed and directed him. His mind, emotion, and will, with their various functions, were under the direction of his spirit. The actions of his body were also under the direction of his spirit. Although he was not indwelt by the Spirit, his human spirit was able to communicate with God. Although God was outside of man, He could direct the spirit within man. Hence, man lived before God and was under God&rsquo;s control. From the human viewpoint, this condition seems to be good enough. For this reason, many Christians think that God&rsquo;s salvation is merely to bring us back to man&rsquo;s original condition. It has not occurred to them that God&rsquo;s salvation exceeds bringing man back to his original condition. God&rsquo;s purpose is to be one with us by entering into our spirit, dwelling in our spirit, and being mingled with us. Thus, God desires to direct and govern our entire being. Not only so, He desires to spread from our spirit into every part of our being.</p>
<p>God in His salvation desires not only to rule over us but also to be mingled with us. This mingling begins with our spirit until it reaches every part of our being. God first enters into our spirit to become one spirit with us. Then from our spirit He spreads into our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will. God mingles with our mind, emotion, and will so that our mind expresses His thoughts, our emotion expresses His feelings, and our will expresses His decisions.</p>
<p>To fellowship with God is to let Him operate and work freely in our spirit so that He can reach our mind, emotion, and will. His spreading requires that our mind, emotion, and will be subject to our spirit. God is already mingled with and joined to our spirit as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Hence, when our mind, emotion, and will are subject to our spirit, they are also subject to God. If we allow our spirit to rule over us, that is, to direct our mind, emotion, and will, the Spirit will flow into every part of our being. This flow is fellowship. When we fellowship with God, we let Him flow from our spirit to every part of our being.</p>
<p>When our mind, emotion, and will make a move that is not under the ruling of our spirit, our fellowship with God is broken. When the flow stops, the fellowship is lost. Once we lose the fellowship, we lose God&rsquo;s presence. This is serious. We should be in fear and trembling so that we would not allow our mind, emotion, and will to bypass the ruling of our spirit. The Spirit is able to flow freely within our being when our mind, emotion, and will are subject to the ruling of our spirit. As a result, we will remain in fellowship with God and enjoy His presence, and God will be mingled with us and spread to every part of our inner being. Furthermore, He will flow out of our inner being, and the element of God will be seen in our living and walk. At this time, the divine element will be mingled with our human element.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP ENABLING US TO HAVE<br />
THE DIVINE LIFE AND NATURE</h2>
<p>The Bible says that God is Spirit (John 4:24), and it also refers to the Spirit as God (Acts 5:3-4). The Bible also says that God is life (John 5:26; 11:25; 14:6). God, Spirit, and life are one. Spirit is God&rsquo;s nature, and life is His content. Therefore, it is equally correct to say that God is in us, that the Spirit is in us, and that God&rsquo;s life is in us. To say that God is in us refers to Him as a person. To say that the Spirit is in us means that He is spiritual, not physical. To say that God&rsquo;s life is in us means that the content of the Godhead is in us. Our fellowship is in God, in the Spirit, and in life. Fellowship is the means by which we are mingled with God and become one flow with Him. Fellowship makes us spiritual, and through fellowship we are constituted with the content of God. Through fellowship we are mingled with God, and we gain His nature and His life.</p>
<p>Fellowship is the mutual flow of God and man, in which God and man are mingled as one. This can be compared to adding sugar to water to produce sugar-water. It is erroneous to say that only the water remains when the sugar disappears. Rather, the water is in the sugar, and the sugar is in the water. Likewise, in the mingling of God with man, man is not annulled. Rather, God is mingled with man, and man is mingled with God. The two, God and man, become one.</p>
<p>God is mingled with man through His being the Spirit as well as life. God mingles His nature, which is Spirit, with every part of our being. He also mingles His content, which is life, with every part of our being. Prior to His being mingled with our mind, emotion, and will, we did not possess His nature or His content. Through fellowship He mingles His nature and His life with our mind, emotion, and will. Then the nature of our thoughts becomes spiritual, and their content will be life; the nature of our emotions will be spiritual, and their content will be life; and the nature of our decisions will be spiritual, and their content will be life. Others will sense the flavor of God in our mind, emotion, and will because we are mingled with His spiritual nature and His content of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING INDEPENDENT</h2>
<p>We learn to fellowship by being dependent on God. We do not allow our mind, emotion, or will to be independent of our spirit. When we are not independent from God, we will not be independent from the spirit, and we will not use our mind, emotion, or will apart from our spirit. The thoughts of our mind will be subject to the ruling and supervision of our spirit. Our spirit will examine the feelings of our emotions and the decisions of our will. To exercise in this way is to learn to fellowship with God. Our fellowship with God is broken whenever our mind, emotion, or will is independent from our spirit. Sin is not the only thing that interrupts our fellowship with God. As soon as our mind, emotion, or will is independent from God, we lose the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>The lesson of fellowship involves bringing the activities of our whole being under the constant ruling of our spirit. We should not engage in an activity before it is examined by our spirit. Otherwise, even the best activities, such as giving a message or praying, can cause us to lose the fellowship of the divine life. Anything that is not examined by our spirit is independent of our spirit. The activities that disrupt our fellowship with God also cause our spiritual life to suffer loss. When we learn the lesson of fellowship, our spirit will become strong, healthy, living, and fresh. Furthermore, the Spirit will have the opportunity to spread into our mind, emotion, and will. When our mind is brought under the ruling and examination of our spirit, our spirit becomes strong, and the Spirit will have the opportunity to mingle with our mind. As a result, our mind will have God&rsquo;s spiritual nature and His life. Similarly, if we bring our emotion and will under the ruling of our spirit, our spirit will be strengthened, and the Spirit will spread into our emotion and will so that they become spiritual.</p>
<p>Initially, as we learn to fellowship, we need to bring our mind, emotion, and will under the ruling of our spirit all the time. After a period of time, our inner being will spontaneously turn to our spirit and remain under the ruling of our spirit. At that time, we will not wait until we are about to do something to be under the direction of our spirit; rather, our spirit will rule our mind, emotion, and will, telling them what to do. In the initial stage, we often will act first and be examined by our spirit later. At a later stage, our spirit will take the initiative to direct our mind, emotion, and will. Initially, we must turn to our spirit and inquire of our spirit. Later, we will remain in our spirit, and our spirit will direct us. At this time, our entire being is under the control of our spirit, and our spirit becomes our person. Our spirit will be enthroned in our being and will have the first place; we will be directed by our spirit. Then it will be easy to fellowship and to release our spirit. As a result, the life of God will flow out in our daily living.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Here are nine points to help us practically learn the lesson of fellowshipping with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting a Definite Time</h2>
<p>Because we are weak, we must set a definite time to fellowship with God. First Kings 18:21 says, &ldquo;How long will you go hopping between two opinions?&rdquo; Those who hop between two opinions cannot learn spiritual lessons. We must set a definite time to learn the lesson of fellowship. If we do not learn to enter into fellowship, the messages we have heard will not be useful to us. The Lord&rsquo;s teachings in Matthew 5&mdash;7 cannot be worked out by self-cultivation. They are lived out of a person who is under the rule of the heavens. When we are in fellowship with God, we can obey the heavenly rule, and God is lived out of us. Only in fellowship with God can we receive spiritual light. We must set a definite time to learn the lesson of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Thorough Consecration</h2>
<p>The real meaning of fellowship is to be mingled with God. However, God must obtain our consent before He can do a work of mingling. Hence, it is necessary for us to begin our fellowship with a thorough consecration by handing everything over to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning First to the Spirit</h2>
<p>After our consecration, the activities of our mind, emotion, and will must first be brought under the examination of our spirit; otherwise, we should not do anything. This point is not easy to learn, because we are independent by nature. Since we desire to be mingled with God, after we consecrate ourselves, we should bring every matter first to our spirit, touch the feeling in our spirit, and wait for the command of our spirit. We should do what our spirit permits and not do what our spirit forbids. Whether a matter is great or small, it should be examined by our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Serious and Diligent</h2>
<p>Learning to fellowship is a serious lesson. A careless and casual person will not learn this lesson properly. Therefore, we should seriously and diligently exercise to learn the lesson of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ignoring Any Reasoning</h2>
<p>Reasonings are distractions from Satan. Hence, we should learn to ignore the analysis and reasonings in our mind. When we begin to reason, our fellowship will be interrupted. We should not care for being right or wrong in the details of our practice. We should care only for the principle of turning to our spirit and being directed by our spirit. When we focus on right or wrong, our fellowship is interrupted, and we fall into the trap of reasoning and analyzing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising the Will</h2>
<p>In order to learn the lesson of fellowship, we should not wait passively to be moved by the Spirit. Instead, we need to actively exercise our will. This corresponds to the teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing</h2>
<p>We should learn to have faith and believe that we are in God&rsquo;s hand and under His leading and keeping. Whether or not we are right or wrong, He bears the responsibility for our fellowship. Without believing, we cannot learn to fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up a Habit of Turning to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>In every situation we must be able to exercise our spirit. We must be those who turn toward our spirit, not toward the world. Some believers turn toward their spirit when they pray but turn away from their spirit after finishing their prayer. We must practice turning all the time. We should not wander out of our spirit. It is even best not to try to determine if we are in or out of our spirit. We should simply seek the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living according to the Inner Sense</h2>
<p>We should not do anything if we have not touched the sense in our spirit. This means that we should not have any activity that is apart from the sense in our spirit. We should not be passive, nor should we exercise our will apart from our spirit. The exercise of our will must be under the direction of our spirit. We must build up the habit of turning our entire being to the spirit and doing everything in our spirit. If the Spirit does not move, we should not move. We should always be those who are stirring up our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see how to live in fellowship with God. The goal of redemption is for God to work Himself into man so that the divine nature is mingled as one with the human nature and that the human nature is mingled as one with the divine nature. To be spiritual does not mean that the human nature is annulled and replaced by the divine nature. Rather, to be spiritual is to have the divine nature mingled with the human nature so that the human nature is transformed and uplifted. The human nature that we received from birth was merely created, but with the addition of the uncreated divine life and nature of God, it is transformed.</p>
<p>The first step of God&rsquo;s work is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. When we are saved, we receive the life of God. This life is actually God Himself. Furthermore, God enters into man as the Spirit. Therefore, when God enters into man, the Spirit enters into man, because the Spirit is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That God Is Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to fellowship with God, we must know that God is Spirit (John 4:24). If we do not know that God dwells in us as the Spirit, we cannot fellowship with Him in every place. God is Spirit; hence, we can fellowship with Him at any time and in any place. The Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman that the place to worship the Father was neither in Jerusalem nor in Samaria (v. 21). God is Spirit; He transcends every geographic location. The Spirit can be likened to air. He can be contacted anywhere, and we can fellowship with Him at any time. Just as God is not limited by time or space, our fellowship with Him is not limited by time or space. We can contact the Spirit in any place, at any time, and in any environment. First John 3:24 says, &ldquo;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; God gave us the Spirit so that we could fellowship with Him at any time, in any place, and under any circumstance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit and the Divine Life</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is Spirit, and His content is life. The life of God contains many rich items, such as holiness, love, light, goodness, righteousness, meekness, and humility. As God&rsquo;s nature, the Spirit is omnipresent. As God&rsquo;s content, the divine life is all-inclusive. Not only can we fellowship with God at any time and in any place, but in this fellowship we can contact the content of God, including all His attributes.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the Spirit and life? Does the Spirit include life, or does life include the Spirit? Does the Spirit issue in life, or does life issue in the Spirit? Is the Spirit primary and life secondary, or is life primary and the Spirit secondary? The Spirit includes life, and the Spirit issues in life; hence, the Spirit is primary. The Spirit is a person. When we fellowship with God, we touch the Spirit, the nature of God&rsquo;s person. Furthermore, the Spirit is omnipresent. We contact the Spirit in our fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Depending on Touching Life</h2>
<p>Air is a good analogy of the omnipresence of the Spirit. However, air does not have personality or life. Just as we can breathe air anywhere, we can contact the Spirit anywhere. The Spirit is a divine person. Furthermore, when we touch the Spirit, we touch life, because the Spirit is life. With such a realization, it is easy to fellowship with God. Whenever and wherever we desire to fellowship with God, we need only to contact the Spirit, because God is Spirit. When we touch the Spirit, we touch the divine life, and this life will operate in us. This life will cause us to love others and to be humble, meek, patient, righteous, and forgiving, because these virtues are contained in the divine life.</p>
<p>The more we fellowship with God, the deeper the divine life will operate in us. We cannot determine to love, to be patient, or to be humble. Our love, patience, and humility must be produced by the operation of the divine life in us when we fellowship with God. It is not that we determine to love or to be humble but that He is our love and our humility. Through the operation of the divine life, the divine attributes increase within us. After fellowshipping with God just once in the morning, a brother will not have perfect love or perfect patience. However, each time he fellowships with God, the divine love and the divine patience will increase within him. As he continuously contacts the Spirit, the divine life will operate within him until he expresses divine love and divine patience spontaneously. The branches of a tree constantly receive the supply from the roots. As the life sap flows within the branches, they will bloom and bear fruit spontaneously. The visible fruit is the overflow of the hidden life of the tree. Galatians 5:22-23 speaks of the nine Christian virtues. These virtues are the fruit of the Spirit; they are not the issue of human effort. When the Spirit works within us, the divine life is infused into us until we overflow with the fruit of the Spirit. Hence, fellowship is the key to every Christian experience. If we learn the lesson of fellowship, we will gradually enter into every spiritual experience.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowship Producing<br />
Gold, Pearl, and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>Our work should bring the brothers and sisters into the divine fellowship. Only this kind of work can produce gold, pearl, and precious stones. This kind of work will remain at the Lord&rsquo;s return. No matter how good a work may seem outwardly, it will not have any value if it is not gold, pearl, and precious stones. The Lord wants gold, pearl, and precious stones. When we bear the nature of gold, pearl, and precious stones, we will have the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. Otherwise, we are merely wood, grass, and stubble. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we remain in the divine fellowship and are filled with His rich and precious nature (1 Cor. 3:10-17; Rev. 21:18-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Spirit and Life</h2>
<p>God is not only the Spirit; He is also life (John 1:4). The Bible speaks of fellowship as the fellowship of life (1 John 1:1-3) as well as the fellowship of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1). Hence, the fellowship of life is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Life and the Spirit cannot be separated. Life depends on the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit contains life. As we learn to live in fellowship, we must know the Holy Spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Fellowship</h2>
<p>Romans 8 clearly portrays the Spirit and the divine life in our spirit. The Spirit of God with the life of God both dwell in our spirit and are joined to our spirit. It is difficult to discern whether the word <em>spirit</em> in Romans 8 and in other places in the New Testament denotes the Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit. In some verses, such as Romans 8:9 and 16, the word <em>spirit</em> is clearly designated. Verse 4, however, speaks of walking according to the spirit. In this verse <em>spirit</em> denotes the mingled spirit, that is, the Spirit mingled with our human spirit. Fellowship is of life and of the Spirit. Both the divine life and the Spirit dwell in our spirit. Hence, fellowship is altogether a matter in our spirit. In other words, the flow of our spiritual life occurs in our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit and our spirit are mingled as one spirit, and the Spirit contains the life of God. Hence, our mingled spirit involves the Spirit, our spirit, and the divine life. To illustrate, our spirit can be likened to a glass of water, the Spirit to a fruit-juice concentrate, and the divine life to sugar. When the three are mixed together, they become a fruit-water-sugar drink. The Spirit contains the divine life, and the Spirit is in our spirit. Hence, setting our mind on our mingled spirit is life (v. 6). The flow of life is in our mingled spirit. The divine life is always flowing in the Spirit, and this flow is in our spirit. Hence, in order to fellowship, we must turn to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT AND THE MIND</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Minding the Spirit and the Mind of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The deepest part of our being is our spirit, our body is the outermost part, and our soul is between our spirit and our body. Our soul is composed of three parts: mind, emotion, and will. In fallen man the mind is the strongest part of the soul, followed by the emotion and the will. Therefore, the mind represents the soul. Romans 12:2 says that we should &ldquo;be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; This verse does not say that transformation is by the renewing of our emotion or by the renewing of our will. This shows that our mind is the leading part of our soul. Romans 8:6 speaks of &ldquo;the mind set on the spirit,&rdquo; which in the original language is literally &ldquo;the mind of the spirit.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:3 says that formerly we fulfilled &ldquo;the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts.&rdquo; Here the thoughts represent the soul, and the flesh relates to the lusts of the physical body. This means that prior to our salvation, when we were dead in offenses and sins, we conducted ourselves according to our flesh and our mind. Hebrews says that God will impart His law of life into our mind (8:10) and that He will inscribe it upon our mind (10:16). At our salvation God put His law of life into our spirit. Now this law is spreading from our spirit into our soul, represented by our mind. In these verses the mind represents the soul. After the fall man&rsquo;s mind became the leading part of his person. The mind is the dominant and leading part of fallen man.</p>
<p>The divine life is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in our regenerated spirit. Therefore, the fellowship of the divine life is in our spirit. As human beings, our mind is our strongest part. Hence, if we desire to learn to fellowship with God, we must turn our mind to our spirit. Romans 8:5 speaks of minding the things of the Spirit. This means that we should use our mind to touch the things of the Spirit, which is also to turn our mind to our spirit in order to contact the Spirit. In other words, to mind the things of the Spirit is for the mind to contact the Spirit. In verse 6 <em>the mind set on the spirit</em> means that the mind is controlled by the spirit and has become the mind of the spirit.</p>
<p>According to verses 5 and 6, when we turn our mind to our spirit, our entire being enters into the divine fellowship. In order for our mind to be mingled with our spirit, it must be set on our spirit. When our mind is set on our spirit, it is under the control of our spirit and becomes the mind of our spirit. For this reason, when we have time alone to fellowship with the Lord, it is best to close our eyes so that our mind can turn to our spirit. When we close our eyes and contemplate quietly, we can muse on the Lord Jesus, on heavenly and spiritual things, and on the Word. Such contemplating will turn our mind to our spirit and issue in spiritual feelings, which in turn will help set our mind further on the sense in our spirit. This is the way that our mind becomes the mind of our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Advancing from the Mind of the Spirit<br />
to the Spirit of the Mind</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:23 also speaks of the mind and the spirit: &ldquo;That you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo; The expression <em>the spirit of your mind</em> is different from <em>the mind set on the spirit</em> used in Romans 8:6. The experience of Ephesians 4:23 is more advanced than what is described in Romans 8. With the mind set on the spirit, the mind is directed toward the spirit, but with the spirit of the mind, the spirit has entered into the mind. In Romans 8 the Spirit of God has entered into our spirit, but our mind is not yet occupied by our spirit. In Ephesians 4 our mingled spirit is in our mind, which represents our soul. In other words, the Spirit in our spirit has spread and entered into our mind. Hence, our mind is called the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>When we regularly turn our mind to contact our spirit, our mind will become the mind of our spirit. When we continue to exercise in this way, gradually our spirit will occupy our mind, because the Spirit of God mingled with our spirit will spread into our mind. Thus, we will have the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>Romans 8 also speaks of minding the things of the flesh and the mind set on the flesh (vv. 5, 7). When we set our mind on the things of the flesh, our mind becomes the mind of the flesh. The Lord delivers us when we turn our mind to the things of our spirit (v. 5). When we mind the flesh, our mind is turned away from our spirit, but when we mind our spirit, our mind is turned toward the depths of our being. By minding the spirit, our mind becomes the mind of the spirit, and the spirit gains its proper position. The issue of minding the spirit is life and peace. When we turn to our spirit, we touch the fellowship, and we receive the life supply.</p>
<p>Do not think that we are getting into too many details or that our analysis is too fine. Genuine spiritual experiences are very fine. In Mark 12:30 the Lord quoted the Old Testament, saying, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&rdquo; How fine this is! The Lord spoke of our heart, our soul, our mind, and our strength. The heart includes the soul, and the mind is a part of the soul. The heart, the soul, and the mind are related. Nevertheless, the Lord spoke of them separately. Our exercise in fellowship must be fine; otherwise, our experience will not be genuine. The things that we have mentioned are not doctrine; they are practical matters in our spiritual experience. We need to exercise in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship of the Spirit Being<br />
Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>To turn our mind to our spirit is to turn our being to God because He is in our spirit. Hence, the fellowship of our spiritual life is the fellowship of God. God is not only in the Spirit; He is the Spirit. Likewise, He is life. According to His person, God is Spirit, and according to His content, He is life. Whether we touch the fellowship of life or the fellowship of the Spirit, we are touching the fellowship of God; that is, we are touching God.</p>
<p>We can use electricity as an illustration. When we touch an electric current, we touch electricity. Electricity can be touched only through its current. Wherever there is an electric current, there is electricity. Similarly, if there is the fellowship of God, God is present; and if there is no fellowship of God, God is not present. We can touch God practically only when we are in fellowship. In the fellowship of God we touch the Spirit and the divine life.</p>
<p>God can have a relationship with us because He is the Spirit as well as life. Genesis 6:3 says, &ldquo;My Spirit will not strive with man forever, for he indeed is flesh.&rdquo; This word clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s desire to have a relationship with man is related to the Spirit. In order to have a deep relationship with man, God must enter into man. When He enters into man, He is not only the Spirit as a person but also as life, which is the content of God. When God enters into us, we have His Spirit as a person in us, and we have life as the content of God. Regarding His person, God is in us as the Spirit; regarding His content, God is in us as life. God being the Spirit refers to His person and nature, whereas God being life refers to His content. Hence, the fellowship of the Spirit is the fellowship of life, and it is also the fellowship of God. The divine flow within us is the Spirit as well as life. This flow is mutual; hence, it is also called fellowship. This mutual flow, this fellowship, is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fellowship Depending on<br />
the Flow of God&rsquo;s Spirit</h2>
<p>We can fellowship with one another because the flow of God is within us. There are many light bulbs in this room, and electricity is flowing through them and in them. Although there are many light bulbs, there is only one electric current. Another example is the blood circulating in our body. This circulation brings all the members in our body into fellowship. Likewise, the fellowship among the saints exists in the flow of the Spirit. When a brother praises God, there is an echo in our spirit; therefore, we also praise God. If his praise is not from the spirit, there will be no echo. However, if his praise comes from the spirit, there will be a response with us, because there is a flow of the Spirit. This also applies to prayer. If a brother&rsquo;s prayer is from his mingled spirit, his prayer will touch our spirit, because we are in the one fellowship of the Spirit. The Spirit is the flow and also our oneness.</p>
<p>The church does not need unity. The church needs oneness. The oneness of the saints is the fellowship, the flow of the Spirit. There are many saints, but there is one flow of the Spirit within us. When we live in this flow, we are one spontaneously; we do not need to be united. If we are fleshly, the flow will be blocked. This does not mean that the Spirit is not in us but that the flow of the Spirit is obstructed by the flesh. If we live in the spirit, we will respond to each other&rsquo;s spirit whenever we see one another, because we are in the same flow. If we do not fellowship in the one flow of the Spirit, our dealings with one another will merely be political and social. In spiritual terms such dealings are called leprosy.</p>
<p>When a person with a strong spirit invites a brother to a love feast out of a burden for fellowship, he is living in the spirit, even if the invitation is not accepted. Fellowship among the saints requires that both parties live in the spirit. If one party is not in the spirit, the flow will be cut off. Hence, it is possible to have fellowship with some saints but not with others. There is fellowship only when both parties are in their mingled spirit. Otherwise, there will not be a flow. Without the flow in our spirit, we are being political. Those who learn the lesson of fellowship are genuine, without pretension, disguise, or insincerity. They learn to live in spirit in singleness, simplicity, and purity.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT FOCUSING ON GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>We often live in our wandering mind, thinking about many things. As a result, we are turned away from our spirit. Our mind can even travel around the world. Evil people often think about evil things, and good people often think about good things. However, both evil and good people live in their mind, not in their spirit. Now that we are learning to live in the fellowship of the divine life, we should no longer live in the realm of good and evil. Instead, we should pay attention to whether or not we are living in our spirit.</p>
<p>When we love a certain thing, we should ask ourselves whether our love is from our spirit. If we love something as soon as we think about it, our love is not from our spirit. However, if we first turn our mind to our spirit and touch the sense within, the love that we express will come from our spirit. Similarly, if we hear an admonition and immediately adjust ourselves, this adjustment is not from our spirit. After hearing an admonition, we should immediately turn our mind to our spirit and live out what we touch in the divine fellowship. Then, if there is any adjustment, it will be an expression of life. As we learn to fellowship, we should always care for our spirit, not for good and evil. We should reject whatever is not of our spirit, even if it is very good. We should not make decisions based on the circumstances of persons, matters, or things. Every decision must be made according to the sense in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Always Turning Our Mind to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Everything that is apart from the Lord can draw us away from our spirit; praying and reading the Bible are not exceptions. Hence, we must learn to turn our mind to our spirit in every situation. A brother who can turn his mind from outward things to his spirit will become skilled in fellowship. This is the secret to genuine Christian experience, including the life, power, light, and authority of a believer. When a sister reads a spiritual book, she should seek the supply that is in her spirit. The book should not draw her mind from her spirit. The same principle applies to prayer. We should turn our mind to our spirit when we pray. Strong and thorough prayers are uttered when our mind is subject to our spirit and when our entire being is turned from our environment to our spirit. The longer we can remain in our spirit, the stronger our spirit will become. The more we live such a life, the stronger the meetings will be. Many brothers and sisters do not open their mouth in the meetings because their mind is turned from the spirit. Those who constantly turn their mind to the spirit can pray in any situation. Not only so, as soon as they open their mouth, their spirit is released. Only those who often turn their mind to their spirit know the sense in their spirit, receive light when they read the Bible, and are effective in the work.</p>
<p>While learning to fellowship, we should pay attention to our spirit, not to good and evil, because we cannot touch God unless we turn to our spirit. God is Spirit and life, and He dwells in us. May we not be those who turn from God but those who turn to God by touching the fellowship of life in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention Being<br />
That We Be Filled with Him</h2>
<p>Before the fall man lived before God, but after the fall man entered into the realm of good and evil. When we were saved, we returned to God&rsquo;s presence, and God entered into us. Good and evil are not the goal of a genuine Christian living. The genuine Christian living takes the indwelling God as its center. Hence, our Christian living should come from our mingled spirit, not our soul. The people in the world do not have God in them, nor do they live before Him. As a result, they live in the realm of good and evil, right and wrong.</p>
<p>Throughout human history there have been many sages and religionists, who taught that we should reject evil and pursue good. There are even quite a few believers in Christianity who regard the Lord&rsquo;s salvation merely as a solution to problems related to good and evil. Salvation, however, is not focused on solving problems related to good and evil. Salvation delivers us from the realm of good and evil to the realm of God. The purpose of salvation is not to deliver us from evil to good but to deliver us from everything that is apart from God to God Himself. In His eternal plan, God did not ordain that we be good men; He ordained that we be God-men. God does not desire to fill us with so-called goodness. He desires to fill us with Himself.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to be mingled with Him and to let Him live in us by taking Him as our life so that our entire being would be filled with His divine element. He not only wants us to have His life in our spirit, but He also desires that every part of our being&mdash;including our mind, emotion, and will in our soul and every part of our heart&mdash;would be filled with His life and nature. Eventually, even our physical body, which He made from the dust of the earth, will be filled with His divine element and conformed to His glorious body (Phil. 3:21). In order for God to accomplish His purpose, we must learn the lesson of fellowship, that is, learn to forget good and evil and turn to our spirit to touch God.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Old Testament Saints Musing on God<br />
and Living before Him</h2>
<p>The Old Testament saints knew that if they desired to live before God, they had to focus their minds on God and the things of God. Most of the words in the Psalms describe how the pious lived before God. They often turned their mind to God and to the things of God. To muse on Jehovah in the Psalms is equivalent to setting the mind on the spirit in Romans 8:6. The words of David in Psalm 104:34 are very precious. He said, &ldquo;May my musing be sweet to Him.&rdquo; A footnote in Darby&rsquo;s New Translation says that this can also be rendered, &ldquo;My meditation of him is shall be pleasant.&rdquo; On the one hand, God regards our musing to be sweet; He likes us to muse on Him. On the other hand, musing on God is sweet and pleasant to us. This is indeed true. When we muse on God, we feel sweet within. To muse on God is to turn our thoughts from everything apart from God to Him. Our person follows our thoughts and runs to whatever we think about. The expression <em>absent-minded</em> indicates that the mind is constantly running toward different things. When we muse on God, our mind runs toward God.</p>
<p>Psalm 1:2 speaks of a person whose delight is in the law of Jehovah and who meditates in His law by day and by night. This shows how much the Old Testament saints mused on God and lived before Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Beginning with Our Emotion</h2>
<p>Since the Spirit has entered into our spirit, we must turn to our spirit in order to contact God. However, we must remember that fallen man lives in the mind. The mind represents our person; hence, our person follows our mind. Although our mind represents our person, our mind cannot lead us, and even though it may seem as if we are being led by our will, we are actually being led by our emotion.</p>
<p>According to Psalm 1:2, a person who delights in the law of Jehovah muses on the law of God, meditating on it by day and by night. To delight in something involves our emotions. We cannot ask a person who dislikes God, does not consider Him to be sweet, and has no love for Him to set his mind on God. If our emotions do not like a certain thing, our mind is not of much help to us. A person who loves the world rather than God will fall asleep when he tries to mind the spirit.</p>
<p>We must turn our mind to our spirit in order to muse on God, but we also need to stir up our emotions so that we lean toward Him, long for Him, and love Him. This was the experience of the psalmists: &ldquo;As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God&rdquo; (42:1). Only those who love God will think of Him. Those who do not love God cannot be exhorted, much less be forced, to think about Him. In order for our mind to continually remember and consider God, our emotions must be touched by Him, encouraged by His love, and moved by His loveliness and sweetness.</p>
<p>Song of Songs speaks of the love of a believer toward the Lord. No other book in the Bible speaks as thoroughly of our fellowship with the Lord. According to Song of Songs, there must be love before there can be fellowship. This is also true in our dealings with others. If you do not love me, you will not want to fellowship with me. We fellowship regularly with those whom we love. Similarly, if we love the Lord, we will desire to fellowship with Him, and our mind will spontaneously turn to our spirit and muse on Him. Merely loving the Lord is not fellowship. Only by turning to our spirit can we enter into fellowship. Loving the Lord is the motive for fellowship. It is the main source that motivates us to fellowship with the Lord, but loving the Lord is not fellowship. In order to fellowship, we must touch our spirit with our mind.</p>
<p>In Romans 12 the apostle first exhorts us through the compassions of God, and then he speaks of being transformed by the renewing of our mind (vv. 1-2). His exhorting through the compassions of God is to stir up our emotion with God&rsquo;s love. The apostle knew that only when our emotion is moved will our mind turn to God and be transformed. When our emotions are inclined toward God and we love and desire Him, nothing will hinder our mind from turning to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Being Carried Out by Our Will</h2>
<p>In addition to our mind and emotion, we also have a will. There are several places in the Bible that speak of exercising the will in order to fellowship with the Lord. Imperative statements, such as &ldquo;hope in God&rdquo; (Psa. 42:5, 11; 43:5) and &ldquo;wait in silence for God alone&rdquo; (62:5), involve the exercise of the will. Even after our emotions are moved by His love and our mind turns to our spirit, we still need to exercise our will in order to fellowship. The decision to fellowship with God is the responsibility of our will.</p>
<p>An indifferent person has a weak will. It is difficult for such a one to learn the lesson of fellowship. Those who learn the lesson of fellowship have a strong will. When their emotions are not stirred up, they can exercise their will to turn their mind to their spirit. Their will is able to control their restless mind and turn it to their spirit. Those with a strong will can have deep fellowship with the Lord. Statements such as &ldquo;O my soul...Hope in God&rdquo; (42:5, 11; 43:5) and &ldquo;my soul, wait in silence for God alone&rdquo; (62:5) indicate that the psalmists were downcast and needed to exercise their strong will in order to direct their heart toward the Lord and thereby enter into fellowship.</p>
<p>The New Testament also shows the relationship between the will and fellowship. Statements such as &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 6:18), &ldquo;they ought always to pray&rdquo; (Luke 18:1), &ldquo;rejoice in the Lord&rdquo; (Phil. 3:1), &ldquo;casting all your anxiety on Him&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:7), and &ldquo;in nothing be anxious&rdquo; (Phil. 4:6) are in the imperative mood and command us to exercise our will in order to fellowship with the Lord. We often excuse ourselves and say that we cannot pray because we are not in a good mood or that our thoughts are scattered. Some believers say that they cannot pray because they are in a bad mood or because their mind is not calm. Such believers can be compared to a rudderless boat that is being directed only by the wind and the waves without a definite goal. The rudder, however, is needed to control, stabilize, and direct a boat to sail toward a definite goal, even when there is a storm. This illustrates the relationship between our will and fellowship.</p>
<p>Both our mind and our emotions are indispensable in learning to live in fellowship, but our will is more important. Our mind and our emotions are both unreliable. We behave one way when we are happy and another way when we are unhappy. Our will is our most reliable part; it is our rudder. A normal, noble, and proper person does everything by his will. He has feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, but he does not express himself based on these feelings, because he is controlled by his will. He may be grieved and feel the need to weep, but he is controlled by his will; hence, he shows no sign of grief. A person with a strong will knows how to use his mind to exercise discernment and caution, but his behavior is still controlled by his will. He is not without thoughts or emotions. His thoughts are rich, and his emotions are fervent, but they are under the control of his will.</p>
<p>Without a strong will, a person cannot stop his wandering mind or calm his agitated emotions. When such persons are angry, their anger is wild, and their love is intense and often unbearable. Such persons often fail because they lack a strong will as their rudder.</p>
<p>Although the Lord is in us as our life and power, He needs our cooperation in order to be expressed through us. When the Lord moves within us, there will be no effect if our will does not carry it out. Hence, we must adjust our mind, emotion, and will if we desire to live in fellowship with the Lord. Our mind is adjusted when it turns to our spirit. Our emotion is adjusted when we exercise to love God and make Him the unique object of our love. Our will is adjusted when we use it to carry out spiritual activities. When we feel down, we should exercise our will and pray or contemplate the Lord. When we do not have inspiration, we must exercise our will and pray from our spirit. We often say that we need to exercise our spirit, but the exercise of our spirit requires a strong will. A person who does not have a strong will does not have a strong spirit and cannot readily release his spirit. Such a person is either tossed about by his emotions or scattered in his mind. Hence, it is difficult for him to turn to his spirit and for his spirit to be released. In order to be freed from the encumbrances of our emotion and mind, we must have a strong will. Then we can force ourselves to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>If we practice exercising our will, both our mind and our emotions will be strengthened. By exercising his will, a brother who rarely thinks about God will begin to consider Him. Similarly, when a sister who is slothful in her emotions and is indifferent toward God exercises her will, she will love God and want to live in His presence. This also applies to the spirit. A brother who is deflated in his spirit often waits for his spirit to move, but this rarely happens. Instead, he should exercise his will to move his spirit and pray. Initially, this may be difficult, but if he continues to exercise his will in this regard, his spirit will become burning, and he will be unable to stop praying. Our spirit, our mind, and our emotion can become slothful, just as we can become lazy. Hence, we need to exercise our will in order to move our spirit, our mind, and our emotion.</p>
<p>A car is powered by gasoline, but in order for the gasoline to burn, the engine must be ignited. If instead of igniting the engine, a person waits for the gasoline to ignite by itself, the car will never start. A car is not driven by electricity, but electricity is needed in order for the engine to be ignited. Similarly, in order to pray or fellowship with the Lord, we do not rely on our will but on our spirit. However, it is vain to wait for our spirit to stir itself up. We must use our will to stir up our spirit, just as the ignition starts a car. Strictly speaking, exercising our spirit is equivalent to using our will to move our spirit. The only way to exercise our spirit is to use our will. As those who desire to learn to fellowship and pray, we must learn to exercise our will. If we do not learn to exercise our will, we will not learn to fellowship.</p>
<p>A brother who is not willing to pray should force himself to pray. He should force his mind to consider God. Initially, this may seem awkward. The Bible does not tell us to wait for our spirit to be moved. Rather, it uses imperatives in regard to praying, to proclaiming the word, to testifying, to praising, and to giving thanks in everything (Matt. 24:20; 2 Tim. 4:2; John 15:27; Psa. 22:23; 1 Thes. 5:18). This shows that we need to be active, to take the initiative, and to not wait passively. If we wait to be inspired, inspiration may never come. When we do not have an appetite for food, we must use our will and force ourselves to eat something. In spiritual matters, however, we often are not willing to force ourselves to exercise.</p>
<p>Many believers wait for inspiration, and they are not willing to move without inspiration. To them exercising their spirit is a man-made effort to stir up excitement. Instead of waiting for inspiration, we should exercise our will. When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to remember and worship Him, we should know that we are here to take care of business and not to wait for inspiration. A teacher does not wait to be inspired before she begins to teach her class. Since we are here to take care of business, we should exercise our will. To worship the Lord is a matter in spirit; hence, we ought to use our will to stir up the spirit to praise, pray, and call hymns. Regrettably, in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting some saints feel no obligation to take care of business. They use their will to direct their mind, rather than their spirit. Many saints are relaxed in spirit, and they do not use their will to direct their spirit to function. As a result, the meeting lacks the operation of the spirit. If our will is not exercised, our spirit will not be strong. As those who desire to live in fellowship, we must learn to exercise our will.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE HEART</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Parts of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The heart is another organ that is also related to fellowship. The soul is composed of three parts: the mind, the emotion, and the will. The will is the weakest part of the soul, and the mind is the strongest. The spirit is composed also of three parts: fellowship (John 4:24), intuition (1 Cor. 2:11), and conscience (Rom. 9:1; 8:16). The spirit of an unbeliever is dead. This does not mean that he does not have a spirit but that the function of his spirit toward God is dead. This also does not mean that his spirit is unable to function but that his spirit is insulated from God. His conscience still has some function. When a person is saved, his spirit is made alive, and it is renewed to become a new spirit. The most apparent function of this new spirit is still the conscience. A new believer often feels condemned, reproved, or lacking in peace in his spirit. This shows that the conscience is the strongest sense in his spirit. In contrast, the function of the intuition is relatively weak. The strongest part of his spirit is his conscience, and the weakest part is his intuition. If he regularly takes care of the feeling of his conscience, he will have fellowship, and while he is in fellowship, his intuition will be strengthened. In experience, we begin with the conscience and then proceed to fellowship and intuition.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, the first work of the Spirit is to touch people&rsquo;s conscience by causing them to feel condemned because of sin. Once their conscience is touched, they will draw near to the Lord. Then their prayer, which is fellowship, will come out of their spirit. Finally, in this fellowship, they will receive intuition. Hence, in a person&rsquo;s experience of salvation, the parts of the spirit function in the same order: first conscience, then fellowship, and lastly intuition.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Parts of the Heart</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, in addition to a spirit and a soul, man also has a heart. The heart is not an independent part; rather, it is composed of the three parts of the soul and one part of the spirit. The Bible speaks of the thoughts of the heart. Thoughts are a function of the mind, but Hebrews 4:12 speaks of thoughts in relation to the heart. This proves that the heart includes the mind. In Matthew 9:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?&rdquo; To think evil things is a function of the mind, but the Lord said that the function of thinking is related to the heart. This also proves that the heart includes the mind. Acts 2:26 says, &ldquo;My heart was made glad.&rdquo; In John 16:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Sorrow has filled your heart.&rdquo; Both being glad and being sorrowful are functions of the emotion. This proves that the heart includes the emotion. Hebrews 4:12 speaks also of the &ldquo;intentions of the heart.&rdquo; Intention is a function of the will. This proves that the heart includes the will. The heart is composed of the three parts of the soul: the mind, emotion, and will. Thus, it seems that the heart is the same as the soul. However, this is not so, because the heart also includes the conscience, which is not a part of the soul. Hebrews 10:22 speaks of &ldquo;having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo; This shows that the heart includes the conscience. Hence, the conscience, which is a part of the spirit, is also a part of the heart. We cannot find a verse in the Bible that speaks of the heart in relation to fellowship and intuition. If there were such verses, the heart would be a full combination of the spirit and the soul. However, the Bible speaks only of the heart in relation to one part of the spirit, which is the conscience. Concerning this point, the Chinese language is very meaningful. In Chinese the characters for <em>fellowship</em> and <em>intuition</em> do not contain the radical for <em>heart,</em> but the characters for <em>mind, emotion,will,</em> and <em>conscience</em> contain the radical for <em>heart,</em> just as the heart includes these four parts. In conclusion, the heart includes the three parts of the soul plus the conscience in the spirit.</p>
<p>Our heart is related to our fellowship with God. The kind of relationship that we have with God depends on the condition of our heart. Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; Psalm 73:1 says, &ldquo;Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; First John 3:21 says, &ldquo;If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; These verses show that our heart is the key to our fellowship with God. Because we desire to learn to fellowship, we must deal with our heart thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Four Crucial Points concerning<br />
Dealing with the Heart</h2>
<p>There are four crucial points concerning dealing with the heart. We need to deal with our heart until it is pure, loving, soft, and at peace.</p>
<p>Being pure in heart is mainly related to the mind and the emotion. On the negative side, we need to exercise so that our mind is not confused and our emotions are not impulsive. On the positive side, we must exercise so that our mind considers only God and our emotions love only God. This is to have a pure heart, to have a single heart, and to consider and love God in singleness of heart.</p>
<p>A loving heart is a heart that loves God. Mark 12:30 says, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&rdquo; Love involves the emotional part of our heart.</p>
<p>To have a soft heart refers to our will. Being soft is the opposite of being hard. Initially, our will is hardened and rebellious, but after it is dealt with, our will becomes softened and pliable. In Ezekiel 36:26 God says, &ldquo;I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.&rdquo; Our original heart is as hard as a stone, but at our salvation God gives us a heart of flesh, which is soft. Those whose will has been dealt with have a soft heart.</p>
<p>To be at peace is related to our conscience. When there is an offense in our conscience, there is no peace in our heart. Once the offense is removed, our heart is at peace.</p>
<p>To deal with the heart is to deal with the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our mind and our emotion need to be dealt with until they are single and pure. Then our heart will be pure. Our emotion needs to be dealt with until it loves God. Then our heart will be loving. Our will needs to be dealt with until it is subdued. Then our heart will be soft. Our conscience needs to be dealt with until there are no offenses. Then our heart will be at peace. Only a heart that is pure, loving, soft, and at peace is a proper heart. Our heart can maintain a proper relationship with God and have fellowship with Him only when our mind is pure in considering Him, our emotion is single in loving Him, our will is submissive to Him, and our conscience is at peace with Him. This is the lesson of fellowship. If we exercise accordingly, we will touch God. If we deal with our heart in regard to being pure, loving, soft, and at peace, we will enter into fellowship. May God be gracious to us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will speak about the difference between the spirit and the soul. This matter is closely related to the matter of fellowship. Differentiating the soul from the spirit is a basic matter. We need to know how to differentiate the soul from the spirit in order to learn the matter of fellowship, but we also need to be able to differentiate between the two for the sake of our entire Christian life, which involves our living, walk, work, and service. The life of the soul is the natural life; hence, our soul is the source of our natural man. After regeneration, our spirit receives the divine life of God. Hence, our spirit is the source of our spiritual man. The soul of a regenerated believer is the outer man, and the spirit of a regenerated believer is the inner man. The soul is the old man, and the spirit is the new man; the soul is the first man, and the spirit is the second man. The soul does not have God&rsquo;s life. Both the Spirit and God&rsquo;s life are located in our spirit. Even before the fall, man&rsquo;s soul was incapable of contacting and receiving God. This is true of man&rsquo;s condition before the fall, but especially after the fall. This is because the soul is not the proper organ for contacting God; the unique organ for contacting God is the human spirit.</p>
<p>Due to the fall, the soul became the center of man&rsquo;s person, his personality, that is, the &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The soul contains nothing of God; moreover, it cannot contact God. Instead, God created man with a human spirit. The human spirit is the deepest part of man. God created us with a human spirit so that we could contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him. Our spirit is a vessel for containing God. When God comes into us, He does not enter into our soul; He enters into our spirit.</p>
<p>As those who are saved, we should express the Lord in our living, work, testimony, and service. Everything must begin in our spirit because the Lord is in our spirit. Before our salvation we lived only according to our soul, because our spirit was deadened. However, even though our spirit has been made alive through the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we are not used to living by our spirit. Instead, because of our habitual living according to our soul, we live by our soul. Consequently, following our salvation, God gradually delivers us from a living that is according to our soul to a living that is according to our spirit. All the shining and dealing of the Holy Spirit are related to this purpose. Regrettably, many works in Christianity today are contrary to God&rsquo;s work. God desires that His children be delivered from the soul to live in the spirit, but many works in Christianity only strengthen the soul, making God&rsquo;s children even more soulish.</p>
<p>Living by the spirit rather than by the soul sounds simple, but, in fact, it is not easy. This is because our soul is our self, and being delivered from the soul and not living by the soul mean that we need to be delivered from our self. This is not simple. From the day that we were born, we have been living according to our soul; we are accustomed to this kind of living. Furthermore, we all love our self and are more considerate of our self than of anyone else. Our self-love is an expression of our love for our soul. If we desire not to live according to our soul, we must not only understand the difference between the soul and the spirit but also pay a great price to learn this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE STEPS TO BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SELF</h2>
<p>There are three steps related to being delivered from the self.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Difference<br />
between the Soul and the Spirit<br />
through Revelation</h2>
<p>We must begin by asking God to show us that our soul, as our natural life, our old man, cannot comprehend spiritual things or receive God (1 Cor. 2:11-14). God&rsquo;s Spirit and life are in our spirit. We must see this revelation; it must be more than a matter involving outward comprehension. Many people understand that there is a difference between the soul and the spirit, but they cannot be delivered from their self because this has not become a matter of revelation to them. Only those who have revelation and are enlightened truly detest living according to their soul and are thus enabled to be gradually delivered from their self.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecrating Ourselves and<br />
Receiving the Discipline of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Consecration means offering ourselves to God to allow Him to work on us; consecration is not primarily about our working for Him. God&rsquo;s basic work on us is to deliver us from our soul so that we would live in our spirit. Before He works on us, however, He wants to obtain our permission, which is our consecration. This can be compared to a doctor obtaining permission from a patient before an operation. If the patient does not agree, the doctor will not do anything. Learning the matter of fellowship helps us to be delivered from the self; however, this practical deliverance depends upon God&rsquo;s work. Consequently, we need to consecrate ourselves to allow God to do His work.</p>
<p>After we genuinely offer ourselves to God, He will start to work on us. This work is often referred to as the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes God will raise up a situation that strikes a blow to our self, or He will arrange an environment to break us. For example, a person who has a very clear mind and who is thorough in all his considerations may be very self-confident. God rescues such a person by raising up the environment that deals with his thorough considerations and self-confidence. Just when he thinks that he has considered a certain matter thoroughly, the Lord will deliberately allow him to make a serious mistake, causing him to no longer be as confident of his own considerations. Oftentimes, people who live by their strong emotions and who help others out of good intentions receive little appreciation for their help. This is a dealing from God that shows them their help is based on their own emotional needs and natural kindness.</p>
<p>It is not easy to turn our mind to our spirit, and it is even harder to divide soul from spirit. Since we habitually live in our soul, the blows that we receive through our environment are needed. Regrettably, some people receive many blows, but they are not delivered from the self. This is because they do not see that the purpose of these blows from God is to train them to no longer live according to their soul&mdash;the outer man. Those who are unwilling to consecrate themselves to cooperate with God&rsquo;s work in this regard will suffer in vain and not learn any lessons. Hence, when we suffer a blow, we should renew our consecration so that we can receive the full benefit of God&rsquo;s dealing. If we consecrate ourselves and also seek God&rsquo;s enlightenment about the events, He will show us how we have been living by our soul, that is, by our thoughts, preferences, and opinions. When God raises up the environment to deal with us, it is for the purpose of delivering us from living according to our soul to living according to our spirit.</p>
<p>From the day that we were saved, God has been arranging our environment in order to deal with us. Romans 8:28 speaks of all things working together for good. This refers to the environments arranged by God for our breaking. Many people think that God causes all things to work together to fulfill their wishes, but they ignore the matter of being conformed to the image of His Son, mentioned in the following verse. If everything worked together to fulfill our wishes, how could we be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son? The things that work together for us to be conformed to the image of His Son are not things that go smoothly for us. Instead, God uses every difficult environment to break our soul. Without the breaking of our outer man, our soul, we could never be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son.</p>
<p>Those who sustain many wounds and cuts are most blessed by God because they are being delivered from the self. It is a mercy from God to be frustrated in everything and to be rebuffed by Him at every turn. God does not want us to be whole in our self; He wants us to be broken and delivered from our soul. Hence, those who really love the Lord and are blessed by Him often receive His discipline, because the Lord desires to perfect them. The Lord&rsquo;s discipline has a good intention; His striking comes out of His love and desire to deliver us from our soul so that we may live in our spirit. When the Lord disciplines us through small and big things, our outer man&mdash;the soul&mdash;is gradually broken, and we are gradually delivered from our soul to live in our spirit.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s work in our environment is related to dealing with our soul. Every environment that we encounter is according to God&rsquo;s arrangement. God knows that our soul must be thoroughly dealt with in order for our spirit to come forth. For this reason, He raises up environments to deal with the strongest parts of our soul, and after repeated dealings, the strength of these parts begins to wither. Then when we encounter new situations that touch these parts, we will not rely on our soul as we once did; instead, we will respond from our spirit. Being delivered from our soul and living by our spirit are not a matter of knowing doctrines. Doctrines can only create a desire within us to not live in the soul. Nevertheless, even having such a desire is a beginning. When we have such a desire, we need to allow God to work on us, to discipline us through the Holy Spirit. Consequently, we need to consecrate ourselves so that we will willingly receive God&rsquo;s work on us. In this way, we will be delivered from our soul and live by our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Enlightening</h2>
<p>Revelation involves enlightenment, but enlightenment is also practical. Although we need to be enlightened in regard to the difference between the soul and the spirit, we need a practical shining upon the different aspects of our soul. We must realize that there is still an element of the self within us even after we receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, even as we learn to not rely upon our soul to respond to the things that we encounter, elements of our soul are still involved and can be easily mixed into our response. At such a time, we do not need another striking; rather, we need the Lord&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit...and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; This refers to God&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. Even after we receive the Lord&rsquo;s striking and breaking and even if we become useful to the Lord, there are still elements of our self in our thoughts and intentions. Thus, we need the Lord&rsquo;s practical enlightenment. When God&rsquo;s light comes to us, we will see the mixture in our soul and turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>We often think that a certain matter is altogether of the Lord and for the Lord, but because we are short of light, we have little realization that there is some mixture in our thoughts and intentions. With the Lord&rsquo;s shining, we often see that many things, which we thought were free from any selfish intention, were actually full of selfish intent. Under God&rsquo;s shining, we will detest our self even more and be even more ashamed of the self than before. God&rsquo;s light exposes us to the point that we see our condition as He sees it. Then the light will cause us to prostrate ourselves even more deeply before God, and it will also deliver us more from the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF BEING DELIVERED<br />
FROM THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Let us consider an example in order to see the application of these three steps. Suppose a certain brother has a strong mind and typically lives by this aspect of his soul. When he hears a message on living by the spirit, he longs to live such a life. The Holy Spirit will begin to work in him by revealing the difference between the soul and the spirit. Then a desire to be dealt with will rise up in him, and he will consecrate himself to the Lord. When the Lord accepts his consecration and begins to deal with him, the thoughts that once directed his mind will no longer produce the same results. Previously, his plans always seemed to work out, but now everything seems to turn out wrong. After passing through repeated dealings that expose his reliance upon his mind, he will become fearful and no longer have full confidence in his thoughts. This striking is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. After experiencing the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, he will not depend on his thoughts, and it will become easier for him to live by his spirit.</p>
<p>At this point in this brother&rsquo;s experience, he may think that he has been fully delivered from his self. However, God will continue to shine upon him, showing him that he has not been fully delivered, because there are still soulish elements mixed with his thoughts. Although there is an element of God in his mind, there is a substantial amount of the self as well. With God&rsquo;s further shining, the element of mixture in his mind is gradually sifted out by God. In his initial experiences of God&rsquo;s dealing, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s discipline struck a fundamental blow to his mind. This later shining sifts out the elements of mixture that still remain in his mind. Thus, he is purified through God&rsquo;s shining. Then when he administrates the church, ministers the word, or touches other spiritual matters, he can do so without any mixed intentions.</p>
<p>Living by the spirit rather than the soul is one thing, but being pure without mixture is another thing. A person may be able to live according to the spirit without being completely pure. In order to be pure, we still need to experience God&rsquo;s further shining. Only those who are continually being shined upon can be pure. Please do not regard this as mere doctrine. Unless we love the Lord, pursue Him, and seek His pleasure, we cannot learn these lessons in a solid way. Although innumerable people have been saved throughout the centuries, not many have overcome to the point of being firstfruits. According to the book of Revelation, it is the overcomers in the churches, not the church as a whole, who satisfy God&rsquo;s heart. Hence, in the seven epistles in chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation, there is a continual call for overcomers. Although some Christians love the Lord very much, they do not live according to the spirit, and even fewer are overcomers who have been delivered from the soul to live by the spirit.</p>
<p>Today the Lord needs overcomers. Over the past two thousand years the gospel has been spread by the overcomers, His testimony has been maintained by the overcomers, Satan has been defeated by the overcomers, and God&rsquo;s life has flowed out through the overcomers. Every overcomer learns to live before God, that is, to live in the spirit and by the spirit. The overcomers uphold the life and testimony of the church. Throughout the generations the general situation of the church can be characterized as being dead (3:1), but the overcomers continue the testimony of the church. They will usher in God&rsquo;s kingdom and meet the Lord at His return. May the Lord grant us grace so that we may follow the footsteps of the overcomers to pay the price and allow ourselves to be severely broken in order to be delivered thoroughly from our soul to live in our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />
AND THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the soul and the spirit from the aspect of incarnation and from the aspect of death and resurrection. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; This means that the Lord Jesus is God coming to be a man. The Lord Jesus is God entering into man; hence, He is the mingling of divinity with humanity. When He lived on the earth, He expressed God in man. In the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation divinity entered into humanity. In His death and resurrection humanity entered into divinity. Through His incarnation God could live in man, and through His death and resurrection man could live in God. Through incarnation there was a man on earth in whom God lived. Through death and resurrection there is a man in heaven who has entered into God. Incarnation is the mingling of God with man. Death and resurrection are the mingling of man with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INCARNATION BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF SALVATION,<br />
AND DEATH AND RESURRECTION BEING<br />
THE PRINCIPLE OF OVERCOMING</h2>
<p>Incarnation is the principle of salvation. Hence, salvation is God entering into man, God being joined to man, and divinity mingling with humanity. The living of a believer after his salvation is an overcoming living in the principle of death and resurrection. Hence, overcoming is man entering into God, man being joined with God, and humanity mingling with divinity. Incarnation involves God coming to the earth; death and resurrection involve man entering into heaven. Likewise, our salvation is God coming to the earth, and our overcoming is our entering into heaven. Therefore, the principle of salvation is incarnation, and the principle of overcoming is death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />
NOT ANNULLING THE SOUL</h2>
<p>If we desire to live an overcoming life, we must live in the principle of death and resurrection; that is, we must live in the mingling of humanity with divinity. Such a living does not annul our humanity. On the contrary, in such a living our humanity is strengthened with divinity. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; In the first part of this verse Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo;; hence, it is &ldquo;no longer I who live.&rdquo; Yet in the latter part of this verse he says, &ldquo;The life which I now live,&rdquo; showing that an &ldquo;I&rdquo; still lives. This indicates that in an overcoming living our humanity is not annulled. Rather, our humanity is mingled with divinity.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden, Adam lived by the life of the soul. His soul was his person, and his spirit was an organ, a vessel. The soul of a believer, however, is no longer his person because his soul-life has been crucified. Hence, a believer should live by the divine life in his spirit. Since the soul-life has been crucified, our human element seemingly has been annulled. However, since the overcoming living of a believer involves the mingling of divinity with humanity, our human element has not been annulled. How can we explain this?</p>
<p>In incarnation God became the man Jesus the Nazarene. As a man, He possessed a soul, without which He would not have been a man. When He was crucified, His human life and nature were put to death, not His divine life and nature. Jesus the Nazarene possessed the human life, and He possessed the divine life of God. Adam had only the human life. Hence, once his human life died, he was finished. However, after the Lord died, He resurrected. He resurrected from the dead because the life of God was in Him. This life is the power of God. Furthermore, in His resurrection, the Lord&rsquo;s humanity was resurrected by His divinity. When we were regenerated, we were made alive by the life of God, and our humanity was enlivened by divinity. Now in our Christian living our human life is being brought into the life of God, and our humanity is being brought into divinity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our soul-life was put to death on the cross, but on the other hand, the functions of our soul, according to our humanity, were resurrected with the Lord Jesus. Hence, our human element is being brought into God&rsquo;s life and thus lives as our resurrected &ldquo;I.&rdquo; This is what the second part of Galatians 2:20 says: &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; here has passed through death and resurrection and is able to live in the faith of the Son of God. This new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the resurrected &ldquo;I,&rdquo; who has been brought into God through the resurrection of Christ and has been joined to Christ. Hence, this &ldquo;I&rdquo; can be joined to the faith of Christ and can live in the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation there is not only death but also resurrection. Every experience of being put to death is followed by resurrection. When God puts our soul to death, He does not intend to annul the functions of our soul but rather to let them pass through death and enter into resurrection so that we can be strengthened with the divine life. One day our body will die and enter into resurrection to become a glorified body. Without entering into death, our soul is independent of God and cannot be mingled with Him. Only when our soul has been put to death and has entered into resurrection will it cease to be independent of God and thus enter into God. Then our spirit will become our dominant part, and our soul will be subordinate to our spirit. Furthermore, our soul will be completely under the direction of our spirit. This can be compared to mixing bronze with gold. In order for these two metals to be mixed together, they must be melted. The bronze does not disappear; rather, it is blended with the gold. In the same principle, after we experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit and the putting to death by the cross, the functions of our soul are resurrected by the life of God and are mingled with the life of God. Just as bronze and gold are first melted and then blended together to form an alloy of bronze and gold, so our soul-life must die and enter into resurrection in order to be mingled with God. Our humanity is mingled with divinity and, as a result, is strengthened and enriched with the divine nature.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SOUL BEING TRANSFORMED<br />
THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work in us is in the principle of death and resurrection. Prior to our salvation, our spirit was dead, but through His death and resurrection, the Lord regenerated us and enlivened our spirit. Now our spirit has not only been enlivened, but our spirit is living because of, according to, and by the Spirit and the divine life. At the time of our regeneration, our deadened spirit was enlivened. However, our soul and our body still remained in their fallen condition. The work of God&rsquo;s salvation, thus, must reach our soul and our body. Hence, our soul and our body need to experience the Lord&rsquo;s death in order to be saved. Many portions in the Bible speak of the soul being put to death, such as, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man [the soul] has been crucified with Him&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6); &ldquo;I [the soul] am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20); &ldquo;Whoever loses it [his soul-life] will preserve it alive&rdquo; (Luke 17:33); &ldquo;Whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it&rdquo; (9:24); and &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself [lose his soul-life]&rdquo; (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34). These verses speak of the soul&rsquo;s experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; <em>Dies</em> in this verse is equivalent to the word <em>loses</em> in the aforementioned verses. The dying of a grain of wheat is the death of its shell; the losing of the soul refers to the death of the soul. When our soul is put to death, the Spirit has the opportunity to work in us to enliven our soul by transforming it (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation in Romans 12 and 2 Corinthians 3 is not for our spirit, because our spirit received the life of God at the time of our salvation. The work of transformation after our salvation involves the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;the three parts of our soul. The transformation of our soul can be accomplished only through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>From the time of our regeneration until the time we are raptured, we must pass through three stages. At the time of our salvation our spirit was enlivened. Now that we are saved, our soul needs to be transformed. Finally, our body will be transfigured at the time of the rapture. Each stage in this process of transformation is according to the principle of death and resurrection. Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This means that God will give life to our mortal body through the Spirit of life who is dwelling in our spirit. This word is fulfilled in us when the Spirit supplies our weak body with life so that we are empowered to serve God. The ultimate fulfillment of this word will be at the transfiguration of our body in the future. Although our body will die one day, it will be resurrected by the divine life. Death and resurrection are the principle by which God works in saving our soul. Our soul can be delivered only through death and resurrection. This also applies to our body.</p>
<p>The principle of death and resurrection implies transformation. After death and resurrection our soul is not annulled; rather, it is transformed. Transformation means that the element of God is added to our being. Formerly, our soul did not have God&rsquo;s element, but after experiencing death and resurrection, the divine element is added to our soul. In other words, transformation through death and resurrection brings our soul, which was previously unrelated to God, into God. As a result, our soul possesses the element of God. Hence, the principle of death and resurrection is to bring people who are outside of God completely into God by constituting them with the divine element. Our body is still outside of God. But it will be transfigured and brought into God when we are raptured in the future. At that time, our body will not only be intimately related to God; it will also contain His element.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIVE STEPS OF DEATH</h2>
<p>Our soul is transformed through the process of death and resurrection. Our soul-life must die in order for us to be transformed. Where there is death, there is resurrection, and there is also transformation. We experience death in the following ways.</p>
<p>First, our old man, our soul-life, was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6). This is of God. When the Lord died on the cross, the life of our soul was crucified with Him. Hence, objectively speaking, our soul-life was terminated on the cross when the Lord was crucified. We were crucified at the same time and in the same place that He was crucified. This is also when the Lord bore our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). This is an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>Our soul-life was crucified together with the Lord on the cross. This is an accomplished fact. Now the Holy Spirit gives us the revelation that we need to experience dying together with the Lord. This is the second step.</p>
<p>Third, based on the revelation that we receive, we can rise up to deny and to reject the soul-life. In our experience, we first see that we were crucified together with the Lord. Then we need to experience our being crucified together with the Lord. We must rise up to reject and to deny our soul-life, that is, to lose our soul-life. This step is not so easy to carry out. It requires the cooperation of our will.</p>
<p>Fourth, in coordination with our desire to lose our soul-life, the Holy Spirit arranges our environment in order to discipline us. If the Spirit does not work in our environment, it will be very difficult for us to lose our soul-life. Hence, God uses our outward environment to help us fulfill our inner desire of denying our soul-life.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Holy Spirit shines upon us to show us that in various matters we are still full of the element of our soul. This is a deeper shining of the Holy Spirit. These are the five steps of death that we experience.</p>
<p>As Christians, the lessons that we learn depend upon these five steps. Our growth and maturity in life also depend on these five steps. By experiencing these five steps, our problems will be solved. This is the way for us to lose our soul-life, for our old man to be crucified, and for us to deny our self.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR SOUL BEING UNDER<br />
THE CONTROL OF OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Where there is death, there is resurrection. Death opens the way for resurrection power to work in us. Without death, God&rsquo;s resurrection power cannot work on our soul. We can use the illustration of installing electric cables in a house. Electricity can flow wherever electric cables are installed. This example shows the relationship between death and resurrection. Death can be compared to the electric cables, and resurrection, to electricity. Death was not the end of the Lord. After death He was resurrected. The resurrected Lord is even more glorious than He was in the flesh. In the same principle, after experiencing death and resurrection, our soul will be uplifted, enriched, and strengthened with the divine life. A flower is prettier than its seed. If a seed does not pass through death, it cannot be resurrected and grow to become a beautiful flower. Something that is in resurrection is always more glorious than something that has not experienced death.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:14 mentions &ldquo;the fainthearted.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>fainthearted</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;little-souled.&rdquo; A sister who is little-souled cannot bear much burden; she becomes anxious and distressed when something happens. She is also unforgiving toward those who offend her. Such a believer can be saved from being little-souled only by experiencing death and resurrection. By means of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, her natural life will enter into death and then resurrection, and her soul will be uplifted and strengthened. After experiencing death and resurrection, Paul&rsquo;s soul was uplifted. For this reason, he could be greatly used by the Lord to the point that he could testify before King Agrippa and Festus, the Roman governor (Acts 26:24-29). This shows Paul&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Some people may think that if the soul is uplifted and strengthened, it will suppress the spirit. This is not the case. Initially, however, when man&rsquo;s soul did not have the element of God, it could suppress the spirit. But after man&rsquo;s soul experiences death and resurrection, he receives more of God&rsquo;s element, and his soul comes under the ruling of his spirit. Suppose some bandits are recruited by the government and become officials in the army. In their new position they must obey the government&rsquo;s orders. Similarly, in the past our soul was small, independent of God, and disobeyed the spirit&rsquo;s command. After we experience death and resurrection, our soul is uplifted, but it remains under the control of our spirit. After we experience death and resurrection, our thoughts are enriched, our emotions are more fervent, and our will becomes stronger. Thus, all three parts of our soul are subject to our spirit and are controlled by our spirit; hence, they become more useful to the Lord. This is the difference between the natural soul and the soul that has been transformed. The natural soul is fallen. The basic principle of being fallen is being independent of God. This is also the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, because man cannot live apart from God. When the soul is transformed, it is no longer independent of God; it is under the control of the spirit.</p>
<p>Before we are able to differentiate between our spirit and our soul, we do not depend on God. It is not that we are not willing to depend on Him, but because we do not feel a need to depend on Him, we can make proposals and depend on our insight. After we experience death and resurrection, there is a change in our nature, and we become dependent on God. The work of death and resurrection causes us to have a change in nature because the divine element is added to our human element. God&rsquo;s element is in our resurrected soul, because the Spirit of life, who is God Himself, has enlivened our soul. As a result, our soul likes to depend on God and no longer likes to give opinions or to have preferences. In such a soul, divinity is mingling with humanity; hence, this soul is under the ruling and control of the spirit. This is the situation of a believer who is experiencing death and resurrection.</p>
<p>James 1:8 speaks of a double-souled man. A double-souled person is often double-minded; it is hard for him to make a decision, and he tends to be doubtful, distrustful, and indecisive. This kind of person can be saved only through death and resurrection. After experiencing death and resurrection, such a believer will become decisive and will also be firm and stable. This is the issue of the natural soul being transformed in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING SPIRITUAL AND<br />
BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S IMAGE</h2>
<p>When we were saved, our spirit was enlivened, but nothing happened in our soul and our body. From the time of our regeneration, God began to work in order to save our soul. Through death and resurrection we can enter into Him and receive His element. One day, after entering into resurrection, our body will be transfigured to become a glorified body. At that time, our humanity will have been completely brought into divinity. Therefore, from the day we were regenerated until the day we meet the Lord, God&rsquo;s work in us is directed toward the transformation of our soul and the transfiguration of our body. This process of transformation involves death and resurrection. The result of transformation is our humanity being mingled with divinity. By such a mingling we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son; that is, we are transformed into the same image as the Lord, from glory to glory (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18). When people contact a believer who is in this process, they sense the flavor of God. Such a believer&rsquo;s thoughts, preferences, views, and proposals have the flavor of God. This is a spiritual person; his nature and his image have changed, because he has been transformed into the same image as the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVINITY AND HUMANITY BEING MINGLED</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God was merely on the throne; He did not possess humanity. Today God is in us, and He is God yet man. Through the steps of incarnation, death, and resurrection the Lord accomplished redemption. Through incarnation God was mingled with man, and through death and resurrection man was mingled with God. Today the Lord Jesus is in heaven as a &ldquo;prototype,&rdquo; and God has a universal, great factory in which He is mass-producing this prototype. God&rsquo;s work today is to conform us to the image of the Lord; that is, God is working for the mingling of divinity and humanity.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden Adam&rsquo;s soul was his person. His spirit was merely an organ, a vessel; his spirit was not his person. The Lord Jesus is God and man, and He has both divinity, the divine element, and humanity, the human element. We have received Him into our spirit. Therefore, in our spirit we have both the divine nature with the divine personality and the human nature with the human personality. This human personality, however, is not natural but has gone through death and resurrection. Nevertheless, in our soul we still have our natural personality. Hence, as believers, we have two persons in us. In our spirit is the new man, who is of resurrection; in our soul is the old man, who is natural. Every believer has such a dual personality. The Lord is working to bring the natural personality in our soul into death and resurrection. Then the person in our soul will express the person in our spirit. In this way our soul will be one with our spirit, and God and man will be completely mingled together. Thus, God is mingled with man, and man is mingled with God, but neither God nor man will be annulled. The soul of a spiritual man is never annulled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT EPISTLES<br />
EXPRESSING THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The mingling of God and man is clearly seen in the Epistles of the apostles. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have Paul&rsquo;s flavor, and John&rsquo;s Epistles have John&rsquo;s style. There are clear distinctions between the writings of Paul and John. If spirituality annuls our humanity, the style and flavor of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament would be the same. However, they are altogether distinct. These distinctions show that salvation does not annul our humanity but rather strengthens our humanity. Our salvation would be meaningless if it annulled our humanity. Before his salvation, Paul lived independently of God; he neither had the divine element in him, nor was he subject to the divine authority. However, after his salvation, Paul had the divine element, and he was subject to the divine authority. Furthermore, his human element was not annulled; instead, it was strengthened and enriched by the addition of the divine element. Since Paul was mingled with God, in his Epistles we can see not only Paul, but even more, we can see God. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles are not merely the speaking of the Holy Spirit; they are the speaking of the Holy Spirit mingled with Paul. Hence, we can say that they are Paul&rsquo;s speaking, and we can also say that they are God&rsquo;s speaking. Similarly, on the one hand, the Epistles by Peter, James, and John have the divine flavor, but on the other hand, they have the flavor of Peter, James, and John.</p>
<p>The more spiritual a person is, the more distinct his personality will be, because his personality will be mingled with God&rsquo;s personality. The twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are not the same color. The foundations are precious stones, but each is distinct. There is jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, and amethyst (Rev. 21:19-20). Similarly, no two believers are exactly alike. Hence, we cannot imitate, replicate, or replace one another. Our Christ is so great that He needs millions of believers to express Him. The Old Testament presents many types of Christ, because He has many aspects that need to be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST GOAL OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Our fellowship with God does not annul our humanity. Rather, through fellowship divinity is mingled with humanity. This is the basic principle of God&rsquo;s work in His salvation. The purpose of salvation is not to annul man but to transform man. Furthermore, God is our salvation. The life and nature of God uplift and strengthen our humanity. It is not that man is fallen and thus needs to be saved. Even if man were not fallen, he would still need to be saved. We need to be saved not merely because we fell into sin, into the world, or have become flesh. We need to be saved because we, created men, are out of the earth, earthy. In order for an earthy man to become heavenly, he must go through the process of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Before Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, he was out of the earth (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:45-47), and thus he was earthy and was unrelated to heaven and the things in the heavenlies. He belonged to the earthly kingdom, not the heavenly kingdom. He needed to be saved in order to participate in the things of heaven. This can be likened to a person who is on the first floor of a house needing to ascend if he wants to be on the second floor. Adam was not only earthly and incompatible with the heavenly God, but he also lacked the life of God and was incompatible with God, who is life. People think that man needs to be regenerated because he is corrupt. However, even if man were not corrupt, he would still need to be regenerated because he lacks God&rsquo;s life. Even before Adam fell, while he was uncorrupted, he did not have the life of God; thus, he needed to be regenerated in order to have God&rsquo;s life and nature. Once we receive God&rsquo;s life and nature, our human nature is uplifted. Formerly, we were earthly men, but now we have become heavenly God-men.</p>
<p>Every saved person has a nature that is superior to Adam&rsquo;s nature. Adam was merely a man of dust, but every saved person is a man of gold. Although the believers have not yet become completely golden, they have the element of gold. Adam had a body that was created out of dust, but the body of a believer will one day be changed into a glorified body. Even though our body is still of dust, it has begun to change, because the element of God is in us. Hence, our body is gradually being uplifted in nature. Adam&rsquo;s spirit was not his person; it was a created, limited spirit. The spirit of a believer is mingled with God and has an uncreated element and an unlimited nature, that is, the divine Spirit. As a result, our spirit is superior to Adam&rsquo;s spirit. Hence, even if man had not fallen, he would still need salvation, because man is merely a creature without the uncreated element; he is earthly, not heavenly.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING TO UPLIFT<br />
AND STRENGTHEN HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Created man is finite and earthly; God is uncreated, infinite, and heavenly. God is great and high, and we are small and low; hence, we cannot communicate with Him. Even if we had not sinned or fallen into the world and become the flesh, we would still be low. Thus, we need to be saved.</p>
<p>As human beings, we are not only low but also fallen. God&rsquo;s salvation first saves us out of our fallen situation and then uplifts us. When the infinite, eternal, high, and heavenly God enters into us, we have a change in nature. Our humanity is uplifted and strengthened. Salvation changes our nature from being low and limited to being high and unlimited. God saves us by entering into us and mingling Himself with us so that we can partake of His life and nature and obtain His element. The result of this mingling is that we can fellowship with God. However, neither God nor man is annulled.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:15 says, &ldquo;The spiritual man discerns all things.&rdquo; A spiritual man can discern all things because he has unlimited insight and heavenly wisdom. A limited man cannot discern all things; only an unlimited man can discern all things. Both unlimited insight and heavenly wisdom come from God; they are eternal. The extent of our unlimitedness is determined by the degree of our spirituality. It is not possible to know to what extent a spiritual man can love others; even he himself does not know the extent to which he can love others, because he is unlimited. A spiritual man also has unlimited power. In Ephesians Paul speaks of &ldquo;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us&rdquo; (1:19; 3:20). The words <em>surpassing greatness</em> and <em>superabundantly above</em> imply unlimitedness. The fellowship of Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon could transcend the limitations of time and space, because they touched infinity in their spirit. Finite man is mingled with the infinite God, such that what is finite becomes infinite and what is low becomes uplifted and strengthened. What a salvation!</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO LOSE THE SOUL BEING TO DENY THE SELF</h2>
<p>In order to experience death and resurrection, we must see that when the Lord was put to death on the cross, our soul-life, our old man, was crucified together with Him. Based on this seeing, we must deny the self. In addition to enlightening us, the Holy Spirit will work in our environment to break us. The most important step is for us to deny the self. Once we see that we are crucified with Christ, we must deny the self. To deny is to reject. This includes to detest, to condemn, to lose, and to forsake. Hence, to deny our self is to reject our mind, our emotion, and our will. When the Lord asked those who followed Him to deny the self, He was asking them to lose their soul-life (Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 9:24-25). This is the responsibility of every person who has received the revelation from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord likened Himself to a grain of wheat (John 12:24). In order for a grain of wheat to bear many grains, it must fall into the ground and die. The Lord was not forced to die, He died voluntarily: &ldquo;I lay down my life...No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself&rdquo; (10:17-18). After coming down from the Mount of Transfiguration, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51), that is, to go to the cross to die. Just as the Lord walked into death, we should do the same. If we are selfish, self-satisfied, self-contented, self-pitying, self-loving, or self-confident, we cannot be saved, because we will be unwilling to deny the self. Hence, we must not be selfish, self-satisfied, self-contented, self-pitying, self-loving, or self-confident.</p>
<p>It is right not to have many opinions, but this does not mean that we should be mindless persons. We must be full of thoughts, but we must be willing to forsake our thoughts. This is to deny the self, that is, to die. When we deny our self and condemn our natural life, we are accepting the principle of death. If we are always willing to deny our mind, emotion, will, inclinations, and opinions, we will be setting our face toward Jerusalem in order to accept the death of the cross. People in the world commit suicide, but Christians deny the self through the cross. This kind of self-denial is death.</p>
<p>Once we experience death, we will experience resurrection. Our responsibility is to deny the self, and the Lord&rsquo;s responsibility is to resurrect. This was the experience of the Lord. He walked into death, but God raised Him from the dead. When we reject and deny the self, God will resurrect us and change our nature. If we take the responsibility to enter into death, God will take the responsibility to resurrect our mind. When our mind enters into death and resurrection, its function is changed, and God&rsquo;s element is mingled with us. Formerly, our mind possessed only the thoughts of the self, but after death and resurrection our thoughts express the element of God; our limited humanity gains the unlimited God. Even simple believers become wise and can understand messages that educated people have difficulty understanding. Through such a fellowship God is mingled with man, and man is also mingled with God.</p>
<p>A lifeless pebble that is buried in the soil will not change. A seed, however, possesses life; hence, when it is buried in the soil, it dies, enters into resurrection, and its life is multiplied. Similarly, the more we deny the self, the more we will enter into resurrection and the richer our humanity will become, because we are mingled with God. Unbelievers are like pebbles. Hence, it does not make any difference whether or not they deny the self. However, as believers, we have the life of God; hence, we are like grains of wheat. The more we deny the self, the more we are in resurrection. The more we forsake our own love, the more we will love others. Formerly, our love was low and limited, but our love in resurrection is heavenly and unlimited.</p>
<p>Every genuine spiritual experience depends on forsaking the soul, losing the soul, and putting the soul-life to death. God&rsquo;s unique work in us is to transform us from being natural to being heavenly and from being void of His element to being full of His element.</p><h2 class="head1">DEPENDING ON GOD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
AND ENVIRONMENTAL AFFLICTIONS<br />
FOR THE SAVING OF OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>Although man has a spirit, he does not live in his spirit; rather, he lives in his soul. Before man fell, his spirit was an organ, a vessel, not his person. His soul was his person. When man is regenerated, God puts His Spirit with His life into man&rsquo;s spirit. Thus, man&rsquo;s spirit is not only enlivened but also regenerated. If man&rsquo;s spirit were merely made alive, it would not possess the divine life and element. Through regeneration, however, the divine life and element have been added to our spirit. God&rsquo;s life and nature are in our regenerated spirit. Now our regenerated spirit is our person. From the time of our regeneration, God works on our soul so that it will also be filled with His element.</p>
<p>When God works on our soul, He is working on our being. The Bible says that we need &ldquo;to be conformed to the image of His Son&rdquo; and to &ldquo;arrive...at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 8:29; Eph. 4:13). Being conformed to the image of the Son and arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ refer to our soul being full of God&rsquo;s element. After we are regenerated, our spirit is not a problem, but our soul is still a problem, because it lacks the element of God. Hence, God must continue to work in us so that His life can be wrought into and mingled with our soul. By the dispensing of God&rsquo;s life into us and the mingling of His life with us, we are conformed to the image of His Son. This is also the way for our soul to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is the way that Christ grows in us and is formed in us. These matters involve our soul.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, when we were regenerated, only our spirit, not our soul, was saved. After our regeneration our spirit contains God&rsquo;s life and element, but our soul is void of His life and element. Hence, the salvation of the soul comes later. James 1:21 says, &ldquo;Putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.&rdquo; James admonishes the believers to receive the word of God in meekness, because God&rsquo;s word can save their souls. The messages given in the churches should be for the saving of our souls.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:23 says, &ldquo;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; Regeneration here is a matter in the spirit. Chapter 2 says, &ldquo;Therefore putting away all malice...long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Salvation here is a matter of the soul. The milk of the word refers to God&rsquo;s word. Our regeneration is through the living and abiding word of God. After we are regenerated, we should long for the guileless milk of the word, that is, the word of God, so that we may grow unto the salvation of our soul. Milk is nourishment. We are regenerated when God&rsquo;s word is planted in us. After we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s word nourishes us in order for our soul to be saved. Hence, to grow unto salvation means that we need to grow in the divine life so that we may be saved. In other words, if we grow, we will be saved, but if we do not grow, we will not be saved in our soul. Salvation through growth is different from salvation through regeneration. The salvation that comes from growth is for the salvation of our soul.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:8-9 says, &ldquo;Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&rdquo; Verse 8 speaks of our situation when we were first saved, that is, the salvation of our spirit. Verse 9 speaks of the end of our faith, that is, the salvation of our soul. Hebrews 10:39 speaks of the &ldquo;gaining of the soul.&rdquo; This refers to the salvation of our soul after our regeneration. In verses 32 through 39 the apostle Paul charged the Hebrew believers to endure sufferings for the salvation of their souls. All the sufferings that we encounter after our salvation are for God&rsquo;s work in us. If we shrink back, we will nullify God&rsquo;s work in us and miss the reward from God (v. 35). For this reason, we have to endure sufferings in order for our soul to be saved. Furthermore, Luke 21:19 says, &ldquo;In your endurance you will possess your souls.&rdquo; Here the possessing of the soul is the salvation of the soul. This corresponds to Matthew 10:22, which says, &ldquo;He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the one hand, our soul is saved through the nurturing and nourishing of the word, on the other hand, our soul is saved through sufferings. In order for our soul to be saved, God must work in these two ways. The Lord&rsquo;s word instructs us and gives us revelation, thus causing us to see that our soul and everything related to our soul have been forsaken by God. Therefore, we must deny our soul, reject the self. This is the focus of the New Testament teachings. The Lord also raises up outward sufferings in our environment in coordination with the words that we hear. This means that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is in coordination with the nurturing of the word so that our soul may be put to death. In this way we practically experience the losing of our soul-life. When our soul dies, the resurrection life of God in our spirit has the opportunity to operate in our soul. Thus, God&rsquo;s element is dispensed into us. As a result, we will not have our own mind, emotion, or will. Through this process of death, the life in our spirit has the opportunity to spread into our soul, delivering our soul in resurrection from naturalness. This is also the way that we are transformed. Then our opinions contain God&rsquo;s element, and our proposals have His flavor. This is the salvation of our soul and our transformation. This is our death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL BEING<br />
A LIFE-LONG MATTER</h2>
<p>The saving of our soul is the unique work that God is doing in us after our regeneration. God&rsquo;s salvation involves three stages: the enlivening of our spirit at the time of our regeneration, the transformation of our soul, and the transfiguration of our body at the time of our rapture. In between the regeneration of our spirit and the rapture of our body is the process of the transformation of our soul. Likewise, our salvation has three stages. In the past we experienced the salvation of our spirit; in the future, at the Lord&rsquo;s return, we will experience the salvation of our body; and in the present we are experiencing the salvation of our soul. From the time that we were regenerated until the time that our body is redeemed and raptured, God&rsquo;s work in us is related to the salvation of our soul.</p>
<p>Every person who has been regenerated is saved in his spirit, and his body will be transfigured in the future. However, his problem is with the present. Although many believers dare not behave as they did prior to their salvation, there is little transformation in their soul. In other words, their soul has not experienced salvation. One day when they are enlightened and see that their soul has been put to death with the Lord on the cross, they will rise up to deny the self. Then they will begin to suffer the world&rsquo;s persecution because they will be different from the people in the world. Such an environment will be raised up by God for their soul to be saved through being put to death and entering into resurrection. A Christian who is merely saved in his spirit has not received complete salvation. It is still necessary for his soul to be saved and for his body to be raptured at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Only when his spirit, soul, and body are saved has he experienced God&rsquo;s complete salvation.</p></body></html>
