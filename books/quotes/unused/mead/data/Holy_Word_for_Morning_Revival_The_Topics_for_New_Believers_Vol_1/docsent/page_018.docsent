   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 Tim 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 5:39-40 You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible Being God's Breathing Out</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On God's side, the Scripture is His breathing out; on our side, it is for us to breathe in. God has already breathed out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible is God's breathing out, and to this day it is still God's breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, whenever you come to read the Bible, if you just read the dead letters and do not breathe in what God has breathed out, then the Bible will be dead letters to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Scripture is the breathing out of God, whereas our prayer is our breathing in. By this breathing out and breathing in, we breathe God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the meaning of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, no matter how much God breathes out, if we do not breathe in, we cannot receive God as our enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why many people come to the Bible but do not receive the life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words of the Bible are the breathing out of God, but when you turn them into prayer, they become your breathing in. What you breathe in is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord said that the words which He has spoken to us are spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's Word Being Our Food</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Holy Bible is the word of God, and we live on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the Bible also tells us that God's word is our food .In John 6:35 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" v. 57 . Because of His concern at that time that the disciples who listened to Him might not understand the meaning of His words, He added the words in verse 63, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." Therefore, you can see that the Lord's words are the food of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, it is necessary not only for the food to be prepared in the kitchen and set on the table; it is also necessary that you come to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do not eat, you will not get the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we all must learn to do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every good, living, and strong Christian must learn to do this one thing, that is, to eat the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>73</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible Being the Embodiment of the Lord Himself</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word in the Bible is not only the breath of God, the bread of life, and the word of God; it is also the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we touch the word, we must touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is short and even wrong to touch the word in the Bible and not touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus told the Jewish leaders, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" 5:39-40 . The word search in Greek means to research, to search and search again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus seemed to say, "I am one with the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are one with Me. If you come to the Scriptures, you have to come to Me. You have to make the Scriptures one with Me; instead, you have made the Scriptures something separate from Me. Therefore, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may gain knowledge in letters from the Scriptures, but you cannot have life because I am life."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two verses are a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible to come to the Bible yet not come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is possible to separate the Bible from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the time we have to take the Bible as one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we come to the Bible, we have to come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we read the Bible, we have to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible is not merely a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible is the embodiment of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>74</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
