He prepared a spirit within man that man might contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him by the way of taking God as his life. This is fully signified in the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). Eventually, God came to be a man. First, He created man; then He came to be a man in order to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, not in the position and rank of God. Then He went to die, and He resurrected. In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) that He might enter into our spirit to be one with us in this spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Now He is within us so that day by day we may live Him, express Him, and magnify Him by walking and doing everything according to the Spirit (Phil. 1:20-21; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16). This is wonderful, but still there is the need of something further: we need to grow. In order to grow, we need to know the way to grow and also the purpose for which we should grow.</P>
