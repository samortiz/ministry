<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Chien Sin-sien<br />on Her Journey</h2><p>To my beloved Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I greet you from my wandering journey. We have not yet been discharged. I left Hankow last year on December 27 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on January 6. I waited on the boat for several days while we were waiting for orders. We finally left for Siang-Tan on the morning of the tenth. We had to stay on the boat for several days because the director of the Hunan-Kweilin Railroad had gone to Hankow, so there was no one there to give orders. Yesterday, I was finally able to move to a hospital temporarily (one established by the China Inland Mission). Perhaps I will be assigned to work in the region of Kweilin, but nothing has been decided. The future is in God's sovereign hand. I was on a private boat on this journey, so there were many hidden dangers. Thank and praise our God, He preserved us and brought us safely through. My father and mother are in Soochow, and I still do not have any news of them. I do not know whether or not they are alive. When I think about it, my heart grieves! But then I think that perhaps it is the Lord's will that I experience Matthew 8:22. I only want God to gain something. I am willing to care for nothing and pass through what He wants me to go through. However, I am weak; I can only pray that God Himself keeps me. May God completely gain me so that I may glorify Him. We will probably be here for two weeks. We will notify you of our future itinerary. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Miss Chang for me. Sisters Chang, Tsou, Lin, and Lee all send their greetings.</p><p>From a weak little one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-sien<br />January 15</p><p>(This letter was sent from Hunan-Kweichow Railway Clinic of the Hwei Jing Hospital, Hsiang T'an.)</p><h2 class="head2">An Isolated Brother</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>I will begin by saying that I used to be a student of the arts. I did not believe in the Lord Jesus until 1931. After believing into the Lord, I dropped everything and became a full-time preacher. The X Church sent me to the X Seminary. Then I transferred to the X Seminary of the X denomination. Because of difficulties with a teacher, I was X from school and returned to my old home with the comforting of the Lord. I preached the gospel on the one hand and took up some jobs to maintain my living on the other. During that time, I gained the light of the truth and knew that what I believed was not complete and that my direction was in error. Therefore, I left the X denomination in a definite way. I am a loner by nature, but sometimes I thought that I did not have one real brother or sister by my side, and I felt sad. At the same time, I was too weak. It did not matter how hard I worked, there was never any fruit. Even my wife went the opposite direction from me. In these circumstances, I cried many times. It was probably Brother Liu Ai-wu in Ch'ang-sha who sent several copies of The Open Door to Brother Feng Hsien-luh in Ch'ang-Teh. Brother Feng passed on a copy to me. I wiped away the tears that were blurring my eyes after I read it. My heart was jumping for joy! Praise God! I know His good pleasure! He wanted to have a way (He has had it for some time now) to allow many of His lonely children to fellowship with one another. I am writing you joyfully to tell you and all the brothers and sisters that I am still here. I am pitiful, and I hope that you can come help me. My questions are: (1) If I am the only one here, how do I meet? (2) If I cannot eat the bread and drink the cup, what should I do? (3) I want to work, but how should I start? (4) How can I get in contact with brothers and sisters in other localities? I will only ask these four questions now. I will ask you the rest at another time. Peace.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Mei Han-ke<br />October 25, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Brother Han Fu-sheng is in Ch'ang-Teh. You can ask Brother Feng Hsien-luh to introduce you to him. It will be easy for him to answer your four questions&mdash;Editor.)</p>
