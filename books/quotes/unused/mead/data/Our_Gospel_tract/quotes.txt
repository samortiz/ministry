[1]  Before the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven, He charged His disciples to go forth and preach the gospel everywhere Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15 .
[2]  We, His believers, bear this burden joyfully, for God s power to save everyone who believes is contained in the gospel.
[3]  When He was on this earth, He was called the Lord Luke 2:11; Matt 3:3 because He is eternally God; and after He resurrected and ascended, He, as a man, was made Lord of all Acts 2:36 .
[4]  He will bring God s kingdom to this earth, and the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our God and of His Christ Rev 11:15; 12:10 .
