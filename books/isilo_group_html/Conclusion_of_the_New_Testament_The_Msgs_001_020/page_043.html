ENCOURAGEMENT</h2><p>In Romans 15:5 God is called the God of encouragement. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 1:3 says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement.&#8221; Encouragement, as an attribute of God, is slightly different from comfort and consolation. The Greek word rendered encouragement in 2 Corinthians 1:3 has the sense of cheered. Encouragement is related to hope. If we have hope, we shall have encouragement.<p>Paul experienced God as the God of all encouragement. In 2 Corinthians 1:4 he testifies that the God of encouragement &#8220;encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.&#8221; First we need to experience the encouragement of God. Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God. Hence, we are encouraged so that we may be able to encourage others. This requires experience.<h2 class=head1>V. KINDNESS</h2><p>The New Testament reveals the divine attribute of kindness. Romans 2:4 says, &#8220;Do you despise the riches of His kindness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?&#8221; Romans 11:22, speaking of the kindness of God and His severity, emphasizes the attribute of God&#8217;s kindness. Furthermore, Ephesians 2:7 declares, &#8220;That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Kindness is a benevolent goodness which issues out of mercy and love. It is in such kindness that the grace of God is given to us. Titus 3:4-5 says, &#8220;When the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared,...He saved us.&#8221; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.<h2 class=head1>W. FORBEARANCE</h2><p>Regarding the way God deals with sinners, Romans 2:4 refers to His excellent attribute of forbearance. God forbears with fallen man for a purpose. His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy. If God did not show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy.<p>The Bible reveals that in His economy God has exercised great forbearance. Immediately after the fall of man, God began to show forbearance in His dealings with man. If you read Genesis 3 from the viewpoint of forbearance, you will see how forbearing God was with fallen man. God exercised His understanding, fully realizing man&#8217;s situation and need. God also exercised His wisdom to deal with fallen man.<p>For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance. With His forbearance, it is full of understanding, wisdom, patience, consideration, sympathy, mercy, kindness, love, and grace. Even the rich supply of life is included in God&#8217;s forbearance. God never commands us to do anything without considering our need and granting us His supply. God&#8217;s forbearance always includes His adequate supply to meet our need.<p>God dealt with different people in different ways. He dealt with Adam in one way, with Abel in another way, and with Cain in yet another way. In this we see God&#8217;s forbearance.<p>In the Scriptures there are different dispensations, different ways, God deals with man. These dispensations are actually related to forbearance. For God to deal with people in a particular way during a certain age is for Him to show forbearance.<p>God makes known His forbearance by dealing with us in a way that is reasonable, suitable, and considerate. God never disciplines anyone without proper consideration. He often waits a long period of time before chastising someone. God certainly is forbearing in dealing with us.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 001-020) &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
