The fact that the Lord is in the heavens sitting down at the right hand of God means that He has done everything that He had to do
We think that because Christ is God or because He is the Creator, He is automatically the Lord of the universe
We need to realize that the matter of Christ being the Lord is something very different from our natural concept
The apostle Paul also tells us that God 'subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things'
All things are under His feet, and everything that He has obtained and attained is being transmitted to the church, which is His Body
The first fact is that Christ's ascension indicated the complete accomplishment of the redemptive work of Christ
Everything that needed to be done for the accomplishing of redemption has already been done and Christs lordship has been fully established
The first main point is the ascension of Christ; the second main point is the position of the church as the Body of Christ
After His resurrection the Lord told the disciples that all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to Him
On August 10, 1945, the Japanese army declared their willingness to surrender to the Allied forces in World War II
Before that day China had been under Japanese occupation, and many of the Chinese people had been treated very badly
By living in the Body and putting on the new man, we will be able to exercise the authority given to the Body by the Head
For two thousand years these matters have been neglected, but we believe that in these last days the Lord is going to recover them
To ask is to be at some distance from the Lord, to seek is to go toward the Lord, and to knock is to arrive at the presence of the Lord
When we are seeking, the Lord will still not be satisfied; consequently, He will continue to withhold the answer to our prayer
