   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We are the representatives of God in this world, and we are here to prove His faithfulness; therefore, above all in financial matters we must be totally independent of men, and wholly dependent upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our attitude, our words, and our actions must all declare that He alone is our source of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there is any weakness here, He will be robbed of the glory that is His due.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God's servants, we must show forth the abundant resources of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must not be afraid to appear wealthy before people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must never be untrue, but such an attitude is perfectly consistent with honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us keep our financial needs secret, even if our secrecy should lead men to conclude that we are well off when we have nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who sees in secret will take note of all our needs, and He will meet them, not in stinted measure, but "according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus" Phil 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We dare to make things difficult for God, because He requires no assistance from us in order to perform His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the study of God's Word we note two things concerning the attitude of His children to financial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, workers should be careful to disclose their needs to none but God; on the other hand, the churches should be faithful in remembering the needs both of the workers and their work, and they should not only send gifts to those who are working in their vicinity, or to those who have been called out from their midst, but, like the Philippians and the Macedonians, they should frequently minister to a far-off Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The horizon of the churches should be much wider than it is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The present method of a church supporting its own "minister" or its own missionary was a thing unknown in apostolic days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If, with the present-day facilities for transmitting money to distant parts, the children of God only minister to the material needs of those in their own locality, they certainly lack spiritual insight and largeness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the part of the workers there must be no expectation from man, and on the part of the churches there should be a faithful remembrance of the work and the workers both at home and abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is essential to the spiritual life of the churches that they take a practical interest in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has no use for an unbelieving worker, nor has He any use for a loveless church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The distinction between the church and the work must be clearly defined in the mind of the worker, especially as regards financial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should a worker pay a short visit to any place on the invitation of the church, then it is quite right for him to receive their hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But should he stay for an indefinite period, then he must bear the burden alone before God; otherwise, his faith in God will wane.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even should a brother willingly offer free hospitality, it ought to be declined, for the life of faith must be carefully maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is right for the brethren to give occasional gifts to the workers, as the Philippians did to Paul, but they must not bear the responsibility of any.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The churches have no official obligations regarding the workers, and the latter must see to it that the former do not take such obligations upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God permits us to accept gifts, but it is not His will that others become responsible for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gifts of love may be sent to the workers from their brethren in the Lord, but no believers must regard themselves as under any legal obligations towards them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only have the churches no official responsibility towards the workers; they are not even responsible for their board, lodgings, or traveling expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire financial responsibility of the work rests upon those to whom it has been committed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one" 2 Cor 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"I will not be a burden" 2 Cor 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"For neither were we found at any time with flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness; God is witness" 1 Thes 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Nor did we eat bread as a gift from anyone, but in labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be burdensome to any of you" 2 Thes 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From these passages we see clearly the attitude of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was not willing to impose any burden upon others or in any way to take advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And this must be our attitude too.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only should we receive no salary, we should be careful not to take the slightest advantage of any of our brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apostles should be willing to be taken advantage of, but on no account should they ever take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a shameful thing to profess trust in God and yet play the role of a pauper, disclosing one's needs and provoking others to pity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A servant of God who really sees the glory of God, and his own glorious position as one of His workmen, can well afford to be independent of others, and even liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is only right for us to enjoy the hospitality of our brethren for awhile, but we should most rigidly guard against taking advantage of them in trifles such as a night's lodging, an odd meal, or the use of light and coal, or of household utensils, or even of a daily paper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing reveals smallness of character so readily as taking petty advantages.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not careful in such matters, we may as well relinquish our task.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the movements of workers vitally affect the work, and unless we have a living trust in God, our movements are liable to be determined by prospective incomes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Money has great power to influence men, and unless we have true faith in God and a true heart to do His will, we are likely to be influenced by the rise and fall of funds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our movements are governed by financial supplies, then we are hirelings working for pay, or beggars seeking alms, and we are a disgrace to the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should never go to a place because of the bright financial prospects of working there, nor should we refrain from going because the financial outlook is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all our movements we must ask ourselves, Am I in the will of God? or am I influenced at all by financial considerations?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are out to serve the Lord, not to make a living.</S>
