The general subject of this book is the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation
During our time with the Lord in the morning, we experience economy, but later in the day we may experience chaos
The entire Bible from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation is a record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos
In order to understand the divine economy and the satanic chaos, we need to see the difference between the old creation and the new creation
Galatians 6:15 says, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into all His believers, who were the old creation, to make them something new
Our becoming a new creation in Christ began with our regeneration, and it continues with our being sanctified, renewed, and transformed
As believers in Christ, we are now in the third age, the age of grace, expecting to enter into the age of the kingdom
The end of the satanic chaos will be the lake of fire, and the consummation of the divine economy will be the New Jerusalem
We need to realize that, both in the Bible and in our experience, the satanic chaos always goes along with the divine economy
Job 38:7 indicates that the angels sang and rejoiced when they saw the beautiful universe which God had created
The universe became a chaos under God's judgment: the heavens became dark, and the earth became waste and void
Because Satan's rebellion polluted not only the earth but also the heavens, both the earth and the heavens were judged by God
In the restored universe, God then created man to express Him in His image and to represent Him in His dominion
God created man in His image so that man could express Him, and He gave man dominion so that man could represent Him
The satanic chaos in the old creation began with Satan as the serpent tempting man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In the divine economy in the fall of man, God also promised to let man have life and provided man with covering
God promised that one would come to destroy the serpent, and He promised to give the divine life to fallen man
In His restoration of creation, God purposely created a garden of pleasure, which was called the garden of Eden
The entrance would remain closed until Christ came to accomplish redemption and thus open again the way to the tree of life
In the further steps and consummation of man's fall, we see more aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos
Of offering something of the flock, typifying Christ, he offered the result of his own labor, and that offended God
With him there were both good and evil, indicating that he surely belonged to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In the further steps of the fall, man became flesh and man's sin became great, so man was judged by God with the flood
Genesis 11:31 and 12:4 tell us that God called Abraham out of the land of idolatry and brought him into the land of His promise
As the seed of woman, the seed of Mary, Christ has accomplished redemption to defeat and destroy Satan and to deal with our sin and sins
Their erecting a tent indicates that they never became settled on earth but instead were a traveling people, strangers to the earth
By means of the Passover with the killing of the lamb and the striking of the blood, they passed through God's judgment
After the people of Israel passed through God's judgment and made their exodus from Egypt, they became a people traveling in the wilderness
The people of Israel had become blessed travelers with God, but they were overconfident in themselves for the keeping of God's commandments
Being overconfident in themselves and not knowing themselves, they said, 'All that the Lord hath spoken we will do'
What the people of Israel spoke was entirely different and was offensive to God, who then proceeded to decree the law
In the wilderness the people of Israel sidetracked themselves from the central line of the divine economy to the sideline of the law
Finally, let us consider the remaining aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old Testament
Even in the Old Testament, God's people did not live only by the law but also through the tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings
David surely was not perfect according to the law, but he was perfect according to the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings
After he confessed his sins of murder and fornication, he applied the offering , and through the offering he was forgiven
Through Christ as the tabernacle, the Priest, and the offerings, we sinners have been redeemed, saved, and regenerated
According to Gods economy we will also be renewed sanctified transformed conformed to Christs image and glorified with Him in His glory
David desired to build the temple for God and he prepared the material and the site for the building of God's temple
Absalom, one of his sons, killed another of the sons and then rebelled against David and even sought to kill him
The decline of the kings the corruption of the priests the falsehood of the prophets and the evils of the people of Israel were intolerable
Eventually, Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the people of Israel were captured by the Babylonians
They should have been excited and diligent to build the temple, but instead they became idle, forgetting the rebuilding of the temple
Christ has come to initiate the New Testament economy, and He is coming to consummate the New Testament economy
God came in to select a person by the name of Abraham and decided to make his descendants a new race, the chosen race
The entire Bible from the second half of Genesis 11 to the end of the New Testament is occupied with this elect race
As we read through the Old Testament to the end, we see that the children of Israel, the race of Abraham, utterly failed God
Verse 2 goes on to say that Abraham begot Isaac, that Isaac begot Jacob, and that Jacob begot Judah and his brothers
When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him
From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us
The list of what came with Christ even includes us who believe in Christ, for as believers we are descendants of Abraham
When God selected Abraham, He decided to give him two kinds of descendants the physical descendants and the spiritual descendants
Abraham's physical descendants are the physical Israel, and his spiritual descendants are the spiritual Israel
In order that we may have full confidence concerning this, let us now consider some verses from the book of Galatians
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus
Now we, all the believers in Christ white, black, yellow, brown, and red are of the same race, the Abrahamic race
Verse 10 says So then as we have the opportunity let us do what is good toward all but especially toward those of the household of the faith
No matter what our color may be, we all have faith, and we all are members of the household of the faith, members of the same family
Whereas in verse 10 we have the household of the faith, in verses 15 and 16 we have the new creation and the Israel of God
Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the household of the faith, a new creation, and a part of the Israel of God
In a sense the church life may be a kind of paradise, but this does not mean that there will never be turmoil in the church
In the thirty years that the Lord's recovery has been in the United States, we have seen turmoil after turmoil, chaos after chaos
The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt
Certain of those who were once on the inside have caused turmoil, saying falsely that, since 1984, the recovery has changed in nature
Concerning Christ and His ministry, the New Testament reveals that there were both the divine economy and the satanic chaos
In His ministry Christ taught the kingdom, proclaimed the gospel, and healed all kinds of diseases, attracting a great crowd to follow Him
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
While the Lord Jesus was expecting soon to be crucified, His followers were fighting with one another about who would be first among them
They had heard many things about the heavenly kingdom, but instead of caring about those things, they cared about being great
That certainly was something of the satanic chaos, but eventually the outcome of that chaos was something very good
Whereas Peter and the other disciples forsook the Lord, the women followed Him from Gethsemane and eventually watched His crucifixion
Peter preached at Pentecost, and three thousand repented, believed, and were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
The believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers
According to the record in the book of Acts, the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly
Again the satanic chaos was unavoidable and went along with the divine economy in the ministry of the apostles
In Acts 5:1-11 Ananias, a brother, and his wife Sapphira deceived the Spirit and were punished to death in the presence of the church
Both at Paul's time and today, there were different teachings, teachings other than the divine economy taught by Paul
Without this chaos we would not have the books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus
Deep truths concerning the church life, the Christian life, and God's economy with the divine dispensing are in these books
Some, as Hymenaeus and Alexander, thrust away faith and a good conscience and became shipwrecked regarding the faith
Hymenaeus and Alexander must have been leading ones, prominent ones in the churches, yet they had a very serious change
Some, as Hymenaeus and Philetus, misaimed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection had already taken place
Saying that the resurrection had already taken place was a serious heresy that denied the divine power in life
Such ones were heretics, and John told us to quarantine them and not to invite them into our homes or to greet them
Some went in the way of Cain, rushed out in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah
The stories concerning Cain, Balaam, and Korah were repeated in the church life, and this repetition brought chaos into the church
Far in this message we have covered almost the entire New Testament regarding the divine economy and the satanic chaos
The satanic chaos will end with the termination of the evil Satan, the old creation, and all the negative things in the lake of fire
The divine economy will be consummated, not ended, with the processed Triune God, the new creation, and the holy city of living water
We have emphasized the fact that the satanic chaos is in the old creation and that the divine economy is for the new creation
As we are in the church life as the process of Christ's coming, we should not be troubled by any kind of chaos
God's dealing with the Abrahamic race occupies nearly the entire Old Testament, from partway through Genesis 11 to the end of Malachi
The book of Genesis tells us that Abraham had two kinds of descendants, who were likened to the dust of the earth and the stars of heaven
Humanly speaking, it is quite disappointing, but divinely speaking, our God can never be shaken or disappointed
Because He is such a One, He produces another race, the top race, the super race, the race above all the races
What the Lord needs is the race of overcomers to conquer all the satanic chaos and triumph in the divine economy
We must be in the last nineteen chapters of the Bible, from Revelation 4 through 22, from the throne to the New Jerusalem
If someone were to ask us what kind of people we are, we should be able to say, 'I belong to a race of which you do not know
The second church, Smyrna, was very good, but the persecution the saints suffered under the earthly empire was severe
Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, so he changed his strategy
Through Constantine's encouragement and political influence the church was married to the Roman Empire, that is, to the world
With the worldly church, different teachings came in such as the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans
The Roman Catholic Church is typified by the woman Jezebel a selfappointed prophetess who presumed to be authorized by God to speak for God
Those in Roman Catholicism follow what the pope says, what the church says, not what the Bible says, what the Lord says
According to Revelation 2 and 3, the Catholic Church is devilish, satanic, and heretical, and the Protestant churches are dying and dead
It is a statistical fact that many of the main line denominations are having very little increase and are even losing their members
By looking at the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, we can see the chaos in the practical situation of today's church
The first horse signifies the gospel, the second horse signifies war, the third horse signifies famine, and the fourth horse signifies death
The preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death have been running on this earth for close to two thousand years
These wars have caused the shortage of food, and war with the shortage of food have issued in disease and death
These martyrs cried out, 'How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth'?
The seventh seal, the entire contents of the seven trumpets , includes the supernatural calamities of the first four trumpets
In the seventh trumpet of the seventh seal there will be the war at Armageddon where Antichrist with all his armies will be defeated
The material Babylon, the city of Rome, will be fallen, destroyed by God , at the end of the great tribulation
Revelation 19 also tells us that the overcoming Christ will come down from the heavens to the earth with His armies
After the destruction of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years
We will then be God's tabernacle for God to lodge in and enjoy us , and God will be the temple for us to lodge in and enjoy Him
Now that we have received an overview of the book of Revelation, we need to consider where we are and who we are
The New Jerusalem in eternity includes the overcomers and all the dear saints whom God perfected during the thousand-year kingdom
They are underneath the earth in Paradise, crying out, at the fifth seal near the end of this age, for the Lord to avenge them
The third group of overcomers is the hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers, the firstfruits, in Revelation 14:1-5
In the air the Lord will rapture the majority of the saints , and all the believers will stand before the judgment seat of Christ
After these thousand years are completed, the old heaven and old earth will pass away and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth
The new creation came into being through the divine economy, and the divine economy will be consummated by the overcomers
In those thousand years, God will discipline all those who have believed in the Lord Jesus but have been defeated and are not matured
If we are not matured in this age, God has a way to make us mature in the next age, but that way to be matured is the hard way
Hebrews 11 lists a number of these overcomers from the Adamic race and from the Abrahamic race according to the flesh
In order to be the overcomers, we must conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy
If we are enabled by the Lord to conquer all the destructive chaos, we will triumphantly enter into the kingdom
Those who make divisions like to contact the saints, and this contact causes the saints to be stumbled and leave the church life
We will be cold about attending the church meetings and about reading the Recovery Version with the Life-study Messages
In the Life-study of Second Timothy, we pointed out that the subject of this book is the inoculation against the decline of the church
The rebellious ones cannot shake the church in the Lord's recovery, because the church is the pillar and base of the truth
Revelation 2 and 3 reveal that we need to conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy in certain conditions
We also need to enjoy eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise so that we can be a shining lampstand
We should eat one tree, the universal tree, the unique tree, that is, the tree of life, which is Christ as the embodiment of the divine life
Today the church life is the precursor of this coming paradise, the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom
The Lord exhorted the church in Smyrna to be faithful unto death in suffering poverty and trial for the crown of life
The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication
In the religious organization of the Roman Catholic Church there are the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and eventually the pope
The teaching of the Nicolaitans is that only the clergy are qualified and positioned to preach, to speak for the Lord
When we are transformed into a white stone, this means that we are justified and approved by the Lord for His building
To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord
For all of these points concerning the overcomers it would be helpful to study Revelation 2 and 3 with all the notes in the Recovery Version
We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age
To have a proper view of the Lord's present move in Russia, we also need to understand God's economy concerning the human race
In Genesis 1 God made man in His image and after His likeness so that man could express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion
Genesis later tells us that when Noah came out of the flood he built an altar to serve God, and that pleased God
The Jewish land of Palestine is in the center of these three inhabited sections Europe to the north Africa to the south and Asia to the east
About five hundred years ago, Columbus ventured to sail across the Atlantic, and he reached a new land, America
The majority of the people in the United States are the descendants of the Europeans, who are the descendants of Japheth
Nimrod was the builder of these two great nations Assyria with Nineveh as the capital and Babylon with the city of Babel as the capital
Babylon followed Assyria to conquer Israel, to destroy Jerusalem, to burn the temple, and to exile all the children of Israel
They are fighting with each other and are still making trouble in the region of the world around the Mediterranean Sea
If we read history carefully, we can see that God in carrying out His economy always went through the strong people
Their spreading of the gospel was facilitated by the Roman highways on land and by the Roman means of sailing on the seas
On the one hand, the strong nation of Rome persecuted and even crucified Christ, and also persecuted and martyred the apostles
It was through this strong empire that the way was prepared for Christ to be born and crucified and for the gospel to be preached
Imperialism is the policy and practice of maintaining an empire through the conquest and domination of weaker countries
To the east of Europe there is the Russian commonwealth, which also numbers about three hundred fifty million people
It was a miracle for us to baptize over five thousand people with only a little over thirty saints as baptizers
After baptizing all of these new believers, they have to go to their homes to have the home meetings to nourish them
The people of Russia have been prepared by the Lord, and if we do not go to them now, we will miss the opportunity
Their minds have been emptied and they are now open, but after another five years their minds could become filled up again
Today in the Russian alphabet, there are a number of Greek letters because some Greek missionaries made an alphabet for the people of Russia
Before his time, Russia was basically an oriental culture in things such as their way of dress and in their eating
History tells us that eventually the royal family of Russia the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church and the landlords all became corrupted
The leading ones have to consider who is more useful here at home and who is more useful for the migration to Russia
We have to realize that the amount of offerings will not increase unless the Lord comes in to perform some miracle
When Abraham was called by God, God told him that his seed would be as the dust of the earth and as the stars of heaven
In Galatians 6:16 Paul refers to the spiritual descendants of Abraham in a collective way as the Israel of God
The spiritual descendants of Abraham as the spiritual, heavenly Israel have now occupied almost two thousand years also
Because we are near the end of this six thousand year period of time, we are at the threshold of the manifestation of the kingdom
During this period of time, God's enemy, Satan, has done all that he can to frustrate the carrying out of God's economy
Job 1:6 says, 'Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them'
The divine economy and the satanic chaos can be seen from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation
For eternity there will be two things a city of water and a lake of fire, signifying God's economy and Satan's chaos
In Ephesians 6 Paul told us that we need to be empowered in the Lord to stand against the stratagems of the devil
He said, 'Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
We have seen that the church, due to its degradation, eventually became married to the world during the time of Constantine
Eventually, in the sixteenth century, Martin Luther rose up, and the Lord used him to recover the truth concerning justification by faith
The private churches were formed, such as the Presbyterian church, the Baptist church, and the Methodist church
In the eighteenth century, the Lord used Zinzendorf to recover something of the practice of the proper church life
In the nineteenth century, the Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby went on to recover the church life in a further way
That forced the Lord to go to China, which Brother Nee said was 'virgin soil' for the Lord to have a new start of the church life
God's economy has passed through the Adamic race and also through the Abrahamic race, both physically and spiritually
The divine revelation was fully completed in the first century with Paul's ministry and John's mending ministry
Revelation 2 and 3 show that the Lord wants us to conquer three things: Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
We also have to conquer three kinds of teachings: the teaching of Balaam , the teaching of the Nicolaitans , and the teaching of Jezebel
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, these are three other teachings besides the apostles' teaching
If we are going to be an overcoming believer, we have to conquer the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans
Alexander Hislop in his book The Two Babylons exposes the origin of the evil demonic pagan things that were brought into the apostate church
The book of Revelation tells us that Antichrist will destroy all religions at the beginning of the great tribulation
In 1937 Brother Watchman Nee saw the need to have the church meeting in mutuality as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14
At that time, however, we could not find a way to replace the one man speaking service in the Lord's Day morning meeting
It is not a small matter to give up the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening, the practice of the Lord's Day message meeting
In order to push away the clergylaity system the system of one man speaking and the rest listening we must be those who speak for the Lord
If we come to the Lord's Day meeting in a neutral way without the intention to speak for the Lord, we are contributing to this system
Our silence, our not functioning, our not opening up our mouths to speak in the meeting, is what constitutes the system of one man speaking
The more we exercise to speak for the Lord in the meetings, the higher the meetings are to us and the more we love the meetings
The Lord is pleased with our speaking because we are conquering and annulling the destructive chaos by our speaking
Christ, the preeminent One, is a living, organic person, and the Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization
If we want the church to be living, we should not come to the meetings and sit in our chair the entire time to merely listen to others
Ephesians 3:18 speaks of our apprehending the universal dimensions of Christ the breadth and length and height and depth
When the cup is filled with water to the extent that it is overflowing, this overflow of water is the expression
Our meetings should not be full of silence but full of the divine speaking for the exhibition of Christ, the expression of Christ
Doctrines such as head covering, foot washing, and methods of baptism are doctrines, but not the truth which we need to teach
The church as the pillar and base of the truth is the manifestation of God in the flesh, and this is the great mystery of godliness
Eventually, the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem
The overcomers will be there as the co-kings of Christ in the heavenly part of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
In chapters one and two, we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in both the Old Testament and the New Testament
In order to be the overcomers, we need to cooperate with the Lord to speak Him forth for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
After seeing the revelation concerning the overcomers, we saw the truth concerning God's economy in chapter four
The practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church
When we say that we are the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, this is not a name but a description of a fact
Once in the Far East, someone was so impressed with the United States that he said even the moon was bigger there
When the moon appears in London, it is the moon in London; when it appears in Los Angeles, it is the moon in Los Angeles
Just as there is the moon in Los Angeles and the moon in London, there is the church in Los Angeles and the church in London
There is an Anglican church, an Episcopalian church, in Anaheim, and there are churches representing Taiwan in Anaheim
They may ask, 'Since you all have the same Christ and read the same Bible, why are there so many different denominations'?
There were a number of missionaries in Chefoo at that time, and they were surprised that my preaching was attracting so many people
They were also concerned about my speaking regarding the church being one and the denominations being divisions
Once we are denominated, we become a division, and division in the Body of Christ is abominable in the eyes of the Lord'
Today's Christianity is full of organization, but the church as the living Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God
According to Revelation 3:1 the church in Sardis as a prefigure of the Protestant church has a name that she is living, but she is dead
In a sense, all the denominations take away the saints' first civil right because of their clergy-laity system
When we exercise our civil right to speak for the Lord, we should not exercise it in a wild way but in a proper way
In 1 Corinthians 14:40 Paul says that in the church meetings, 'all things must be done becomingly and in order'
It is all right for the young people to make a joyful noise for a short period of time, but this should not be prolonged
We may think that when we are orderly, we cannot be excited and that when we are excited, we cannot be orderly
If the young people are functioning too much, the older saints should have the realization that it is now their turn to function
If we do not live Christ and magnify Christ in our daily life, we are not practical members of a practical church
We must show even the angels, the demons, and the evil spirits that we are a people who live Christ to magnify Him
In order to live and magnify Christ for the church life in God's economy, we also need to pursue and gain Christ
We need to be those who desire to gain Christ to such an extent that we would lay hold of Him, not letting Him get away from us
Living and magnifying Christ is the first condition, first term, first requirement, for us to live the church life in God's economy
God's intention is to have one corporate Body composed of all the saved ones and constituted with the transformed believers
We should not only keep the oneness among the saints in our locality, our region, or even merely in the United States
In a sense, we may say that a local church is autonomous in business affairs, but no local church is absolutely autonomous
If a legal case cannot be decided at the local or state levels, it goes to the Supreme Court at the federal level
If we are not the gifted ones we are the parts who should operate according to our measure for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
When we rise up to speak for the Lord, we have the moving of the Spirit within us, and that moving is the dispensing
The local churches standing on the ground of oneness are the local expressions of the unique, universal Body of Christ
They may go further to tell people that after they are saved, they should conduct themselves in an upright way to glorify the Father
For the church life in God's economy, we need to meet and serve in mutuality according to the God-ordained way
Our meetings should be in mutuality with all the saints of different ages functioning for the building up of the church
To meet and serve according to God's ordained way is first to fulfill the New Testament gospel priesthood for begetting
It is for begetting sinners to make them the sons of God, the brothers of Christ, and the members of Christ to constitute Christ's Body
The new believers who have been begotten through our preaching of the gospel need to be nourished and cherished in home meetings
Finally, we need to prophesy in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ through the local churches
We need to learn to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord in order to minister Christ to people
If we all exercise our spirit in the meetings to prophesy, we will have living, fresh, uplifted, and rich meetings
