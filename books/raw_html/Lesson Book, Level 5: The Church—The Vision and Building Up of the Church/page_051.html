<h2 class=head3>2. Elders as Overseers Appointed in These Churches by the Spirit</h2><p>[Elders as overseers were appointed in these churches by the Spirit (Acts 20:17, 28). To the elders of the church in Ephesus Paul said, “Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers’’ (Acts 20:28a). It was the apostles who appointed the elders in every church. But here Paul, the leading one who did the appointing, says that the Holy Spirit did it. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing the elders and that the apostles had done this according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.]<p>[This reveals that a local church comes into existence only through the work of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit establishes the elders, it is the Holy Spirit who establishes the churches.<p>The overseers in Acts 20:28 are the elders in verse 17. This proves that overseers and elders are synonymous terms denoting the same persons.]<p>[The Greek word for “overseer’’ is episkopos, from epi, meaning “over,” and skopos, meaning “seer,” hence, “overseer” (“bishop,” from Latin episcopus). An overseer (1 Tim. 3:2) in a local church is an elder. The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This teaching is also the source of the Episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the sight of God.]<h2 class=head2>G. Reaching Europe— Churches Raised Up in the Province of Macedonia</h2><p>[The spreading of the churches continued and eventually reached Europe. Churches were raised up in the province of Macedonia, and in 2 Corinthians 8:1 Paul speaks of “the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia.’’ Macedonia is a province of the Roman Empire in southeastern Europe between Thrace and Achaia on the Aegean Sea.]<h2 class=head3>1. The Church in Philippi, Comprising the Saints with the Overseers and Deacons</h2><p>[A church was established in Philippi, comprising the saints with the overseers and deacons. In Philippians 1:1 Paul says, “Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.’’ This verse indicates that the church in Philippi was established in good order. Notice that Paul speaks of the “saints…with the overseers and deacons.’’ This is the only place in the New Testament where such an expression is found. It is significant that Paul speaks of the saints with the overseers and deacons. In every local church the unique group consists of the saints. The saints are the components of a local church. Among the saints there are leading ones, which the New Testament describes as elders or overseers. Both titles refer to the same people. When an elder is carrying out his responsibility in the church, he is functioning as an overseer.<p>In 1:1 Paul also mentions the deacons. Deacons are the serving ones in a local church under the direction of the overseers (l Tim. 3:8). The English word “deacons” is an anglicized form of the Greek word diakonos, which means a serving one.]
