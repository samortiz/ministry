   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>24-30, 36-43 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A mustard seed is an herb to produce food, but in this parable it grows into a tree, a lodge for birds, that is, for evil persons and things.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third parable is the parable of the leaven v. 33 , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Bread which is leavened is easier to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Bible truths concerning Christ have been leavened by Christendom.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second blue circle on the chart is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the third aspect of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To see these three aspects the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation will help us to understand the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The purposes in God's creation of man can be seen in Genesis 1:26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that God's intention was to express Himself through the man He had created.</S>
