   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Gates for Communication and Entrance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 12, 13, and 21 speak of the gates of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We thank the Lord that in the holy city there is not only a wall but also twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The wall is for separation and protection, while the gates are for communication and entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there were no gates, how could people enter in?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need a wall with gates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A gate is a break, an opening, in a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, we need to build up the wall, but on the other hand, we need breaking to create an entrance into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we sense that a dear brother has a strong wall without any gates.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one can enter in through him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have seen this kind of spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more spiritual they become, the more they are not able to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They cannot beget spiritual children because they have a wall with no entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need a breaking in order to reach out to others that they may enter in through us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many dear Christians have no wall at all; they are too open.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But other spiritual ones have a wall with no openings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need the wall, and we need twelve gates, three gates in each of the four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How many gates do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can people be saved and enter into the church through us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some local churches have a wall without gates, so there is no way for people to enter in. If anyone wants to be saved and come into the church, it seems that they have to climb over the spiritual persons, that they must be holy and spiritual before they can enter in. Do we want this kind of Christian life and church life? The wall in our Christian life and church life must have adequate entrances in four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then no matter what direction people come from, there is an entrance for them to get in. We say that we are not sectarian or exclusive, but where are our entrances? Do we have twelve gates toward creation in four directions?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In each direction, no matter where people come from, there must be an entrance for them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The gates are toward the Far East in the east, Africa and South America in the south, and Europe to the west.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is even an entrance for the Russian Bolsheviks from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entrances are toward all directions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entrances are also toward all classes of people, whether they are doctors or gamblers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are twelve gates in four directions for people to enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That there are three gates on each side signifies that the three of the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit work together to bring people into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is indicated in the three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Son as the shepherd came to die for us to bring us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit as the seeking woman enlightens our heart to cause us to repent, to make a decision to come back to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the loving Father receives the returning prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The three parables in Luke 15 show us the three steps taken by the Triune God to bring fallen man back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our Christian life and church life, we must have the separating wall of the holiness and appearance of God in His glory, but our separation must provide adequate entrances for people to contact us and enter in. We need the breaking to create openings in the wall, which are the Triune God as the three gates in four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In some places the saints have asked me for the way to bring people into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way is to have more breaking to create the openings, not by human hands but by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This breaking is accomplished by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider from Luke 15 how the Son came to sacrifice His life to bring us back to God, how the Spirit diligently enlightens the darkened heart, and how the Father loves the fallen sinners and awaits their return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are willing for the Triune God to break us to create the openings, many people will be brought into the church life through us because the entrances, the gates, will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be too spiritual and boast that we are separated, holy, and not worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are this way, then we may want to see people saved, but they will not come; we may distribute tracts, but there will be no response.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that we are still too whole.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should fall down, prostrate ourselves, and cry to the Lord, I do not care about my spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I would rather see people be saved and helped by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do this, the gates will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When our spirituality is broken, there are the gates, the openings and entrances, for the weak and sinful ones to come through.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there is no need for them to use their own effort to climb over the high wall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to build up the wall, but we must not build up a wall that is whole, without entrances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being Balanced in Every Aspect and on Every Side</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is too easy for us to go to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, we may have no wall at all, but on the other hand, we may build a wall without entrances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may have no desire to reach others for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may prefer to stay within the wall and exclude others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hosea 7:8 speaks of a cake not turned, a cake burned on one side and raw on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be turned again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must build the wall, but there must be the breaking and cutting to create gates in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some Christians need to build the wall higher, but those who have built the wall need breaking to create gates for people to enter through.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To build three gates on each of four sides will balance us and balance the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to construct a building with three gates on four sides, it must be erected at the center of the lot.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If it were built on a corner of the lot, it could not have gates on all four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For a building to have three gates on each of its four sides is the best way to position it in the center of the lot and keep it balanced in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may be a very good church, but we may be a church in the corner ; we may not have gates on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that we are not balanced; we have slipped toward a corner and have gone to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A building with three gates on four sides, one that is easy for people to come into, must be adequately balanced and properly in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The New Jerusalem as the building of God is the very center of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In every aspect and from every side it is one hundred percent balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is neither too much to one side nor too much to another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The local expression of the church in the city where we live must also be in the center, not geographically but spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It must not go too far in any direction, leaving only one or two sides with entrances.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church must be very balanced in every aspect and appear the same from every side.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It must not be in any extreme but in the very center of God s testimony, having four sides full of gates for people to enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The messages in this book are not a mere study of the prophecies of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, I have a strong burden to tell you that to have twelve gates will keep us balanced and make us the very center of God s universe.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may be delivered from any unbalanced position and kept in the very center, balanced in every way and aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May we learn these lessons and apply them to our daily life, our Christian life, and our church life.</S>
