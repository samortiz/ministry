[1]  A Living of Mutual Abiding with the Lord in Spirit CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE BORN TO LIVE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4a, 12-13; 3:5-6, 14-15; 6:57, 63; 10:10b; 11:25a; 14:19b-20; 20:22; Rev 1:18a THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF LIFE
[3]  In this series of messages we want to see the believers living of a mutual abiding with the Lord in spirit.
[4]  In reality the Bible is entirely a book on life, and this life which is referred to in the Bible is the Triune God as our life.
[5]  An ancient Chinese sage said that man is the spirit of all creation.
[6]  He also said, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit v. 6 . Later the Lord Jesus said, Because I live, you also shall live, and He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me 14:19; 6:57 . In the Gospel of John you can see these two words: born and live.
[7]  In Revelation 1:18 John testified of Jesus Christ as the One who said that He is the living One, and He became dead but is living forever and ever.
[8]  First, you must realize that formerly you had only your life, but now it is no longer you but the Lord Jesus who is living within you.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO LIVING WITH THE LORD Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 6:57b; 14:19; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:19-21a
[10]  In the previous chapter we briefly covered the matter of being born to live.
[11]  After our regeneration we live because of the Lord.
[12]  We might think that God wants us to take Him as life and live by Him as life merely because He does not want our life, that He wants only His life because our life is bad, wicked, and corrupt.
[13]  God is love, so He created us with a loving heart; He is light, so He created us in such a way that we like to be in the light; He is holy, so He created us with a nature that dislikes to be associated with evil elements and desires to be transcendent and uncommon; and He is righteous, so He created us with a nature that demands justice and uprightness.
[14]  They tell people that God so loved the world that He sent His beloved Son to become flesh and be a man, that this man was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world, and that if we confess that we are sinners and if we repent and receive this Savior, our sins will be forgiven, we will be reconciled to God, and we will even have fellowship with Him in peace.
[15]  First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that the last Adam, who is the Lord Jesus, the incarnated Word, after passing through death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
[16]  If you say that the Lord Jesus is not a creature, you do not confess that the Lord Jesus has come in the flesh.
[17]  Based on this they would dare not say that the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection and that this Spirit is the Holy Spirit, because if they say that this Spirit is the Holy Spirit, then the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not separated.
[18]  I am afraid that some among us who are still under the influence of the old concepts may think that it is heretical to say that the Lord Jesus had genuine blood and genuine flesh, because it would then mean that He was a real man, a creature.
[19]  The former says that the Lord is the Spirit, indicating that the Lord and the Spirit are one, while the latter says, The Spirit of the Lord, indicating that the Lord and the Spirit are two.
[20]  When you repent, confess your sins, pray, and believe in the Lord Jesus, you not only have peace within but have the forgiveness of sins so that the problems between you and God are resolved.
[21]  The key to having a proper spiritual experience is realizing the fact that two spirits have become one spirit the Spirit became one with our human spirit.
[22]  Authorities among Bible translators, particularly J. N. Darby, pointed out that it is difficult to say whether the word spirit in this verse denotes the Holy Spirit or our human spirit.
[23]  In my youth I heard messages on living with the Lord, although at that time what I heard was mostly on walking with the Lord and not so much on living with the Lord.
[24]  However, we praise and thank the Lord that because God took these two great steps becoming flesh in order to accomplish redemption for us and resurrecting from the dead in order to dispense Himself into us to be our life we all have become Christians who have the mingled spirit and who live with the Lord.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE MUTUAL ABIDING WITH THE LORD Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5; 14:23; Rom 8:9-10; 2 Tim 4:22 GOD DESIRING TO ABIDE IN MAN TO BE MAN S LIFE
[26]  The most mysterious matter in the Bible, something which we could never imagine or dream up, is that the Lord Jesus personally told His disciples that He wanted them to abide in Him and that He also wanted to abide in them.
[27]  First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
[28]  After His death and resurrection, the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and in John 20 He came to breathe into the disciples, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . From that time on, the Lord was in them.
[29]  In John 15 the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you v. 4 . This is a mutual abiding.
[30]  However, what the Bible tells us is not only walking with, being with, dwelling with, or living with, but even more it is mutually abiding in. If we walk with the Lord, we are with Him; if we are with Him, we dwell with Him; if we dwell with Him, we live with Him; and if we live with Him, we have the mutual abiding with Him.
[31]  Our living with the Lord depends on our dwelling with Him; our dwelling with Him follows our being with Him, and our being with Him requires our walking with Him.
[32]  God is Spirit and the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit, but this is not to say that the Spirit of God and the life-giving Spirit are two different Spirits.
[33]  By this time He had not only accomplished creation as the Spirit of God, He had not only accomplished redemption through the Holy Spirit, but even more He as the life-giving Spirit had consummated God s new creation, which is the church.
[34]  The Triune God was incarnated, passed through human living, died on the cross to accomplish redemption, and entered into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.
[35]  Today He enters into us to abide in our spirit with all that He has, all that He has gone through, all that He has accomplished, and all that He is.
[36]  The secret to abiding in the Lord is first to see that our Lord was God and therefore had the stories of God.
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16, 4 THE WONDERFUL REVELATION IN THE BIBLE
[38]  In the previous three chapters we saw the matter of our living with the Lord and our mutual abiding with the Lord.
[39]  The Bible is the most wonderful book, in which the most wonderful matter is that the Spirit of God is mingled with our human spirit and that we should live and walk according to such a mingled spirit.
[40]  Some may ask, since God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and since the Lord Jesus is the Son, then is the Lord Jesus only one-third of the Triune God, being neither the Father nor the Spirit but only the Son?
[41]  Actually, He is everything; He is the Lord, God, the Triune God, the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[42]  Not only so, the Bible speaks first of Christ being God and then of Christ becoming man.
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE EXERCISING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22 THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE BIBLE
[44]  In this message we will consider the matter of exercising to be one spirit with the Lord.
[45]  We believers in the Lord can actually become one spirit with the Lord.
[46]  I believe that if we were to take everything written by the Chinese philosophical, classical scholars concerning ethics and morality and put them together with all the teachings and writings of Confucius and Mencius, they still would not say as much as the Bible does, and their standard would be much lower than the Bible s. For the human race, the Bible teaches the most about ethics and morality and has the highest standard.
[47]  If you understand the Bible and you know the meaning of the existence of the universe, you will see that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, man s center is his spirit, and man s spirit is for containing God.
[48]  Today we must see that the central teaching of the Chinese sages was to promote and develop the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good.
[49]  The Bible also tells us that as soon as we repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, His redeeming blood cleanses us from our sins and His Spirit enters our spirit.
[50]  Today s Christianity mainly tells us how the Lord Jesus is God, how He became a man, died on the cross, washed away our sins, became our Savior, ascended into the heavens, and sat down at the right hand of the Father, and how now He is in the heavens as the object of our worship.
[51]  When we all meet together, if someone merely sits quietly and does not open his mouth to testify or pray, then he will not be able to enjoy the rich supply of the Lord in the meeting.
[52]  On the contrary, as long as you open your mouth in the meeting to testify, pray, or pray-read the Bible, you will be able to gain the enjoyment.
[53]  If you do not open your mouth, you will have nothing, but as soon as you open your mouth, you will be supplied inwardly.
[54]  CHAPTER SIX PRAY-READING THE WORD WITH OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Matt 4:4; 2 Tim 3:15-17; John 6:63; Eph 6:17-18a GOD S MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS HEART S DESIRE
[55]  The Bible shows us that God s basic desire concerning us is to work Himself into us to be our life, our life supply, and even our enjoyment that we may be full and satisfied so that He may live Himself out of us and be expressed through us.
[56]  However, for God to work Himself thus into us to be our life and life supply, two means are necessary.
[57]  On our side we contact Him daily and receive Him into us as our life, our life supply, and our enjoyment, while on God s side He works Himself into us.
[58]  The Bible tells us that it is through His Word and His Spirit that God is able to work Himself into us to be our life and our life supply.
[59]  I have repeatedly said that in order to redeem us the Lord Jesus was incarnated; He put on a body of flesh and blood, and then on the cross He died for us, suffered the judgment of God, and shed His precious blood to redeem us from our sins.
[60]  We have to see that God, who is our Lord, not only speaks to us but also breathes into us.
[61]  Therefore, whenever you come to read the Bible, if you just read the dead letters and do not breathe in what God has breathed out, then the Bible will be dead letters to you.
[62]  The words of the Bible are the breathing out of God, but when you turn them into prayer, they become your breathing in. Every word of the entire Scripture is the breathing out of God.
[63]  If you simply read in an ordinary way, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, this may be profitable, yet it is merely a revelation to let you know that the heavens and the earth were created by God, that is, to let you know their origin.
[64]  In Matthew 4 the Lord Jesus said, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God v. 4 . Every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God is the Scriptures.
[65]  He also said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57 . Because of His concern at that time that the disciples who listened to Him might not understand the meaning of His words, He added the words in verse 63, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
[66]  THE BEST WAY TO EAT CHRIST BEING TO PRAY-READ
[67]  Therefore, our conclusion is that to be a good and living Christian, one must eat every day.
[68]  CHAPTER SEVEN CONTACTING THE LORD THROUGH HIS WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2; John 5:39-40; 6:63-68; 14:21, 23; Psa 119:103, 105, 130, 147-148
[69]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for the constant cleansing of Your precious blood that we may receive mercy from You again to enter into Your word.
[70]  Lord, we take You once again as our sin offering and as our trespass offering.
[71]  Many dear Christians pay attention to the fact that our Lord Jesus is our Redeemer and our Savior.
[72]  Regrettably, they neglect the fact that this Lord Jesus, who is our Redeemer and Savior, is also today the life-giving Spirit, who has entered into our spirit to be our life.
[73]  Because of such negligence, I am particularly burdened to help people see from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is not only our Redeemer and Savior but that He is also the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit, living with us moment by moment and supplying us unceasingly.
[74]  The words which God has spoken to us throughout the ages have become the holy Word today in our hands.
[75]  The Bible is not just a sacred book, but even more it is God s breathing out 2 Tim 3:16 .
[76]  Furthermore, when we the believers in the Lord confess our sins and pray, calling on the Lord Jesus, and when we thus believe in Him and receive Him, He lives in us as our Savior.
[77]  Before we open the Bible, we must have in us an attitude of hunger and thirst for the Lord, and we should pray, Lord, I love You, I want You, and I hunger and thirst after You.
[78]  If you would read the Bible in this way every morning, always contacting the Lord through His Word, what you will gain in the end is not just the word of life but even more the Lord Himself.
[79]  Hence, if you read the printed pages with your mind, you will not be able to touch the Lord, but if you read with your spirit while crying from a hungry and thirsty heart, you will touch the Spirit in the Word.
[80]  One who eats the Lord s word has the Lord s word in him, on the one hand, to be a lamp unto his feet and a light unto his path, and on the other hand, to shine over him and enlighten him, giving him understanding to apprehend what human life is what it is to be a parent, to be a child, to fear God, and to live before men a life that is pleasing to God.
[81]  When you contact the Lord s word, just with a few words by the spirit the Lord s word will immediately enter into your spirit and touch your spirit.
[82]  In the meetings, however, all of us, especially those of us who speak for the Lord, must have sufficient prayer and exercise to use our spirit more than our soul or outward body, because we desperately want to allow the Lord to speak His word from our spirit.
[83]  Therefore, when you read the Bible, not only your eyes and mouth must cooperate, and not only must you use your soul to understand and love the Word, but you must also pray, expressing in prayer what you have read and understood.
[84]  In John 5:39-40 the Lord Jesus said, You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
[85]  This is why in John 6 the Lord also told us, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger v. 35 . Moreover, He said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57 . These passages show us that the Bible is not merely a book for us to receive religious teachings and obtain knowledge about God.
[86]  THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE MEANS FOR GOD
[87]  We all know that if we ate sand and got it into our stomach, this sand cannot supply us as food does, and it will even harm our body.
[88]  If you truly digest the Lord s word, even if you do not read Ephesians 5 but instead read John 6:63, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life, immediately you will have the inward process of digestion.
[89]  When you are reading, you must remember to pray over it verse by verse, because the Lord s words are life and truth and because this Lord is in our spirit today.
