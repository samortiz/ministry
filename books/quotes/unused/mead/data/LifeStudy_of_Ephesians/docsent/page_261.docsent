   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY DROPPING DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE GROWTH OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-14; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 6:12a; 2 Tim 4:7; Titus 1:13b; Jude 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that doctrine is included among the four categories of negative things that damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other three categories are ordinances, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because in our natural, religious concept, doctrine is positive and is viewed positively by most Christians, it is difficult to speak about doctrine in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Doctrine, however, can frustrate the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 4:14 Paul speaks of the negative effect of doctrine: That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to this verse, a verse which indicates that doctrine can damage the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus had a difficult time with those religious people who were steeped in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The scribes, Pharisees, elders, and chief priests argued with Him over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Little did they realize that they were actually arguing with God, the One who inspired the Old Testament on which their doctrines were based.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In their blindness they used the Scriptures to argue with the One who inspired the Scriptures and whose coming the Scriptures foretold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who were occupied with doctrine missed the opportunity to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not realize that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was not concerned for doctrine, but for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>DAMAGED BY DOCTRINE AND PHILOSOPHY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the church had been established and had begun to spread, problems in the churches were caused by doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 14 indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The doctrines concerning eating and observing days were derived from Judaism, not from heathen philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Roman Empire did persecute the church, this persecution did not damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, damage was caused by religious doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The situation that made it necessary to call the conference described in Acts 15 was caused by doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as doctrine caused damage to the church life in the first century, it can damage the church life in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church life has also been damaged by philosophy, especially by Gnosticism with all its concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we bring in concepts derived from our cultural background, we shall cause problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church life in the Lord s recovery can still be damaged by doctrine and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most Christians appreciate those who are knowledgeable in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But, in a sense, it may be a dreadful thing to acquire a vast knowledge of the Bible, if our Bible knowledge causes us to miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Remember that it was those who knew the Scriptures the Pharisees and the scribes who persecuted the Lord Jesus and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ones who are most opposed to the Lord s recovery are those with a certain amount of Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s concern is with Christ and the church, not with doctrine or Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, many Christians care more for doctrine than for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s economy is not to have a group of people who know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is to work Christ into His chosen people for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must condemn any doctrine that distracts us from Christ or that hinders us from being built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even doctrines that are scriptural or fundamental may be used by the enemy to distract us from Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan hates to see God s people built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although God s goal is to produce the Body by working Christ into us, most of His people have been distracted from God s economy and from His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Doctrines are among the good things utilized by Satan in his subtlety to distract God s people from God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason God has put His seal upon the recovery of the church is that in the recovery we are pursuing God s goal, not mere doctrinal knowledge.</S>
