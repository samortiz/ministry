Psalm 2:8 says, &#8220;Ask of me, and I shall give thee...the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.&#8221; The nations will be an inheritance to Christ, and the earth, including the uttermost parts, will be Christ&#8217;s possession. Then in Psalm 8 we have the exclamation, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think any of us could ever forget the word &#8220;earth&#8221; in Psalm 8. People today are intensely interested in the things of the heavens, but God is more interested in the earth. How excellent is His name in all the earth. Psalm 16:3 tells us of the excellent in the earth. We also have the words &#8220;lot&#8221; and &#8220;heritage&#8221; in this Psalm. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage&#8221; (vv. 5-6). The lot and the heritage of the Lord Jesus are the earth! Then in Psalm 22 we have more concerning the earth: &#8220;All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord&#8221; (v. 27). There is no mention of the earth in Psalm 23, but it is set forth in Psalm 24: &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fulness thereof; the habitable earth, and they that dwell therein&#8221; (v. 1).<p>God&#8217;s intention is to recover the earth for His Christ. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s. In Psalm 8, the Psalmist was gazing upon the heavens. He said, &#8220;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.&#8221; Yet his praise was, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; He considered the heavens, but his praise concerned the earth.<p>The Lord will recover the earth, the earth which is now usurped by the enemy. The secret is in Psalm 24. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s; so the Lord has the right, the title, to the earth. He realizes this right by the &#8220;hill.&#8221; The hill is the key, the stepping-stone, for the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the earth. Upon this hill is the house, and the house is built up with the brethren. The brethren were brought forth by the resurrection of Christ, and the resurrection issued from His crucifixion. Before His crucifixion, there was His wonderful life on this earth, a life which issued from His incarnation. Thus we have all these major steps leading up to God&#8217;s recovery of the earth: His incarnation in Psalm 8, His human living in Psalm 16, His crucifixion and resurrection in Psalm 22 (His resurrection is also mentioned or implied in Psalms 2, 8, and 16), His brethren in Psalm 22, His house in Psalm 23, and eventually the hill on the earth in Psalm 24. Keep in mind all these key words in these six Psalms about Christ. If we did not have the Psalms, but only the New Testament, how could we gain such an apprehension of Christ? We need the Psalms, but we also need heavenly vision to read the Psalms; otherwise we only receive a certain kind of inspiration. We must see in all these Psalms the precious stones, the gems, the vital points. It is not sufficient to receive merely a good feeling and vague inspiration.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
