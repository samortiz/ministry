	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>Concerning preaching the gospel in schools, we still need to fellowship regarding the aspect of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A PERSON OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>As persons who serve the Lord, we first need to learn and exercise to be persons of prayer. In the beginning of the church life, the believers in Jerusalem practiced having all things common. In Acts 6 the Jewish believers who spoke Greek were murmuring. They complained that their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing (v. 1). Then the twelve apostles gathered all the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. But...look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (vv. 2-4). This shows that the apostles, who were exercised in the ministry of the word, prayed continually and steadfastly.</p>
<p>All the full-time serving ones need to pursue the truth and growth in life. Both are crucial. However, there is still one matter that you must always learn and exercise in, that is, you must be a person of prayer. Whether you are a younger or an older full-timer, since you have given yourself to the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, you should pray. We should pray for the work we are participating in, pray for ourselves, and pray for the move of the work and the target of the work. We should also pray for the various details of our specific work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Look to the Lord in Our Heart</h2>
<p>For the propagation of the gospel in the schools, we need to visit the students in the dorms, distribute gospel tracts, and even lead small-group Bible studies with the students. We need to cover these matters with prayer. In other words, we need to saturate our work with prayer. The need in the schools is great. We should not say that we are too busy or that we do not have time. When we labor, we often discover that we do not have enough time to do everything. Even if this is so, we still need to pray. Prayer requires time. Even when we are short of time, we still need to pray. We must exercise to look to the Lord in our heart and lean on Him in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer Being to Tell the Lord<br />
That We Do Not Know What to Do<br />
and That We Are Not Able</h2>
<p>Prayer is the expression of our attitude toward the Lord that we do not know what to do and that we are not able to do anything. In principle, it is the poor who ask others for help; the wealthy do not ask for help. It is not easy for a person who is capable, knowledgeable, and resourceful to ask for help, because he has everything he needs. People in the world say that it is best not to ask for help. As those who serve the Lord, we have nothing; therefore, we can only say, &ldquo;In everything ask God.&rdquo; We should ask God concerning everything. In serving God, we should never think that we should ask God only when our inability to do something is manifested. It is our ability to do something that is useless. If a brother who is about to give a message prays only because he cannot speak well, he will not pray if he speaks well. Such a brother must realize that even if he were eloquent, his speaking would be useless. Whatever comes out of our natural ability is useless in our service to God.</p>
<p>We encourage the saints to get a good education, but if we try to apply what we have learned in our education to God&rsquo;s work, it will not be profitable. We encourage the saints to study Greek and to learn many languages, but we should not rely on what we have learned. We must regard both aspects. Some people are highly educated and renowned for their research, which qualifies them to be college professors, but they may not be useful in God&rsquo;s work. Having a higher education is useful when we exercise in prayer to do God&rsquo;s work. Otherwise, the education that we have received can act as veils on our mind, just as layers of dust on a window can block the light. Such veils can be removed only by prayer. How can God use a person with a hardened mind (2 Cor. 3:14-16)? We must learn to be a person of prayer.</p>
<p>To be a person of prayer does not mean that we are constantly kneeling in prayer. A person of prayer exercises to always have an attitude of being nothing. He may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I am useless.&rdquo; In Luke 17 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink? He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he? So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done&rdquo; (vv. 7-10). The slave had done many things for his master; however, when he went home, he still had to wait on his master, indicating that he was an unprofitable slave. Such is the attitude we should have when we pray.</p>
<p>We will not pray if we feel that we can do something. When our heart, our spirit, our attitude, our feeling, and our emotion are that we are useless and incapable of doing anything, we will pray and look to the Lord. Our problem is that we are short of prayer. In this matter not only the young serving ones need to practice, but also the older ones need to practice. We should always have such an attitude toward the Lord of being unprofitable slaves.</p>
