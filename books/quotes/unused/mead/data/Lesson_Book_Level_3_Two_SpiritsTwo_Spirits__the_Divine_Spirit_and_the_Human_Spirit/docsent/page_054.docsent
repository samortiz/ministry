   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Giving Up the Natural Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The natural life, the life of the soul, has been crucified on the cross Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we have to take the Lord as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must give up the natural life, the life of the soul, and take the Lord in the spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This doesn't mean, however, that we must give up the faculties of our soul, but the life of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the faculties of our soul still remain as the organs to be used by the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that all thoughts come from hell or that all intents come from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some thoughts come from the heavens, and some intents are for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But mostly we have a mixture in our thoughts and intents and need the living, operative, sharp word to pierce into us and discern our thoughts and intents, revealing which are of and for the self and which are of and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are left by ourselves, we cannot discern these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But once we experience the living word of God, it is easy to discern the thoughts that are not of God and the intents that are of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>RENEWED AND UPLIFTED A. An Uplifted Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more you are one with the Lord in the spirit, the more you are spiritual, the more keen you will be in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before you take the Lord as life, you are quite dull in your thinking, but if you deny yourself and take the Lord as your life, you will be very keen in your thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In China quite a number of older sisters never had any kind of education, yet they loved the Lord to the uttermost and knew how to give up themselves, taking the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After two or three years they became very keen in their mind, in their understanding, especially in the things of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They became experts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But with those who have little love for the Lord, even if they have a Ph.D., there is little comprehension of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you talk with them about the things of the Lord, they say, "What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot figure it out."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. A Spiritual Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the same thing with the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Don't think that the Lord demands that you give up the organ, the faculty, of your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord demands that you give up the life of the emotion, but you have to exercise the emotion more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do love the Lord and are really filled with the Lord's Spirit, you will be very emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man who is not emotional can never be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A spiritual person is a very emotional person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you never know how to love, if you never know how to weep, if you never know how to be happy, and if you never know how to be sorry, I am afraid that you are not a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most spiritual person is the most emotional, yet his emotion is under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Apostle Paul was very emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He tells us that at times he wept with tears Phil 3:18; Acts 20:19,31 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was quite tender in feeling, in love, in mercy, and in compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was tender, but he was not naturally emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His emotion was a spiritual emotion under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. A Strong, Renewed Will</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A spiritual person, on the one hand, is so keen in the mind and emotion, and on the other hand, so strong in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not one spiritual person is like a jelly-fish, without any backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Naturally emotional people are like jelly-fish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the spiritually emotional persons are so tender in their emotions and strong in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you are in the spirit, the stronger you will be in the will.</S>
