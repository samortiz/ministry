   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN DEALING WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we have seen the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we will study dealing with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We join these two lessons together because they are closely related in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times our spirit is not upright or correct because we have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the discipline of the Holy Spirit usually reveals the condition of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, it is only when we have dealt adequately with our spirit that we can accept from deep within the dealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. SCRIPTURAL BASIS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 51:10, "Renew a right spirit within me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A right spirit is not what we originally have, but is usually the result of God's visiting and dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Timothy 1:7, "God hath given us a spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of spirit, which is powerful, loving, and having a sound mind, is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatians 6:1, "In a spirit of gentleness."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spirit of gentleness which can restore those overtaken by a fault and which is possessed by the spiritual man must be the result of man having been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Peter 3:4, "The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of spirit is not only meek, but also quiet, and is therefore a most valuable ornament in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This must also be the result of man having been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Proverbs 16:19, "To be of a lowly spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A lowly spirit, a spirit which is not proud, is obtained through having been afflicted and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 5:3 "Poor in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that there is neither self-satisfaction nor self-righteousness in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of spirit is obtained by having passed through severe smiting and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 7:1, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse speaks of dealing with the spirit and removing all defilement therein that we may have a clean spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we desire to deal with the spirit, we must first be clear what the spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man is of three parts: body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The innermost and deepest as well as the loftiest part is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, we must especially point out that the spirit is the most genuine part of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may say that the spirit is the genuineness of man, the genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit is deeper than the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the spirit is more genuine than the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our living and acting must be according to our spirit that we may be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when we speak from our spirit are we speaking in genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only when we deal with others in our spirit are we dealing with them in genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even our spiritual activities, such as praying, fellowshipping, and preaching must all be done in our spirit to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Any activity without the exercise of our spirit is outward, shallow, and also false.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any activity not originating from the deepest part is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not an intentional pretension, but the use of a wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore we must learn to exercise our spirit and be a genuine person in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Generally, a man is most genuine when he loses his temper, for at that time his spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a man is not angry, he always follows a certain set of rules or etiquette outwardly, his real situation being hidden within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when he becomes extremely mad, to the point that he can neither bear nor hide his anger any more, he explodes regardless of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What he feels inwardly, he speaks forth outwardly; how angry he feels within, he expresses without; his outward manner depicts his real condition within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At this time his spirit, that is his genuineness, comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, one who is refined in appearance and who seldom loses his temper is usually a false man, while one who often loses his temper is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His genuineness lies in the fact that his spirit is being released.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In conclusion, the deepest and most genuine part of man is the spirit, and the spirit is the genuineness of man.</S>
