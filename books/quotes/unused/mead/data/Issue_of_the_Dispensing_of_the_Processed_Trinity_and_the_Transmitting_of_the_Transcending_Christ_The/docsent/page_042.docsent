   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 5:18 tells us not to be drunk with wine, that is, not to be filled in our physical body with wine.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Instead, we should be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit needs to be filled with the processed Triune God, with the transcending Christ, with the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we will be full of praise, singing and speaking one to another vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The melodies, the songs, are not only good for singing but also good for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as we are praising God, we will spontaneously be submissive to one another v. 21 . The wives will be submissive to the husbands, and the husbands will love the wives vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>22, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will have the proper church life, full of submission and full of praising to the Triune God, with no quarreling, no murmuring, and no complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 6 tells us something further.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, the church life is a praising life and a submitting life; at the same time it is also a fighting life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While we are praising and submitting to one another, the enemy is here fighting, so we have to fight against him by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 18 says that whenever we pray, we should pray in our spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are going to walk, we need to use our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can walk by his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even for someone to walk on his hands is awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To walk by our feet is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, we should not pray merely by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must pray by our spirit and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our spirit mingled with the Spirit has been mentioned six times in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that to know God's economy, to receive His dispensing, and to participate in Christ's transmission, we must know, we must use, and we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be persons in our mind but persons in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may be exercising our spirit to worship the Lord at His table, but afterward we may immediately turn to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wife may begin to think about how badly her husband treated her the previous evening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then her emotion gets stirred up and her will makes a decision to threaten him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the result of her not exercising her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She should not think about her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, she should praise the Lord in the spirit and pray in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do this, we will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we exercise our mind in an independent way, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we turn back to our spirit, we become the victor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not consider or talk about the things of the church life by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we exercise our mind to consider and speak of the church life, we will say that the elders are not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will also say that the old saints and the young people are not good and that the children are naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, to our mind nothing is good in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even when we are praying, a negative thought may come into our mind that a certain brother is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Quite often in our good prayer, we are stopped by just one thought.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Right away we have to shout, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus is Victor!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to chase away the enemy in our mind and continue to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes we may have to rise up from our knees and say, "Satan, get away!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, You are the Victor!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have any problem concerning the church, we must exercise our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will have the vision to see and the wisdom to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we will understand why there is the need of the onefold transmission to follow the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will see that this transmission is by the One who transcended from Hades through the earth, through the air, and through the third heaven to become higher than the heavens.</S>
