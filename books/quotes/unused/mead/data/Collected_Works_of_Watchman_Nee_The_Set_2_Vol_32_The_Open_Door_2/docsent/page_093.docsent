   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Philip Luan, Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the morning of the sixteenth, I went for a medical checkup at the Chiu-Shi Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank and praise the wonderful grace of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The result of the examination showed that other than the slight inflammation of the eyes and throat which was caused by my recent speaking and reading , my body was healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My blood pressure is thirty points lower than it was in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was in Ch'ang-sha, I had to give over three hundred cc of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then my blood pressure was only six points lower.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this time, it went down thirty points without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord has truly manifested His endurance and mercy on me, the chiefest of all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What else can I say?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can only thank and praise the Lord who lives forever for me with all of my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work began officially on the twelfth.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are over ten co-workers gathering here in Kulangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From this morning on, the co-workers are waiting on the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that the Lord will gain the glory He deserves through these gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not sure when the meetings will be concluded.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have received a letter from Hong Kong stating that Brother Kaung will leave for Chungking with his family around April 19 via K'un-ming and Kuei-yang.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A while ago Brother Lin Bao-shen came to Macao and preached the gospel for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it rained on the last day, there were still many people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That evening Brother Nee Hwai-tzu and Brother Chang Shi-wu stood up and gave a good word on the gospel after Brother Lin's preaching.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once he read 1 Corinthians 3 and Daniel 3 and shared something like the following: If we want our life and work to withstand the fire in the future, we must have the experience of His presence today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only the things we do in His presence count, because only these things will pass through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The three friends of Daniel were not hurt in the midst of fiery persecution and difficulty, because they had the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fire burned up their bondage instead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their clothing, signifying their righteousness, was not burned at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our God is a consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we see God's presence, we will not live in a loose way.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She gave her testimony a few times and spoke of the Lord's work in her, her Spirit baptism, her water baptism, and how she saw the truth concerning head covering and the church.</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May the Lord Himself give her leading.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Two or three of them are brothers from Fu-Ching and Fukien, and the other three or four were baptized by Brother Leland Wang a few months ago.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I intend to go there, but I am still waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sister Ding is resting in the National Hospital; her illness needs our prayer.</S>
