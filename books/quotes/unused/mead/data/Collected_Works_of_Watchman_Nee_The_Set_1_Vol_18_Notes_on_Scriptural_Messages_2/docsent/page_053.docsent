   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" John 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not know if you realize what thirst is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once a ship was about to sink, and all the people on board ran to the small lifeboat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this small boat, there was food, but no fresh water to quench their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although water was all around, they remained thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although water was on all sides of their small boat, they were still dying of thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Doctors know that thirst is more intolerable than hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thirst is a desire unfulfilled, a request ungranted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Someone may say, "I have a hope, but it is not fulfilled," or "I have a wish, but it has not been realized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My mouth is thirsty."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The world has many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But even if it gives you the best thing, you will still be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The world has many beautiful things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But even if it gives you the most beautiful thing, you will still be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The world has many great things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But even if it gives you the greatest thing, you will still be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All that the world can give to you is temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you drink it, you will still be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After drinking a cup of wine, you will want more to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After seeing a movie, you will want to see more movies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After attending a big feast, you will desire to eat again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After gaining a reputation, you will desire to have money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After you have money, you will desire to have a good family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After you have a good family, you will desire to have good children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After you have good children, you will desire to have a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once you drink what the world gives you, you will still be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you receive something from the world, it will only make you desire more the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord says, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What kind of water is "this water"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"This water" is whatever the world can give to men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"This water" is the worldly things which temporarily satisfy a person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the world simply creates a bigger capacity within you; it causes you to drink and still want more to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was a person whose father died for his faith during the Boxer Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He thought at one time that if someone would help him to graduate from elementary school and make twenty to thirty dollars, he would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later someone helped him graduate from elementary school, and he was making twenty to thirty dollars every month.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after a short while, he compared himself with others and desired to go to high school.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, someone helped him finish high school.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as he finished high school, he desired to go to a university.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Someone helped him study in a university.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After graduation he wanted to study abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He thought that if he could get a Ph.D. degree, he would be satisfied and have no other desire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Again someone helped him, and he was able to study abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, he also received his Ph.D. degree.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He came back to China and became a university professor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But he said, "Someone with a Ph.D. is not necessarily happier than an elementary school graduate."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day he was satisfied; he received the Christ that his father had died for.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He now works for the Lord and is no longer thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may think that as long as they can gain something in school or in business, they will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But I must tell you that even if you gain something it will only be a temporary satisfaction; it cannot quench your thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those sitting here may have some desires and strong cravings to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may have a dream before you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I must tell you that even if your dream comes true and your desires are fulfilled, you will not be satisfied; you will still dream and still say that there is a place within that is not yet satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Friends, may we see that all things are vanity and will not quench our thirst after we drink them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I had a friend who grew up in the same place as I did.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He went through college and was the Chief of Police for one term.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he believed in the Lord, he went to testify to one of his former colleagues, a military person who had some power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When his colleague saw him with a plain cloth gown, he asked, "Are you happy?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said, "Just look at me, and you will know that I am happy."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His colleague said, "What about your wife and children?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He answered, "The Lord Jesus is the One thinking about them; He is the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The colleague said, "Have you ever thought about what you will do for the rest of your life?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, "God is responsible for me for the rest of my life."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His colleague marveled at him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here was a person who had gone through college and had been the Chief of Police.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After he had believed in the Lord, there was a peace within him which others did not have.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When he departed, his old friend said to him, "I wish that I could drop all I have to get what you have."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No political power can satisfy man, nor can an excellent position satisfy man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If there is any friend here who is not yet satisfied, I must tell you that everyone who drinks of the worldly water will thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The worldly water can never satisfy you.</S>
