The resurrection of Christ is truly a mystery. In His mysterious resurrection, He brought the humanity that He had put on into His mysterious divinity. When He became flesh, He brought divinity into humanity. When He resurrected from the dead, He brought humanity into divinity. This caused God and man to be mingled as one. Hence, today we are living in His divinity, and God is living in our humanity. God and we have the same life and the same living.</P><P>Moreover, as the mysterious only begotten Son of God, in His mysterious resurrection He was begotten with His humanity as the Son of Man to be the mysterious firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29), causing all His believers to be resurrected with Him and to be brought forth as the sons of God to be His brothers, who constitute the church of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:19; Heb. 2:11-12), which is His Body. This is indeed a mysterious birth. Every one of us has a part in this birth. Furthermore, in Christ's mysterious resurrection, this last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) and is now ready to be received by those who believe in Him. Once we believe in Him, this life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and joins us to His Spirit, so that we become one spirit with Him. We must see this truth. This is a most important item in our Christian experience. Only by being the Spirit can He enter into us to be our life and our living. If Christ cannot live in us, salvation becomes objective. But now that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection and is living in us, God's salvation becomes subjective to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man Ascending to the Height</H2><P>The sixth point is that this mysterious God-man, in His mysterious resurrection, ascended to the height with all the ones whom He resurrected (Eph. 4:8a; 2:6). This was accomplished in Christ's resurrection before we were born. We have to realize that we human beings are limited by time. But with God there is no time element. With Him there are only the facts; with Him there is no element of time. After Christ resurrected, He brought all the ones that He had resurrected, that is, those who believe in Him, to the height. In His mysterious ascension, there are sixteen items of what He has obtained and attained, what He is doing in this age, and what He will accomplish in the future.</P><P>First, He offered to God the ones whom He resurrected. God in turn gave them back to Him, and He gave them as gifts to the church (Eph. 4:8b). Second, He mysteriously fills all in all (Eph. 4:10; 1:23). Third, He mysteriously sat on the right hand of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3b). Fourth, He mysteriously was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor (Rev. 3:21; Heb. 2:9). Glory is the splendor into which Christ's person, with divinity and humanity, entered, and honor is the preciousness which the worth of Christ attained and the dignity which the position of Christ reached. Fifth, He became mysteriously the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22), that all things may be subjected under His feet. All of this is to the church. Sixth, He became mysteriously the Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). To be Lord denotes Christ's being Lord of all men and all things in His divinity with His humanity (Acts 10:36). To be Christ denotes Christ's being anointed by God to accomplish God's eternal economy. Now this mysterious God-man is not only the Lord of all but also the Christ of God, bearing the commission to fulfill God's eternal economy. Seventh, He became mysteriously the Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31). He is the Ruler of all the kings of the earth for the arranging of the world situation, in order that He can be the Savior of all kinds of men.</P><P>Eighth, in such a mysterious ascension, He poured out Himself, the One who had entered into glory and attained honor, as the consummated, essential, and economical compound Spirit upon all His believers, baptizing them into His mysterious Body, the church of God (Acts. 2:17-18; 1 Cor. 12:13). Ninth, He became mysteriously the surety of the better covenant, that is the new covenant (Heb. 7:22), to be a guarantee to man. He shed His blood and died to enact the covenant, and He became the surety of such a covenant in resurrection. Tenth, He became mysteriously the Mediator, that is, the Executor, of the new covenant as a testament (Heb. 9:15). When Christ was on the earth, He enacted the new covenant through His death (Matt. 26:28) and left this new covenant as a testament, or a will, to His believers. Then He resurrected and ascended to the heaven to be the Executor of the testament that He enacted and left to His believers (Heb. 8:6), executing upon us all the bequests of the new covenant, such as the effectiveness of His all-inclusive death, His resurrection in power, His divine life, and the law of life to be our supply and enjoyment. Eleventh, He became mysteriously the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens, ministering heaven into us (Heb. 8:1-2). In other words, He ministers to all the believers the heavenly life and the divine and rich heavenly supply. Twelfth, He became mysteriously our Advocate with the Father, pleading for us (1 John 2:1b). Before the righteous God, He became our Advocate, pleading for us, that the interrupted fellowship between God and us may be recovered. Thirteenth, He became mysteriously the High Priest, interceding for us and saving us to the uttermost (Heb. 4:14-16; 7:25-26). Fourteenth, He became mysteriously the Son of Man as the High Priest walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, the churches (Rev. 1:13-16; 2:1). He is our High Priest, caring for the churches in His humanity.</P><P>Fifteenth, heaven will retain Him until He comes to be the Bridegroom to marry His bride, His overcomers, and to set up His kingdom and reign with His overcomers (Acts 3:21; Rev. 19:7-9; 11:15; 20:4, 6). Sixteenth, He became the mysterious Lamb of God as the center of the New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 22:1-3). In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the New Jerusalem is the eternal habitation of the Triune God with us the redeemed people. Its center is the Lamb on the throne.</P><P>God is a mystery, and the mystery of God is Christ. This Christ is the mysterious Word of God, taking on the form of flesh and passing through human living in His humanity with His mysterious divinity. He was crucified, accomplishing the all-inclusive and mysterious death, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens. This totality of what Christ is, what He has done, all that He has passed through, and all that He has attained, obtained, and established constitute the story of the mystery of God. May this mysterious story of God become our subjective knowledge and our practical living.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 18, 1990)</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
