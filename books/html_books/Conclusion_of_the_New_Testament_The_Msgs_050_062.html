TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Portion of the Saints</h2><p>In Colossians 1:12, Paul speaks of Christ as the portion of the saints. When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians, and was speaking of the portion of the saints, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel in the Old Testament. The Greek word rendered &#8220;portion&#8221; in Colossians 1:12 may also be translated &#8220;lot.&#8221; Paul used this term with the Old Testament record of the land as the background. God gave His chosen people, the children of Israel, the good land for their inheritance and enjoyment. Each of the twelve tribes received an allotment of the good land, which is an all-inclusive type of Christ. Today, as God&#8217;s chosen people, the saints, we have Christ as our portion. Just as the good land was all things to the children of Israel, so Christ is our portion, our lot, our everything.<p>If we would understand the matter of Christ as the believers&#8217; portion, we need to read Colossians 1:12-29, verses that describe different aspects of this portion, or lot. This portion is the image of God and also the Firstborn of all creation (v. 15). As to His divinity He is the image of the invisible God. In His humanity He is the first item of God&#8217;s creation. He is also the Firstborn in resurrection (v. 18), the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the One in whom all the fullness of the divine Trinity dwells (v. 19). This One must have the preeminence, the first place, in everything. Because He is the One who has the preeminence in all things, He redeemed and reconciled all things to God. This wonderful, all-inclusive Christ is our portion for our enjoyment in the divine dispensing.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 is the expression, &#8220;our Lord Jesus Christ...theirs and ours.&#8221; Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers. He is the portion given to us by God. We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of this Christ who is ours (1 Cor. 1:9). That Christ is ours means that He is our portion. All the believers have Christ as their unique portion. We have been called into the fellowship, that is, into the participation and enjoyment, of this portion, and this portion is God&#8217;s power and wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:24). In God&#8217;s economy we have been put into this portion, and God has made this portion our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30).<h2 class=head2>2. God</h2><p>As the believers&#8217; portion, Christ who is our Savior is God (Titus 1:3; 3:4), the Triune God, to us. We may not realize that the Triune God is our portion for our enjoyment. Instead, we may regard God merely as an object of our worship. When worldly people talk about God, they usually think of Him as an object of worship. But for us, believers in Christ, God is not only an object of worship; He is a portion for us to enjoy.<p>Chapter four of the Gospel of John reveals that God is for our enjoyment. In His conversation with the Samaritan woman the Lord Jesus indicated that the real worship of God is to drink of God, to drink of the living water in our spirit. In verse 14 the Lord says, &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&#8221; In verse 24 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&#8221; When we put these verses together, we see that the real worship of God is enjoying Him as our drink in our spirit. This surely indicates that, as God, Christ is for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>3. Redeemer</h2><p>Christ is also our Redeemer. In Him we have redemption (Rom. 3:24). The word &#8220;redeem&#8221; means to purchase back something which originally was ours but which has become lost. Thus, redemption means to repossess at a cost.<p>Originally we belonged to God; we were His possession. However, we were lost. God was not willing to give us up. He paid the price to have us back, repossessing us at a great cost. This is redemption.<p>Even after we had become lost, God desired to regain us. This was not easy for Him to do because our being lost involved us in sins and many other negative things that were against His righteousness, holiness, and glory. Because we were lost, we had many problems with God in relation to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. Many requirements were laid upon us, and it was impossible for us to fulfill them, for the price was too great. Christ paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Heb. 10:12; 9:28). His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).<p>As believers, we may enjoy Christ as our Redeemer. Ephesians 1:7 says, &#8220;In whom we have redemption through His blood.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in whom&#8221; refers to &#8220;the Beloved&#8221; in Ephesians 1:6, indicating that we have been redeemed in the Beloved, in the One in whom God delights. Therefore, in the sight of God redemption is something to be delighted in. Although it is accurate to say that we are redeemed in Christ, this is not as delightful as saying that we are redeemed in the Beloved. In God&#8217;s delight, the Beloved, we have redemption. We have been redeemed through the blood of God&#8217;s Beloved shed for us on the cross, and now we may enjoy the Beloved as our Redeemer.<h2 class=head2>4. Passover</h2><p>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul compares the believers at Corinth, and himself as well, to the children of Israel. He takes the history of the children of Israel as the background for this Epistle. This gives us the ground to say that the history of the children of Israel is a full type of our Christian life in the church. In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says, &#8220;Our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.&#8221; If Christ was Paul&#8217;s Passover, then He must be the Passover for every believer. What happened to the children of Israel as a type should be our experience today. They experienced the Passover; we also have a Passover, a Passover that is Christ Himself. Christ is not only the Lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross for our redemption and reconciliation to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God.<p>A further revelation of Christ as our Passover is found in chapter six of the Gospel of John. A verse near the beginning of this chapter says, &#8220;The Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near&#8221; (v. 4). This indicates that the Passover was the background for what is recorded in John 6. With the Passover feast as the background, the Lord Jesus fed the multitude with five loaves and two fishes and then went on to speak concerning Himself as the bread of life and also of our need to eat His flesh and drink His blood (vv. 35, 51, 53-55, 57). The Passover in verse 4 signifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who shed His blood for our redemption and gave His flesh for our feeding. At the Passover people slay the redeeming lamb, strike its blood, and eat its flesh (Exo. 12:3-11). This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain so that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, thus taking Him in as the life supply for us to live by. In the Lamb of God there are two elements: the blood for redeeming and the meat, the flesh, for feeding. Today we may enjoy Christ in the way of redeeming and in the way of feeding as well. As the Lamb, the center of the feast of Passover, He is for our enjoyment. As we feed on Him, we take Him as our life supply.<h2 class=head2>5. Savior</h2><p>We the believers were fallen sinners before God. God sent Christ to save us from our sins and from our fallen state. He was born to be our Savior (Luke 2:11), and His name was called Jesus, meaning Jehovah our Savior, for He shall save His people from their sins (Matt. 1:21). He also saves us from God&#8217;s condemnation, death, and eternal perdition (John 3:18; 5:24; 10:28). Furthermore, He also saves us in our daily life (Rom. 5:10), and He would save us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). We should experience and enjoy Him as such a Savior.<h2 class=head2>6. Wisdom</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says that Christ &#8220;became wisdom to us from God.&#8221; Paul does not say that Christ is wisdom to us; he says that Christ became wisdom to us. This indicates that at one time Christ was not wisdom to us but that later He became wisdom to us. Christ could not become wisdom to us before we were in Him. But when we believed in Christ, God put us into Him, and then Christ became wisdom to us.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us. For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience. Paul composed verse 30 in the way he did in order to indicate to the believers that Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God. Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience. As we face certain problems and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ as our wisdom. If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle various problems and matters. This is to apply Christ as wisdom in our daily life.<p>Wisdom may be understood as the way to do things. If we have wisdom, we shall know the proper way to do things. But if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way to do things in our daily life, we must have wisdom. Christ as wisdom to the believers is actually the divine way. Hence, wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse where the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the way.&#8221; God&#8217;s way is His wisdom. If we enjoy His Christ and participate in Him, we shall have Him as our wisdom, as our way. How do we receive the wisdom we need? This wisdom comes from our enjoyment of Christ. Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we do this, we shall enjoy Christ and have Him as our wisdom, as our way of doing things. This is Christ as wisdom to the believers.<h2 class=head2>7. Righteousness</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:30 indicates that Christ is our righteousness. Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life.<p>Some of us may think that we have the righteousness of Christ. This is not correct. Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself. Instead of saying that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness, we should say that Christ Himself has become our righteousness. God has made Christ, the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.<p>Christ is both our objective and subjective righteousness. As our objective righteousness, Christ is the One in whom we are justified by God. Justification is God&#8217;s action in approving us according to the standard of His righteousness. In Christ as our objective righteousness before God we are justified, approved, by Him.<p>As our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God. When we live this Christ and express Him, He becomes our daily righteousness. Actually, Christ as our subjective righteousness is our life; He is the One whom we live and express as righteousness. This is the surpassing righteousness mentioned in Matthew 5:20. Therefore, objective righteousness is the Christ we received when we believed in Him in order to be justified before God (Rom. 3:26). Subjective righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness in our daily living. As believers we need not only to receive Christ as our righteousness objectively but also to live Him as righteousness subjectively. In Christ, who is our righteousness, we have been justified and saved. But after receiving Christ we need to live Him so that He may become our subjective righteousness. This subjective righteousness is Christ lived out of us in our daily life.<p>Christ as our righteousness is for the believers&#8217; enjoyment. Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we have Him as our righteousness not only objectively but also subjectively. This means that when we exercise our spirit to contact Him, we become righteous. The more we contact Him and enjoy Him, the more righteous we become in Him. Eventually, by having Christ wrought into us the believers become the very righteousness of God in Christ.<h2 class=head2>8. Life</h2><p>Colossians 3:4 speaks of &#8220;Christ our life.&#8221; Christ is God and also life (1 John 5:12). The life which is God, the life that God is, is in Christ (John 1:4). Hence, the Lord Jesus said that He is life (John 14:6; 11:25) and that He came that we may have life (John 10:10). Therefore, he who has Christ has life (1 John 5:12), and He now dwells in the believers as life. Just as life is God Himself, so also life is Christ. Just as having life is having God Himself, so also having life is having Christ. Christ is God becoming life to us. Through Christ God is manifested as life. Therefore, Christ is now our life.<p>Human words cannot express adequately what it means for Christ to be our life. But even though we cannot define this life fully, we can experience and enjoy it. We should not stop with the doctrinal knowledge that Christ is our life. Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way day by day. He should be our life within, and we should have one life and living with Him.<p>For Christ to be our life means that He is subjective to us to the uttermost. Nothing is more subjective to us, or more intimately related to us, than our life. Our life is actually we ourselves. It is impossible to separate a person from the life of that person, for a person&#8217;s life is the person himself. If we did not have life, we would cease to be. To say that Christ has become our life means that Christ has become us. Since our life cannot be separated from us and since Christ is our life, He cannot be separated from us. Because our life is our self and because Christ is our life, we may say that, in this sense, Christ has become us.<p>For our physical existence everything depends on our having life. If there were no life in our body, everything related to us would be terminated. Without life we could not have such virtues as love and submission. Everything associated with human living is based on human life. This illustrates the crucial importance of Christ being the believers&#8217; life. It is vital for us to see that the all-inclusive Christ is our life.<p>With Christ as the believers&#8217; life there are three characteristics. First, this life is a crucified life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always lived a crucified life. If we truly experience Christ as our life, we also shall live a crucified life. Such a crucified life is a life that has been processed and thoroughly dealt with. The second characteristic of Christ as our life is that this life is a resurrected life. Nothing, including death, can suppress it. Finally, this is a life hidden in God (Col. 3:3). Only the divine life can be hidden in God. If we experience Christ as our life, what we do in the church will not be done in a showy way but rather be done by a life hidden in God.<h2 class=head2>9. Sanctifier</h2><p>In relation to the believers Christ is also the Sanctifier. Hebrews 2:11 says, &#8220;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one.&#8221; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3). Both the firstborn Son and the many sons are thus the same in the divine life and nature.<p>If Christ had not been incarnated, He would not be able to sanctify us according to God&#8217;s economy. The Sanctifier is not only the Son of God but the Son of God incarnated. As the incarnated One, Christ is the Son of Man. This Son of Man could not sanctify us until He had been crucified, resurrected, glorified, and exalted. These are His qualifications to be our Sanctifier. With respect to His human nature Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of resurrection and thereby became the firstborn Son of God. Now as the firstborn Son He is the Sanctifier. He can sanctify us because He has two natures, divinity and humanity, and because we, the many sons of God, also have two natures, human and divine. Our Sanctifier, therefore, is not the only begotten Son of God; He is the firstborn Son of God, the One who has the human nature as well as the divine nature. Because He and we are of the same two natures, He can sanctify us. He is qualified to be our Sanctifier, and we are qualified to be sanctified. Now as the Sanctifier He, the firstborn Son of God, is working on us, the many sons of God.<p>Christ, our Sanctifier, sanctifies us not only positionally but also dispositionally. This means that He gives us not only a change in our position but also a change in our disposition. This means that the Sanctifier is actually the Transformer, for He transforms us in our disposition, saturating our entire being with Himself as the new element that causes a metabolic change in our character.<p>Hebrews 13:12 is another verse that speaks of Christ as the Sanctifier: &#8220;Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.&#8221; The blood of the sin offering being brought into the Holy of Holies on the day of atonement to make atonement for the people and its body being burnt outside the camp (Lev. 16:14-16, 27) typified the blood of Christ, the real sin offering, being brought into the true Holy of Holies to accomplish redemption for us and His body being sacrificed for us outside the gate of the city of Jerusalem. Christ&#8217;s body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification so that we may be a people sanctified unto God. Christ suffered the death of the cross, shed His blood on it, and entered the Holy of Holies with His blood (Heb. 9:12) so that He might be able to do the sanctifying work by the heavenly ministry (Heb. 8:2, 6) of His heavenly priesthood (Heb. 7:26) and that we might, by His blood, experience Him as our Sanctifier, as the One who sanctifies us both positionally and dispositionally.<h2 class=head2>10. Sanctification</h2><p>Christ is not only our Sanctifier; He Himself is our sanctification (1 Cor. 1:30). This means that Christ is the element that produces transformation. Apart from Him we cannot have the element that, when added to our being, produces a metabolic change.<p>Whereas the crucified Christ was for our justification, the resurrected Christ is for our sanctification. As the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, Christ lives within us for our sanctification. As the life-giving Spirit, He is our life, and He is saturating our being with His holy nature until we are thoroughly sanctified dispositionally. Sanctification, therefore, is not only positional by the Lord&#8217;s blood but also dispositional by the divine life, even by the living Christ Himself. The Lord is now working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference. Then we shall be completely saturated with His holy nature. Separation, or objective sanctification, can take place rather easily and in a very short time. But it takes a long time for us to be sanctified dispositionally. If we remain under the dispensing of the Triune God, experiencing Christ as our dispositional sanctification, we shall daily be saturated with the divine nature until we are thoroughly transformed in mind, emotion, and will.<h2 class=head2>11. Redemption of Our Body</h2><p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is even our redemption, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). As the One who is our redemption, Christ &#8220;will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory&#8221; (Phil. 3:21). The body of humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). The body of glory is the resurrected body, saturated with God&#8217;s glory and transcendent over corruption and death.<p>According to 1 John 3:2, we shall be like Christ &#8220;because we shall see Him even as He is.&#8221; Today we are not like the Lord in our body. But when our body is transfigured, fully redeemed, we shall be wholly like Him in spirit, soul, and body. As the redemption of our body, Christ Himself is the element by which we shall be transfigured in our body to have His glorious likeness.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(31)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>12. The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>For the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment Christ is the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh. As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins. Furthermore, when He was crucified, He dealt with our natural life and our self. This made it possible for us to receive the divine life. After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in His resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us. We may not realize that we have received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior but also as the life-giving Spirit. When we believed in Christ, we knew that we were sinful. Therefore, we prayed, repented, confessed, and received Him as our Redeemer. Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as the Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit for the purpose of dispensing life into us. As the life-giving Spirit He is the life-dispensing Spirit.<p>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and the life pulse of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would not mean nearly as much to us. It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life and would then be comparable to the resurrection of Lazarus. The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce anything related to life. But Christ&#8217;s resurrection is absolutely a matter related to life, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to dispense life into the believers. Therefore, resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ, but is very much related to us subjectively. Resurrection was not only an act in itself; it was also a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection Christ, who ended the old creation, became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation. When Christ entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life. Actually, this life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. The Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, and now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit with the life essence to germinate the new creation. We have become the new creation germinated by the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.<p>Furthermore, the life-giving Spirit is the totality of all Christ is as the all-inclusive One. First Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called (1:2, 9) is all-inclusive. He is God&#8217;s power and God&#8217;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30); our glory for our glorification (2:7), hence, the Lord of glory (2:8); the depths of God (2:10); the unique foundation of God&#8217;s building (3:11); our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, and the spiritual rock flowing out the spiritual drink (10:3-4); the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12); the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam. As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all He is for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>13. The Freeing and Transforming Spirit</h2><p>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is also the freeing and transforming Spirit. All three aspects of Christ as the Spirit are found in 2 Corinthians 3. In verse 6 we have the Spirit who gives life; in verse 17, the freeing, liberating, Spirit; and in verse 18, the transforming Spirit.<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; According to the context, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord (2:12, 14, 15, 17; 3:3, 4, 14, 16; 4:5). This, then, is a strong word telling us emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. Furthermore, the phrase &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord&#8221; indicates that the Spirit and the Lord are one. Where the Spirit of the Lord is means where the Spirit, the Lord, is. The Spirit of the Lord is actually the Lord Himself, with whom there is freedom. The freedom here is the freedom from the letter of the law (Gal. 2:4; 5:1).<p>The Lord is the Spirit who gives us freedom. Because the Lord is the Spirit, when we turn to Him, we are freed from the bondage of the letter of the law. Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is no bondage, no deadness, no entanglement of letters and regulations. Because Christ as the freeing Spirit is within us, we are free from the law, bondage, regulations, and dead letters.<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now doing a transforming work within us as He imparts Himself into us as life. When we open to Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, we are under the process of transformation. All that He is, is transfused into our being. Through being transfused with what He is we shall have a complete transformation. We shall be transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another, until eventually we are the same as He. This takes place only by means of Christ as the Lord Spirit.<p>The glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the glory of Christ as the resurrected and ascended One, the One who is both God and man. This One passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, having accomplished full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ dwells in us to make Himself and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and may be transformed into His image from glory to glory. When we with an unveiled face behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. As a result, we are transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. This transformation is from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit is upon the Lord Spirit. This means that the Lord Spirit as the rich supply is continually added into our being.<p>The image in verse 18 is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. The &#8220;same image&#8221; indicates that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is. This transformation into the same image is from one degree of glory to another degree, for transformation is a continuing process in life in resurrection.<p>The title &#8220;Lord Spirit&#8221; may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression again strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Lord Christ.<p>The word &#8220;transformed&#8221; implies the unsearchably rich supply of Christ. As we receive this supply, it replaces the old element within us and causes it to be discharged and carried away. The result is that something new is brought forth in us, just as new cells and tissues are produced in our body through the process of metabolism. The fact that this is Paul&#8217;s concept of transformation is indicated by His word that we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. For the believers&#8217; experience of transformation, Christ passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive, life-giving, freeing, and transforming Spirit dwelling in our spirit. This Spirit is now dispensing the resurrected Christ with all His riches into us for our transformation.<h2 class=head2>14. The Door to Leave the Fold</h2><p>For the believers Christ is also the door to leave the fold (John 10:9). The fold in John 10 signifies the law and also Judaism, the religion of the law. Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law. The law was the fold where God&#8217;s people as the sheep were kept and protected temporarily until the pasture, the permanent place for the sheep, was ready. Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for God&#8217;s people to stay. Before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily. However, the Jewish religion utilized the law to form Judaism, which then became the sheepfold.<p>John 10 reveals that Christ is the door through which God&#8217;s people leave the fold and come to the pasture. God no longer intends to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law. He wants them to come out of the law into Christ. Now, during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door. Christ has come, and the pasture is ready. There is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaic law. They must be released from the fold of the law to enjoy the riches of the pasture. Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture.<p>Today, in the sight of God, the various denominations, sects, and independent groups are folds. Furthermore, a fold is anything formed into a legality. Anything that is first used by God and then becomes a legality is a fold. For example, baptism by immersion is correct, but if we make this a legality, we shall form another fold. To be kept from legality concerning anything used by God, we should care only for Christ and focus on Him.<p>As the door to leave the fold, Christ is our freedom from legality. In Christ we have the freedom to go in and go out. This means that we do not have any legality. The freedom we enjoy is Christ Himself. Because Christ is our freedom, our door, we are not bound by any legality. This does not mean, of course, that we are free to indulge the flesh (Gal. 5:13). In Christ we are not in bondage to legality. Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom.<h2 class=head2>15. Pasture</h2><p>John 10:9 says, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&#8221; Outside the fold is the green pasture, which signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available, the sheep must be kept in the fold temporarily. When the pasture is ready, the sheep should come out of the fold and remain in the pasture permanently. As believers in Christ, we should now enjoy Him as our pasture.<p>The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly&#8221; (John 10:10b). This means that, because He is their pasture, Christ came to impart Himself as life to His sheep. As long as the sheep stay in the pasture, they will have the supply of life abundantly. By feeding on the pasture the sheep will enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply, for the Lord Jesus is their abundant life. They will enjoy Him and experience Him as their life.<p>In order to be the pasture of life to the sheep Christ had to die for them. All the living grass eaten by the sheep must pass through the process of death. Hence, the Lord laid down His life for His sheep (John 10:11, 15). Christ had to die for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them.<p>There is a hymn that speaks of the Lord Jesus as the One who brought us out of the fold and into Himself as the pasture:<p class=hbody>Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd,<br>Brought us right out of the fold<br>Into His pasture so plenteous,<br>Into His riches untold.</p><p class=hbody2>Glorious church life,<br>Feasting from such a rich store!<br>Here where we&#8217;re dwelling in oneness<br>God commands life evermore.</p><p class=hbody>In the divisions He sought us,<br>Weary and famished for food;<br>Into the good land He brought us,<br>Oh, to our spirit how good!</p><p class=hbody>Jesus Himself is our pasture,<br>He is the food that we eat;<br>We as His sheep are fed richly<br>Each time, whenever we meet.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #1221<p>The pasture is a place of tender grass; that is, a pasture is a place full of the supply of life. When sheep are in the pasture, they do not lack food. Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In our daily Christian life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.<h2 class=head2>16. Shepherd</h2><p>In addition to being the door and the pasture, Christ is our Shepherd. He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold (John 10:3). Then He goes before the sheep, and they follow Him (v. 4). As the Shepherd, Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture.<p>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says of Himself, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; As the good Shepherd, Christ laid down His psuche life, His human life, for the sheep so that they may have the zoe life, the divine life, the eternal life. Now He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life, not in the way of outward activity. Inwardly we have Christ as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life. Because Christ shepherds us by being life to us from within, the more we live by Him as our life, the more we enjoy His shepherding. On the one hand, Christ lives in us. On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him. When we live in the Lord in this way, we are under His shepherding. As we are under Christ&#8217;s shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life. The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way. This life consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that we are under the Lord&#8217;s shepherding.<p>The real Shepherd is the living Christ. As our Shepherd, the Lord not only gives us life; He is life to us. The living of Christ within us is actually His living shepherding. Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.<p>As the believers&#8217; Shepherd, Christ forms them into one flock (John 10:16), the one, universal church, the one Body of Christ, consisting of all the believers in Christ. The Lord supplies His sheep with Himself as life so that there may be one flock and one Shepherd, one Body and one Head. This one flock is very different in nature from a fold. A fold is a religious organization; the one flock is the church. As our Shepherd, Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock, where we are in the pasture enjoying Him as our life and life supply.<h2 class=head2>17. The Vine</h2><p>In John 15 we see the focus of what God is doing in the universe. Here the Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ. In His economy God is growing Christ, and all of us are branches in Christ as the true vine. Therefore, to us as believers, Christ is the vine.<p>No plant other than the vine tree can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ. As believers, we are branches of the vine and are good for nothing except to express the vine. All that the vine is and has is expressed through the branches. Individually, the branches are the regenerated ones. Corporately, they are the church, the Body of Christ. The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father.<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, He branched out into us. This branching out has made us branches of Christ as the vine. Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life.<p>The vine is everything to the branches. Whatever is in the vine is also in the branches. This indicates that as the vine Christ is a great enjoyment for us, the branches. From the vine and through the vine we receive everything we need: life, nourishment, light, water. Therefore, we need to abide in the vine. Only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to them. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said concerning Himself as the vine and us as the branches, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (John 15:4). Our life and our enjoyment are to abide in the vine. Our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine.<p>In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221; A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine. The relationship between the branches and the vine portrays the relationship between us and the Lord. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him. What we are, what we have, and what we do must be in the Lord and by the Lord in us. Therefore, it is crucial for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us. Otherwise, we shall be finished and be nothing. We should not do anything in ourselves; rather, we should do everything by abiding in the vine. Christ as the vine is our portion, an all-inclusive portion, for our daily enjoyment. Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then in our experience Christ will be everything to us for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>18. The Abiding Place</h2><p>To the believers Christ is also the abiding place. In John 15:4 He tells us to abide in Him. The Greek word translated &#8220;abide&#8221; means not only to remain in a certain place but also to dwell there, even to make our home there. Christ is our abiding place, our dwelling place, our home, and we need to be fully settled in Him.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(32)</h1><p>In this message we shall see more concerning what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>19. The All-inclusive One with the Unsearchable Riches</h2><p>To the believers Christ is the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches. In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us. As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, the Christ. As man He is the Apostle, the Shepherd, the Forerunner, the Captain of our salvation. There are countless aspects of the riches of Christ, for He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. For example, Christ is the real gravity. Without Him, we would drift away. As the One with the true holding power, Christ upholds the entire universe (Heb. 1:3). Because all positive things signify Christ, when He was on earth He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself. Using a door as a picture of Himself, He could say, &#8220;I am the door&#8221; (John 10:9). He is also the real light, life, breath, water, food, clothing, and dwelling place.<p>The riches of Christ also include both human virtues and divine attributes. Christ is the real love, patience, and forgiveness. Apart from Christ we cannot love, be patient, or forgive. But when we have Christ, we have the uplifted human virtues and also certain of the divine attributes.<p>As believers, we need to know and experience the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are for the producing of the church as His expression. This takes place through the divine dispensing of Christ into the believers. The church is produced not by teaching nor by organizing but by the dispensing of Christ. The more Christ is dispensed into us, the more life we have, the stronger life we have, the richer life we have, and the more uplifted the church life becomes. The riches of Christ produce the church through our experience and enjoyment of Christ. On Christ&#8217;s side it is a matter of dispensing; on our side it is a matter of experience and enjoyment. When we experience and enjoy the Christ who is dispensed into us, we become part of the proper church life. By absorbing the riches of Christ we become the Body of Christ as His fullness to express Him. Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ that have been enjoyed and assimilated by us.<p>The unsearchable riches are the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). How all-inclusive and extensive these riches are! The very fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment.<p>It is significant that Paul&#8217;s word concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ is found in the book of Ephesians. If we are to know the real significance of these unsearchable riches, we need to consider the context of the whole book of Ephesians. We may regard these riches merely as things such as peace, joy, and rest. However, if we touch the depths of Ephesians, we shall see that the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ are much more profound than joy, peace, and rest. We certainly do not despise these things. However, we may consider them too much according to our human understanding and need, not realizing that the unsearchable riches of Christ refer to something much more profound. We cannot say that joy, peace, and rest are unsearchable. The word &#8220;unsearchable&#8221; in Ephesians 3:8 should cause us to realize that the unsearchable riches of Christ must refer to matters that are profound, far beyond our understanding.<p>In chapter one of Ephesians Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know three great and profound matters: the hope of God&#8217;s calling, the riches of the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, the power God exercised in raising Christ from among the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, a power that is now being transmitted to us and applied to us (vv. 18-22). These three categories of profound matters are aspects of the unsearchable riches of Christ. When Paul spoke regarding the unsearchable riches of Christ, he was referring to such important matters as the hope of God&#8217;s calling, the riches of the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance, and the surpassing greatness of His power, not merely to such minor items as joy, peace, and rest. Therefore, if we would know the unsearchable riches of Christ and testify of them, we need to know the hope of God&#8217;s calling, the glory of God&#8217;s inheritance, and the greatness of God&#8217;s power exercised in Christ. We all need to receive a vision of these profound matters.<p>Christ is our Redeemer, Savior, Forerunner, Captain of salvation, and the Author and Perfecter of faith. All these aspects of Christ are part of His unsearchable riches. Nevertheless, not even these aspects of Christ cover His unsearchable riches as revealed in Ephesians. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that in order to know Christ&#8217;s unsearchable riches, we need to consider the entire book of Ephesians and see how various expressions in this book convey the unsearchable riches of Christ. For example, Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all. Because Christ is the One who fills all in all, His riches are unsearchable. We do not have the ability to search them out or to comprehend them. We cannot even adequately understand the expression &#8220;all in all.&#8221; What is the meaning of these two &#8220;alls&#8221;? We can only say that Christ, the all-inclusive One, fills all things in all things in the universe.<p>The unsearchable riches of Christ are also related to His position in His ascension. Ephesians 4:8 says that Christ has &#8220;ascended to the height,&#8221; that is, to the highest place in the universe. What is the highest place? How shall we measure it? We can neither understand what this place is nor can we measure it. Furthermore, according to 4:8, when Christ ascended to the height, &#8220;He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&#8221; When Christ ascended to the height, God the Father gave to Him as gifts the ones Christ had taken captive. Having received these gifts, Christ then gave them to the church, His Body. In this verse we also have an aspect of Christ&#8217;s unsearchable riches.<p>Ephesians 1:10 speaks of a &#8220;dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&#8221; The heading up of all things in Christ is according to God&#8217;s eternal dispensation, according to God&#8217;s economy, His administrative arrangement. The economy or dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times. God has made Christ the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22). Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth. This will be God&#8217;s eternal administration and economy. God created the universe for the purpose that at the fullness of the times all things will be headed up in Christ according to His administrative economy. This also is a part of the unsearchable riches of Christ.<p>As revealed in Ephesians, Christ is everything in God&#8217;s economy. Christ is the center and also the circumference. Using the illustration of a wheel, we may say that Christ is the hub, the rim, and all the spokes. Christ is every aspect of this great &#8220;wheel&#8221; in the universe. How unsearchably rich He is!<p>Concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ, we may only know matters such as joy, peace, and rest, or we may know aspects of Christ such as the Redeemer, Savior, Forerunner, and Captain of salvation. However, even these matters and aspects we may know only in a superficial way, not in a deep and thorough way. Furthermore, we may know Christ as the Savior but not at all as the Sanctifier. But even if we do know these aspects of Christ in a deep way, we are still in the realm of the riches of Christ, not of the unsearchable riches of Christ, for these aspects of Christ are rich but not unsearchably rich. To know Christ as the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches we need to consider what is revealed of Christ in a verse such as Ephesians 1:10. In reading the book of Ephesians some may pay attention to grace in 2:8, perhaps regarding it merely as unmerited favor, without even realizing that there is a verse that speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, or that there are many verses that reveal these profound riches. It is crucial for us to realize that the Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the Christ with unsearchable riches.<p>The all-inclusive Christ died an unsearchable and all-inclusive death. Through His death He took away our sins, dealt with our sinful nature and with the old man, and destroyed the Devil. In particular, according to the book of Ephesians, through His death Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). All the different customs, habits, and ways of living have been abolished by the cross of Christ. The unsearchable Christ died an unsearchable death. Therefore, the riches and the dimensions of Christ&#8217;s death are unsearchable. It is beyond our ability to measure or search the riches of Christ. We need to know these riches and experience them by considering all the profound matters revealed in the book of Ephesians.<h2 class=head2>20. Spiritual Food</h2><p>Christ is also the believers&#8217; spiritual food. In 1 Corinthians 10:3 Paul says, &#8220;All ate the same spiritual food.&#8221; This refers to manna (Exo. 16:14-18), which typifies Christ as our daily life supply (John 6:31-35) for the Christian journey. We believers should all eat the same spiritual food, not eating anything other than Christ.<p>According to God&#8217;s economy, we should live on Christ and on Christ alone. Christ should be our unique food, and we should not seek to live on any other food. Whatever satisfies, strengthens, and sustains us is our food. The unique food we should take for our sustenance, strength, and satisfaction as believers should be Christ. We all should be able to testify that only Christ satisfies us and that daily we are strengthened, sustained, and satisfied by Him.<p>The Christ who is our spiritual food is the Christ who becomes subjective to us. He is the processed Triune God indwelling our spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit. How wonderful that Christ is within us subjectively! The main purpose for His being subjective to us is that He may be our spiritual food. Anything that is to be our food and life supply must be something that can enter into us and then be digested and assimilated by us to become part of the very tissue and fiber of our being. Christ is subjective to us in precisely this way. When we eat Christ as our spiritual food, we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Hence, the Christ who is subjective to us, to whom we are joined and with whom we are one spirit, is our spiritual food.<p>The sixth chapter of the Gospel of John presents Christ as the believers&#8217; spiritual food. In verse 48 the Lord declares, &#8220;I am the bread of life.&#8221; The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). In verse 33 Christ refers to Himself as the bread of God, who came down out of heaven and gives life to the world. Christ, the very God, became flesh in order to be the bread of life for us to eat. He came from heaven not only to be our Savior but also to be our food. We need to realize how much we need Christ as our daily food.<p>John 6 is unique in giving many details concerning Christ as the bread of life, as our spiritual food. In this chapter we have five characteristics of Christ as our bread: heavenly bread (vv. 41, 50, 51, 58), the bread of God (v. 33), the bread of life (v. 35), the living bread (v. 51), and the true bread (v. 32). As the bread that came down out of heaven, Christ is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God. As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life. As the living bread, He is living. As the true bread, He is the bread of truth or reality. Christ is the true food, and all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food. The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ. He is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. We all need Him to be the bread of life, the spiritual food, to us.<p>In John 6:57 the Lord says, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; To eat is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we shall live by Him whom we receive as our food. It is in this way that Christ lives in us as the resurrected One (John 14:19-20).<h2 class=head2>21. The Rock Flowing with the Spiritual Drink</h2><p>Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 10:4 indicates that Christ is the rock flowing with the spiritual drink: &#8220;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&#8221; The spiritual drink here refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6), which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). We should all drink the same spiritual drink, not drinking anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.<p>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock. At Calvary He was crucified, smitten by God&#8217;s law with its power and authority. His side was cleft (John 19:34), and living water flowed forth for us to drink. This living water is the Spirit, the ultimate issue of the Triune God. This spiritual drink quenches our thirst and fully satisfies our being.<p>Literally, the Greek words rendered &#8220;a spiritual rock which followed&#8221; are &#8220;a spiritual following rock.&#8221; The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God&#8217;s chosen people was a physical rock. Yet Paul calls it a spiritual rock because it typifies Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, Paul says that the rock was Christ. Because it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following the believers.<p>We should not regard the eating and drinking of Christ as mere parables or metaphors. These are facts. Daily, even hourly, we should eat and drink of the Lord Jesus. In John 6 the Lord says that He came from heaven to be our food. This is not a parable or a metaphoric utterance; it is a divine fact. In John 7:37 and 38 He goes on to say that whoever thirsts may come to Him and drink and that out of his inner being will flow rivers of living water. This also is a heavenly fact.<p>Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily living, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance. It is by our eating and drinking of Christ that God works Himself into us. By eating and drinking we take the Lord in, and He becomes one with us organically. As we eat and drink certain elements, those elements are taken into us and become one with us in substance and essence. As we eat and drink, our food becomes one with us organically, and, when it has been digested and assimilated, it actually becomes part of our being, our very fiber and tissue. Realizing this will help us to see the importance of eating and drinking the Lord. We all need to eat Him and drink Him.<p>According to the biblical record, drinking is more important than eating. In the Scriptures more is said about spiritual water, or the water of life, than about spiritual food. If we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall realize that we need drinking even more than eating. For this reason, in 1 Corinthians Paul emphasizes drinking more than eating. In 1 Corinthians 12:13 he says that we have been given to drink of one Spirit. Actually, drinking includes eating. This means that the spiritual food is included in the water of life. Without the water of life, we cannot have spiritual food. Therefore, if we fail to drink, we shall not be able to eat.<p>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life grows in the river of water of life. This reveals that wherever the water of life flows, there the tree of life grows. The fact that the river flows from the throne and that the tree grows in the river indicates that the spiritual drink is even more crucial than the spiritual food. To the believers Christ is both spiritual food and the rock flowing with the spiritual drink.<h2 class=head2>22. Light</h2><p>In His person to the believers Christ is also light. John 1:4 says, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8221; It is absolutely true that the life is the light. When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine light came into our being. Immediately we had the sense of something shining within, but perhaps, at the time, we did not have the language or the utterance to describe it. That shining was the shining of Christ as light. Because this light shines, the life is the light of men. The shining of the light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God to be His children.<p>When the Word is heard and life is received, the life becomes the light shining within to enlighten us. When Christ, as the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening. Having been born of God by receiving the Word, we have the divine life, eternal life, and this life becomes the light shining within us. Christ is the Word of God, the expression of God by which we may know God. When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us.<p>Ephesians 5:14 also indicates that Christ is light to the believers: &#8220;Wherefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you.&#8221;<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(33)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>23. The Way</h2><p>In His person Christ is the believers&#8217; way to the Father. In John 14:4 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You know where I go, and you know the way.&#8221; Notice that the Lord uses the words &#8220;where&#8221; and &#8220;way.&#8221; In verse 5 Thomas replies, &#8220;Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?&#8221; Then the Lord answers, &#8220;I am the way...no one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (v. 6). This verse reveals that Christ is the way and indicates that the &#8220;where&#8221; is the Father. Because the way is a living person, the Son, so the place must also be a living person, God the Father Himself. Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons. The way is the Son, and the where, the place, is the Father.<p>To have Christ as our way to the Father means that when we take Christ, we get the Father. When we walk in Christ as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father. Hence, we take Christ as the way and we reach the Father as the place. The living way for us to get into God the Father, the living place, is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.<p>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus does not say, &#8220;No one comes to heaven except through Me.&#8221; He says, &#8220;No one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s intention is not to bring us into heaven but to bring us into God, into the Father. Christ is not the way to bring the believers into heaven; He is the way to bring the believers into the Father. Through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection we have been brought into the Father. The Son is in the Father, and we also are in the Father because we are in the Son.<p>The Father is holy and dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), and we are sinful. We are also involved with the world, Satan, and other negative things, all of which are obstacles that make it impossible for us to come to the Father. Sin, the world, and Satan are three great obstacles that make access to the Father impossible. It is impossible for us to overcome these negative things and to clear the way. Therefore, we need Christ as the way to the Father, as the means by which we may come to the Father.<p>Through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, and Satan. This means that He has cleared away all the negative things, all the obstacles, between us and God. Now, having dealt with the negative things, Christ Himself is our way to the Father. We simply need to enter into Christ, and He will bring us to the Father. Through His death Christ cleared the path, and now He Himself becomes our way, the only way, into the Father. When we get into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father. Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God. Because we are in Christ we are immediately brought into the Father. This is not a mere doctrine; it is a spiritual fact. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way. Christ is the unique way for us to enter into God.<p>As believers we can testify that we have God and that we enjoy God. The way by which we enter into God the Father is the crucified and resurrected Christ with His redemption (John 14:2b-3; Heb. 10:19). Christ has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation. Now there are no longer any obstacles between us and God. When we call on the Lord, we are immediately in the presence of God. We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with Him, and then God becomes our enjoyment through the divine dispensing.<p>Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; This indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. When we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us. Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is now the access for us to touch God the Father and to enter into Him.<h2 class=head2>24. The Reality</h2><p>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus also says that He is the reality. Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality. The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is the reality. As the way to the Father, Christ is the reality. If He were not the reality, He could not be our way. The way needs the reality. If we call on a name other than the name of the Lord Jesus, we shall not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.<p>The reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus is the being and the doing of the Triune God. First, this reality is the incarnated God (John 1:1, 14). This reality is also the Son (John 8:32, 36) and the Spirit (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6). Hence, the reality is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done. This is the gospel (Eph. 1:13). The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.<p>In the universe only what God is and what God does are real. This means that the reality in the universe is God&#8217;s being and God&#8217;s doing. God&#8217;s being is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption. In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him. Now when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.<p>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination. When we get on the way, we arrive at the destination. This means that when we receive the Lord Jesus, we have the Father. When we receive the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination. Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father. This is the reality becoming the way. This is the Son with what He has done becoming our way to the Father. We get on this way simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. When we call on the Lord&#8217;s name, we have the reality, we are on the way, and we have the Father.<h2 class=head2>25. The Hope of Glory</h2><p>To the believers Christ is also the hope of glory. In Colossians 1:27 Paul speaks of &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; Christ not only dwells within us; He dwells within us as our hope of glory. Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life and our person. According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we also shall be manifested with Him in glory. He will appear to be glorified in our redeemed and transfigured body (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21; 2 Thes. 1:10). When Christ comes, we shall be glorified in Him, and He will be glorified in us. This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body. This will cause our body to be transfigured and to become like His glorious body. At that time Christ will be glorified in us. This is Christ in us as the hope of glory.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in Ephesians 1:18 about the hope of His calling is related to Christ&#8217;s being the hope of glory. Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know certain things, the first of which is the hope of God&#8217;s calling. Before we were saved, we had no hope. We were &#8220;apart from Christ...having no hope and without God in the world&#8221; (Eph. 2:12). But now that we are saved, we are no longer without hope; instead, we are full of hope. However, because many believers do not know what a hope is theirs, Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know the hope of God&#8217;s calling.<p>As God&#8217;s called people we are full of hope, which is Christ Himself. First Timothy 1:1 speaks of &#8220;Christ Jesus our hope.&#8221; Christ is not only our Savior; He is also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of eternal life. Our hope is singly and uniquely Christ. Every aspect of our hope is related to Him. Other aspects of our hope include the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly sphere and glorification (Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21); the coming salvation of the soul (1 Pet. 1:5, 9), the Lord&#8217;s bringing of our soul into His enjoyment; the kingly enjoyment with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:18; Matt. 25:21, 23); and the consummate enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem with the universal and eternal blessings in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5).<p>In Colossians 1:27 Paul specifically says that Christ is the hope of glory. Glory is the expression of God. God has ordained that we should be brought into this glory (1 Cor. 2:7), and, as believers, we have been called into this glory (1 Thes. 2:12; 1 Pet. 5:10). Furthermore, when we were regenerated, Christ as the life of glory came into us as a divine seed that eventually will blossom into the full expression of God. The Christ who was God&#8217;s expression, the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory (Heb. 1:3), now dwells within us to be our hope of glory. Glory is still a hope to us because it has not yet come out of us in a visible way. Just as we hope for the blossoming of a seed that has been sown, so we hope for the blossoming of the life of glory that is now within us. Our hope of such a glory is the indwelling Christ Himself.<h2 class=head2>26. Peace</h2><p>Speaking of Christ, Ephesians 2:14 says, &#8220;He Himself is our peace.&#8221; The word &#8220;our&#8221; refers to different peoples, to the Jewish and Gentile believers. The peace spoken of here is not that between God and man but that between one man and another. Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near not only to God but also to God&#8217;s people. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, in that He has made both one. Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&#8217;s redemption this separation has been removed. Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, the bond of peace. The very Christ who has removed through His redemptive death the separation between the Jews and the Gentiles is now our peace.<p>The Gospel of John also presents Christ as the believers&#8217; peace. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful&#8221; (John 14:27). The peace Christ gives overcomes all troubles and fears, especially those caused by the persecution of religion. When the Lord Jesus spoke these words, the disciples followed Him at the risk of losing their lives, or, at the very least, of losing the way to earn their living. Because the disciples were under the fear of the opposing and persecuting religion, the Lord told them that in Him they had peace. He left His peace with them, a peace that is actually the Lord Himself. No matter what opposition and persecution we may face, the Lord Jesus within us is our peace, and we may enjoy Him as peace.<p>In John 16:33 Christ said, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but be of good courage, I have overcome the world.&#8221; This reveals that the believers have peace in the overcoming Christ. Although the Lord Jesus died and has been resurrected, we remain in the world where there is no peace. In this world we shall have only trouble. But the Lord Himself will be our peace, and we can have peace in Him. No matter how much this world troubles us and persecutes us, the Lord has overcome the world. We do not need to worry nor to fear the world. The world may persecute us and trouble us, but Christ is our peace, and He has overcome the world.<h2 class=head2>27. Joy</h2><p>In His person Christ is joy to the believers. &#8220;These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full&#8221; (John 15:11). The context of this verse is the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the vine and the branches being an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life (John 15:1-11). For us to be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy-a joyful life. If we abide in the Lord and keep abiding in Him by abiding in His love so that we may bear much fruit to express the riches of His life for the glorification of the Father, we shall be filled with joy. Our joy always comes from our abiding in the Lord, from our abiding in His love, from our fruit-bearing in His rich life, and from the expression and glorification of the Father. In this kind of life we are full of a joy that is actually Christ Himself.<p>In John 17:13 the Lord Jesus again speaks concerning His joy being made full in the believers. In His prayer to the Father, He said, &#8220;Now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world that they may have My joy made full in themselves.&#8221; The fullness of joy is in the real oneness. When we are one in the Father&#8217;s name by the Father&#8217;s life, enjoying the Father together, we shall have the Lord&#8217;s joy made full in us. This is the reason that when we are truly one, we are filled with praise to the Father. This praise is the overflow of the inner joy. We rejoice in oneness with the overflow of joy.<p>In Philippians 3:1 Paul says, &#8220;For the rest, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, and for you it is safe.&#8221; Here Paul charges the saints to rejoice in the Lord. His word indicates that rejoicing in the Lord is a safeguard, a security. For Paul to write to the saints about rejoicing in the Lord was safe to them. There must have been a situation in Philippi that required a safeguard, some kind of protection. The situation Paul had in mind was the trouble caused by the Judaizers. As a protection from that trouble, Paul encouraged the saints to rejoice in the Lord.<p>In Philippians 4:4 Paul says, &#8220;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&#8221; All believers need to rejoice in the Lord. Those who do not rejoice are wrong, and those who do rejoice are right. According to Paul&#8217;s word here, we should rejoice in the Lord always. This rejoicing affords us the strength for the oneness spoken of in Philippians 4:2 and 3. If believers are to think the same thing, it is necessary for them to learn to rejoice. Rejoicing in the Lord is also the secret of having the excellent characteristics listed in Philippians 4:5-9. If we would have the virtues found in these verses, we need to rejoice in the Lord. Therefore, rejoicing in the Lord is very important.<h2 class=head2>28. Rest</h2><p>In His person Christ is the believers&#8217; rest. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus sounded out a call related to Himself as rest: &#8220;Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&#8221; The labor mentioned in this verse refers not only to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations, but also to the labor of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever labors thus is always heavily burdened. After the Lord Jesus had praised the Father, acknowledging the Father&#8217;s way and declaring the divine economy (Matt. 11:25-27), He called such laboring ones to come to Him for rest. Rest refers not only to being set free from labor and burden under the law and religion or under any work and responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.<p>In Matthew 11:29 Christ gives us the way to rest: &#8220;Take My yoke on you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your souls.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligations of the law or religion, nor to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord Jesus lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&#8217;s will (Matt. 26:39-42). Therefore, He asks us to learn from Him, the One who is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means not to resist opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. In all the opposition the Lord Jesus was meek, and in all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, no matter what the situation was, He had rest in His heart. He was fully satisfied with His Father&#8217;s will.<p>The Lord Jesus said that if we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him, we shall find rest to our souls. The rest we find by taking the Lord&#8217;s yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest; it is not anything merely outward in nature.<p>If we are opposed as we minister for the Lord, and we resist, we shall not have peace. But if instead of resisting we submit to the will of the Father, we shall have rest in our souls. Christ always submitted to the Father&#8217;s will, taking God&#8217;s will as His portion and not resisting anything. As a result, He was always at rest. We need to learn of Him and also take this view. If we do, we shall have rest in our souls, a rest that is actually the indwelling Christ Himself.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(34)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover further aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>29. The Feast</h2><p>Colossians 2:16 and 17 say, &#8220;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&#8221; All the aforementioned items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come. The body, like a man&#8217;s physical body, is the substance. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of man&#8217;s body. Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Him. For us as believers, Christ is the feast, the new moon, and the Sabbath.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in Colossians 2:16 and 17 indicates that to the believers Christ is the real feast. The word &#8220;feast&#8221; in verse 16 refers to the annual Jewish festivals, signifying joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Three times a year God&#8217;s chosen people came together for the annual feasts, which were times of enjoyment, of rejoicing together before the Lord. Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ. He is the real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>30. The New Moon</h2><p>Colossians 2:16 and 17 also indicate that Christ is the new moon. The new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness. Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today. Before we came to the Lord, we, like all unbelievers, were in darkness. Now we have Christ as the new moon.<h2 class=head2>31. Sabbath</h2><p>In Colossians 2:16 and 17 we see that Christ is the Sabbath, which signifies completion and rest. Without completion, we cannot rest. Rest always comes from completion and satisfaction. When we have finished a certain matter and are satisfied with it, we are then able to be at rest. After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day. Likewise, we also can enjoy rest only when our work has been completed and we are satisfied with it. Therefore, the Sabbath signifies Christ as the believers&#8217; completion and rest.<p>According to Colossians 2:16 and 17, Christ is the reality of the various aspects of the ceremonial law, which are shadows of spiritual things. The festivals, the new moons, and the Sabbaths were all shadows. The body, the solid substance, of these shadows is Christ. Such a Christ is now for our enjoyment and experience.<h2 class=head2>32. The Armor</h2><p>Ephesians 6:11 opens with the words, &#8220;Put on the whole armor of God.&#8221; To fight the spiritual warfare, we need Christ as the armor of God. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior, not an individual believer, can wear the armor of God. This is contrary to the concept held by many Christians that an individual believer is able to wear the entire armor. The armor in Ephesians 6 is not for the believers as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body. This chapter reveals not the believers fighting as individuals, but the believers fighting as a corporate entity for God&#8217;s interests on earth. Therefore, we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.<p>According to Ephesians 6, Christ is the armor that we put on for our protection. In order to fight in the spiritual warfare, we must put on Christ as the whole armor of God. In Ephesians 6:14-17 there are six aspects of Christ as armor: the girdle of truth, or reality; the breastplate of righteousness; the firm foundation of the gospel of peace (the shoes); the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit. Of these six aspects of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare. All the other items are for defense.<p>We need to put on Christ as the whole armor of God so that we &#8220;may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil.&#8221; These stratagems are the Devil&#8217;s evil plans. Not only does the Devil have an evil will, but he also has subtle stratagems to work out his will. If we would stand against these stratagems, we need to put on Christ as our armor. Let us now consider briefly the six aspects of Christ as armor to the believers.<h2 class=head3>a. The Girdle of Truth</h2><p>Ephesians 6:14 says, &#8220;Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth.&#8221; For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being. For the purpose of standing, our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth. Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and expressed by us as our living. This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us (John 14:6). Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our being for spiritual warfare. Our living must have a principle and a standard. This is nothing less than God in Christ expressed in our living in a practical way. When such a truth girds our loins, we are made strong.<p>The truth with which we are girded for spiritual warfare is the Christ we experience. In Philippians 1:21 Paul says, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; This Christ whom Paul lived was his girdle of truth. This Christ was God expressed and revealed in Paul&#8217;s daily walk. Because Paul&#8217;s daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances. Because Paul had been girded about with truth, he had the strength to stand.<h2 class=head3>b. The Breastplate of Righteousness</h2><p>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness, which covers our conscience, signified by the breast. In fighting against Satan, our accuser, we need a conscience void of offense. But no matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is a matter of being right with both God and man. If we have a problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which our faith and boldness will leak out. Therefore, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy&#8217;s accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30).<p>The righteousness which covers our conscience and that guards us from Satan&#8217;s accusations is Christ Himself. He is the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience. Hence, we are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness. Furthermore, the breastplate of righteousness is related both to Christ and to His blood. In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ cannot cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness to cover our conscience.<h2 class=head3>c. The Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</h2><p>Ephesians 6:15 says, &#8220;Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.&#8221; Our feet need to be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle. The phrase &#8220;the firm foundation of the gospel of peace&#8221; means the establishment of the gospel of peace. Christ made peace for us on the cross both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel (Eph. 2:13-17). This has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness for our feet to be shod with. Thus, we shall have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation is also Christ (Eph. 2:14).<p>The gospel of peace spoken of in Ephesians 6:15 is the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross for us to be one with God and for the Gentile believers to be one with the Jewish believers. This peace is our gospel. With this peace there is preparation, readiness, a firm foundation. This firm foundation is a secure footing for our standing. Therefore, the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross is a firm footing, a firm foundation. As we fight against the evil powers, the peace Christ accomplished is a firm foundation for our peace. If we would take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation. We fight in peace and with peace; we fight by standing in peace. Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints. This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy.<p>The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the firm foundation of the gospel of peace are all Christ. He is our truth, our righteousness, and our peace. Christ is God expressed and revealed, Christ is the righteous element that covers us, and Christ is the peace that enables us to stand. Therefore, if we would be victorious in the spiritual warfare, we need Christ as our girdle of truth, as our breastplate of righteousness, and as our peace to be our firm foundation.<h2 class=head3>d. The Shield of Faith</h2><p>Ephesians 6:16 continues, &#8220;With all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.&#8221; We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as the standing for our feet, and faith to shield our entire being. If we live by God as truth, we have righteousness (Eph. 4:24), and righteousness issues in peace (Heb. 12:11; Isa. 32:17). With all these we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith (Heb. 12:2).<p>The shield of faith is not something that we put on; it is something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith. This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy.<h2 class=head3>e. The Helmet of Salvation</h2><p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul says, &#8220;Receive the helmet of salvation.&#8221; This is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God&#8217;s salvation. Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts. God&#8217;s salvation is the covering we take up against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ we experience in our daily life (John 16:33).<p>Satan&#8217;s darts come to us through our mind. Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation. We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith. Then faith brings in salvation.<h2 class=head3>f. The Sword of the Spirit</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul also tells us to receive &#8220;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&#8221; The sword is the one item of the armor that is used for attacking the enemy. After we put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and we take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation, we are entirely protected, and we may then receive the sword of the Spirit.<p>In verse 17 the antecedent of the word &#8220;which&#8221; is Spirit, not sword. This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). Paul speaks of &#8220;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&#8221; Is the sword here the sword of the Spirit or the sword of the word? The Spirit is the sword itself, not the one who uses the sword. The word of God is also a sword. The sword is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. Here we have three that are one: the sword, the Spirit, and the Word. In our Christian experience the Word and the Spirit must always be one. Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit. In our experience we receive the Spirit mostly through the Word. As we contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to us. Christ is both the Spirit and the Word. He is not the Spirit without being the Word, nor the Word without being the Spirit.<p>As we engage in spiritual warfare against the enemy, our only weapon is the Spirit-Word, which is the sword. We do not use cunning craftiness; we wield the sword of the Spirit. Our loins are girded with truth, and our conscience is covered by Christ as our righteousness. Then we have peace as our firm foundation, for we are standing on the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross. Furthermore, we are protected by the shield of faith and guarded by the helmet of salvation. Then we have the Spirit-Word as the sword that slays the enemy. This is to fight the spiritual warfare with Christ as the whole armor of God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(35)</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>33. The One Living within Them That They May Live Him</h2><p>We come now to the very important and vital matter of Christ being the One who lives within the believers so that they may live Him. Christ is not only our life; He as a person lives in us. All Christians need to realize that we have another person-Christ-living in us. We need to see the vision that the very One who died on the cross to redeem us is now living within us.<p>Christ, on the one hand, is in the third heavens. But on the other hand, He lives within us. Christ became the life-giving Spirit in order that He might live in us. Without being the life-giving Spirit, it would not be possible for the heavenly Christ to live in us. According to the New Testament revelation, Christ is both the ascended Lord and the life-giving Spirit. As the ascended Lord He is sitting in the heavens at the right hand of God, and as the life-giving Spirit He lives within us. Now we have Christ not only as our life but also as our person. Because He lives in us, we should take Him as our person and live Him.<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; We need a proper understanding of what it means for Christ to live in us. It is rather easy to understand that Christ lives, but it is difficult to understand how Christ lives in us. For Christ to live in us does not mean that He lives instead of us. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, on the one hand, &#8220;no longer I,&#8221; and on the other hand, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in me&#8221; is of great importance. Yes, it is Christ who lives, but He lives in us.<p>In order to understand how Christ can live in us, we need to consider John 14. Before His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &#8220;Because I live, you shall live also&#8221; (v. 19). Christ lives in us by causing us to live with Him. Christ does not live alone; He lives in us and with us. He lives in us by enabling us to live with Him. In a very real sense, if we do not live with Him, He cannot live in us. We have not been altogether ruled out, and our life has not been exchanged for the divine life. We continue to exist, but we exist with the Triune God. The Triune God who now dwells within us causes us to live with Christ. Hence, Christ lives in us through our living with Him.<p>In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; The Son did not live by Himself. However, this does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist. The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life. Instead, He lived the life of the Father. In this way the Son and the Father had one life and one living. It is the same in our relationship with Christ today. We and Christ do not have two lives. We have one life and one living. We live by Him, and He lives in us. If we do not live, He does not live; and if He does not live, we cannot live. On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to exist, but we do not exist without Christ. Christ lives within us, and we live with Him. Therefore, we and He have one life and one living.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in Galatians 2:20 about Christ living in us is definite and emphatic. There is no ambiguity here. Paul clearly says that Christ, as a person, lives in us. This Christ who lives in us is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit. Now that He dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to learn how to let Him live in us and how to live together with Him. A normal believer is a person who has one life and one living with Christ. We are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17), we have one life with Him, and now we should be one person with Him. Sooner or later, those who seek the Lord realize that Someone divine, heavenly, eternal, and spiritual lives in them as a person. If we see this, we shall also see that just as He lived because of the Father, we should now live because of Him, taking Him as our person.<p>Paul could say not only that Christ lived in him, but also that to him to live was Christ (Phil. 1:21). On the one hand, Christ lived in Paul; on the other hand, Paul lived Christ. Inwardly Christ was Paul&#8217;s life, and outwardly Christ was Paul&#8217;s living. Paul and Christ thus had one life and one living. Christ&#8217;s life was Paul&#8217;s life, and Paul&#8217;s living was Christ&#8217;s living. The two, Christ and Paul, lived as one. First Corinthians 6:17 refers to such a living. In this verse Paul says that we are one spirit with the Lord. The organic union that has taken place between us and Christ causes us to be so close and intimate with Him that we are even one spirit with Him. If we would live Christ, we must take Him as our person and be one person with Him. He and we must be one in a practical way.<p>To live Christ is not merely to be holy, spiritual, and victorious. To live Christ is to live a person. We admit that the expression &#8220;live Christ&#8221; is new. We use this term deliberately. In our daily living we should simply live Christ. We should live a life that is Christ Himself.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that, as those who believe in Christ, we need to live Christ. We have seen that, according to John 6:57, we should live because of Him. Furthermore, according to John 14:19 and 20, we live in Christ in the way of coinherence. He lives in the Father, we live in Him, and He lives in us. We not only coexist with Christ; we coinhere with Him. This means that He lives in us and we live in Him. We have such a life of coinherence with Christ because He is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.<p>Christ lives in us so that we may live Him. We need to practice living Christ in all the details, particularly in the small things, of our daily life. I believe that this was Paul&#8217;s experience and practice. The books of Galatians and Philippians indicate that Paul was a person who practiced living Christ in all the small things. His desire was to be found in Christ by others (Phil. 3:9). This indicates that in all things, in every detail of his life, he practiced living Christ. For Paul, this was not a mere doctrine; it was also a fact. It should also be real and practical to us that Christ lives in us and that we live Him.<h2 class=head2>34. The One Being Formed within Them</h2><p>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, &#8220;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them when they were regenerated through Paul&#8217;s preaching the gospel to them the first time. The apostle then travailed again that Christ might be formed in them. Christ, a living person, was the focus of Paul&#8217;s gospel. His preaching was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers. Paul&#8217;s preaching was emphatically Christ-centered. According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us (1:16), He is now living in us (2:20), and He will be formed in us (4:29). To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full. First Christ was born into us at our conversion, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about Christ being formed in us implies that we are being constituted of Christ. To have Christ formed in us is a living, organic matter. Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted of Him organically. He intends to constitute our being-our mind, emotion, and will-of Himself. He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being. The word &#8220;formed&#8221; in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word &#8220;image&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into Christ&#8217;s image. This image is a form. Christ must be formed in us so that we may express Him by being in His image.<p>The indwelling Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution. This is transformation. In our thinking, for example, we should take Christ as our person. If we do this, His element will become part of the very constitution of our mind. Eventually, our entire being will be constituted of the element of Christ. As a result, our constitution will simply be Christ Himself.<p>The second stanza of #499 in Hymns speaks of Christ being formed in us:<p class=hbody>Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!<br>Christ now is being formed in me.<br>His very nature and life divine<br>In my whole being inwrought shall be.<br>All that I am came to an end,<br>And all of Christ is all to me.</p><p>This stanza of the hymn was written with Galatians 4:19 as the basis. For Christ to be formed within us means that His element is being constituted into our being. In other words, His being becomes our being, and His constitution becomes our constitution. This is not merely a matter of the element of Christ being within us but of having the element of Christ constituted into our being. To be constituted of Christ in this way involves a process of organic transformation and formation. In this process something living is being constituted into, wrought into, our being.<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ is deeply related to our being. This is not merely a concept, theory, or theology. This is a divine fact that we need to experience in full. It is a fact that Christ with His element dwells within us. As the living One, He with His element is working within us organically, constituting Himself into our being so that we may have His form and express His image. Paul travailed that Christ might be formed in the believers in this way.<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; Being transformed into Christ&#8217;s image from glory to glory is not a doctrine. Doctrine cannot transform us into Christ&#8217;s image. This transforming work can be accomplished only as our being is constituted of Christ&#8217;s living element. Then we can be transformed into His image. Our Christ today is the One who lives in us and also the One who is being formed in our being by constituting us of His divine element.<h2 class=head2>35. The One Making His Home in Their Hearts</h2><p>The Christ who lives in us and who is being formed in us is now making His home in our hearts. In Ephesians 3:17 Paul says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts.&#8221; The heart is the center of our being. In our hearts Christ is now making His home, that is, settling Himself. Therefore, Christ is not only in us, but He is making His home in us.<p>Our heart is composed of the three parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. Through regeneration, Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Now we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our hearts. The heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being. Therefore, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.<p>Christ desires to spread from our spirit to all the parts of our heart. We, however, may not always be willing for Him to spread into our mind, emotion, or will. Therefore, Paul prayed to the Father that He would strengthen us according to His power by His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts. This indicates that by being strengthened in this way, we shall be willing to let the indwelling Christ spread into all the parts of our being and to take over each part. This is Christ making His home in our hearts.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;make home&#8221; in Ephesians 3:17 is the word for house plus a prefix that means &#8220;down.&#8221; This indicates that Christ wants to make His home deep down in our being. When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit. Now we must give Him the opportunity to spread Himself throughout all the parts of our inner being. As we are strengthened into the inner man, the door is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit to every part of our mind, emotion, and will. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us. This means that He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts and saturating them with Himself. As a result, we are filled with Christ.<h2 class=head2>36. The One Magnified in Them</h2><p>Christ is also the One magnified in the believers. Paul said, &#8220;Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&#8221; (Phil. 1:20). In Paul&#8217;s bodily sufferings Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great (shown to be without limitation), exalted, and extolled. Therefore, to magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation. It is to show to the whole universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited. Paul&#8217;s sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. No matter what the circumstances were, Paul expected Christ to be magnified in him.<p>The word &#8220;magnify&#8221; means to make something large to our sight. We may wonder how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great. According to Ephesians 3:18, the dimensions of Christ-the breadth, length, height, and depth-are immeasurable, for they are the dimensions of the universe. Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the imperial guards of Caesar Christ was virtually nonexistent. In their eyes there was not such a person as Jesus Christ. However, Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison. As a result, through Paul&#8217;s magnification of Christ even some in Caesar&#8217;s household turned to Christ and were saved (Phil. 4:22). Although Christ is great, in the eyes of the Romans He was nothing. But as Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him appear great in the eyes of his captors. In our daily living we also should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others. We need to let others see Christ in the way of enlargement, in the way of magnification. According to the human concept, Christ is limited. But when others see us living Christ, they will realize that He is not limited. If Paul had not been put in prison, no one would have understood how unlimited Christ is. It was through Paul&#8217;s imprisonment that the Christ whom Paul lived was expressed as the unlimited One.<p>In Philippians 1:20 Paul says that Christ would be magnified in him whether through life or through death. No matter what faced him-the opportunity to go on living or martyrdom-Paul expected to magnify Christ. In his living Paul magnified Christ. This is to magnify Him through life. As he was expecting to be martyred, he also magnified Him. This is to magnify Christ through death. Thus, whether through life or through death, Christ was magnified through Paul&#8217;s body. Far from being exhausted by his imprisonment, Paul was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord. No doubt, he was shining forth Christ and expressing Him. Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ, a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible.<p>There is a crucial difference between natural human virtues and those virtues that are the magnification of Christ. For example, our love is eventually exhausted, but Christ as love is inexhaustible. The love that is the magnification of Christ lived by us is unlimited and cannot be exhausted. Likewise, our natural patience is limited, but Christ as our patience is without limit. We all have the capacity to be patient, but only to a certain extent. Although our natural patience is limited, Christ as patience is unlimited, inexhaustible, immeasurable.<p>Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ. In particular, Paul displayed Christ&#8217;s inexhaustible patience. Christ certainly was magnified in Paul&#8217;s body. Paul was happy in the Lord, and his happiness did not diminish as time went by. In his happiness he could show forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed. In this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ. He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure. While Paul was in prison, he expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way. He magnified Christ both through life and through death.<p>Now, as believers in Christ, we also should magnify Him. As Christ lives in us, is being formed in us, and makes His home in us, spontaneously we shall live Him. Then Christ will be magnified in us.<h2 class=head2>37. The One Empowering Them</h2><p>Christ is the One who empowers us. In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, &#8220;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&#8221; If we would experience Christ as the empowering One, we need to let Him live in us, be formed in us, make His home in us, and be magnified in us. If we fail to do these things, He will not have the way to empower us. But when Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him not only to strengthen us but to empower us.<p>To be empowered by Christ is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without. By such inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.<p>Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others (Phil. 3:9). In Philippians 4:13 he declared that he could do all things in Christ, the One who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word of Paul&#8217;s experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord&#8217;s word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5, &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221; As long as we have Christ and are in Him, we can do all things in Him.<p>The &#8220;all things&#8221; in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and the virtues listed in verse 8. This means that the application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13. By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of. This means that we are persons in Christ who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue. This is to live Christ, to magnify Christ in His virtues.<p>The six virtues mentioned in Philippians 4:8 are actually the image of God. God created man in His image, that is, in His attributes. God is love and light, and He is holy and righteous. These four things are God&#8217;s attributes which constitute the image of God. That man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The six items, whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of, are in these four divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is the real virtue, virtue that is the expression of Christ. Christ empowers the believers to live Him and magnify Him in all these virtues. Therefore, Paul&#8217;s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ&#8217;s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(36)</h1><p>In this message we are still on what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>38. The Treasure of Excellent Power</h2><p>We have seen that to the believers Christ is the One living within them so that they may live Him, that He is being formed within them, that He is making His home in their hearts, that He is the One magnified in them, and that He is the One empowering them. If we experience Christ in this way, we shall regard Him as most precious, as a treasure of excellent power.<p>Second Corinthians 4:6 and 7 say, &#8220;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;this treasure&#8221; in verse 7 refers to verse 6. Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous. God&#8217;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels. This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry. The excellence of the power, the divine power in resurrection, is surely of God and not of ourselves.<p>The indwelling Christ as our treasure is the divine source of the supply of the Christian life. By the excellent power of this treasure the believers are able to live a crucified life so that the resurrection life of Christ may be made manifest. Thus, the believers manifest the truth for the shining of the gospel.<p>The shining reality of Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels. Outwardly we are earthen vessels, but inwardly we have a priceless treasure. This treasure is Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God to be in us as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This treasure has a power, and this power is excellent. Christ as the life-giving Spirit in us is the One who shines and works. This is the treasure we have in us.<p>The Greek word translated &#8220;excellence&#8221; also means transcendence, surpassingness, exceeding greatness. The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellence of the power is of God and not of us. In ourselves we do not have the power to shine forth the glory of the gospel. The excellence of this power is of God. Although we are earthen vessels, God has shined Christ as a precious treasure into us. Now this treasure has become the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God&#8217;s glory and to manifest the truth. Therefore, as believers we have Christ operating within us as a living and active treasure. This treasure even constrains us to do certain things. This is Christ in His person as the treasure of excellent power.<h2 class=head2>39. The Depths of God</h2><p>First Corinthians 2:10 says, &#8220;The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&#8221; The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. These deep things have never arisen in man&#8217;s heart, but they are revealed to us in our spirit by God&#8217;s Spirit. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. Hence, we must be spiritual in order to partake of them. We must move and live in our spirit so that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us.<p>Christ Himself is the depths of God. Every genuine Christian knows that Christ is the Savior who died on the cross for our sins. However, to know Christ in this way is to know only superficial things. To know the depths of God is to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion. Christ is the center of God&#8217;s economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God. God&#8217;s wisdom in a mystery is Christ as the deep things of God. Therefore, the depths of God are Christ Himself as the mysterious and hidden wisdom, the focus of God&#8217;s economy, and the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God.<p>We may be believers and yet not know the depths of God. We need to know God according to His depths, knowing those matters which God regards as deep. If we would know the depths of God, the deep things of God, we need to know the books of Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, John, and Revelation. But not even these books, books that reveal deep and profound matters, tell us that Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, has become the life-giving Spirit. Only in 1 Corinthians 15:45 do we have such a statement. Moreover, only in 1 Corinthians does Paul say, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (6:17). What is deeper than this? What is deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit? These things are unfathomable; they are immeasurably deep and profound.<p>In order to know Christ as the depths of God, we need to know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus. Through His crucifixion the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and released the divine life that it might be imparted to all those who believe in Him. Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us. We have a mingled spirit within us, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. This is a very deep matter.<p>If we consider the context of the whole book of 1 Corinthians, we shall have the assurance to interpret the depths of God in 2:10 as referring to the all-inclusive Christ who, as the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit. After accomplishing redemption, this Christ became a life-giving Spirit. As such, He is so available to us that we are joined to Him as one spirit. Nothing is deeper than this.<p>When we enjoy Christ continually, we shall eventually enter into the depths of God&#8217;s being. Then we shall realize that we are in the very heart, the depths, of the almighty God, and that He is becoming our inner element. Then in Christ we shall be mingled with God. When we enjoy Christ, we touch the depths of God, and God becomes the element within us.<p>Christ is practical to us in our experience. He is not only our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30) but also the depths of God. Because our experience is limited, we are not able to explain adequately what it means for Christ to be the depths of God. But one day we shall advance in our experience and we shall truly know Him as God&#8217;s depths.<h2 class=head2>40. A Model</h2><p>First Peter 2:21 says, &#8220;Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.&#8221; The word &#8220;model&#8221; has been spoiled by common usage. Literally, the Greek word means a writing-copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them. In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing material, and those letters became a master copy. Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy. Then the children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy. The Greek word for model is the word that denotes such a master copy used in the teaching of writing. The Lord Jesus has set His life before us as an underwriting for us to copy by tracing and following His steps.<p>It is not God&#8217;s intention, however, that we try to imitate Christ by our own effort. We know from experience that trying to imitate Christ does not work. We are not able to imitate Him. What we need is not imitation, but reproduction. There is a great difference between imitation and reproduction. Outwardly Christ is our model, and inwardly He is our person, living in us, being formed in us, and making His home in us. Through this process we become a reproduction of the original, a reproduction of Christ as our model.<p>Christ is not merely a model for us to follow outwardly. He is a writing-copy, an original to be used for making many copies. We need to become Christ&#8217;s reproduction, copies of Christ, by experiencing a process that involves the riches of the divine life. When this process is completed, we shall become a reproduction of Christ. When anyone observes the expression of the Triune God from within a believer, this indicates that such a believer has become a reproduction of Christ, the model. The manner of life that expresses the processed Triune God is a reproduction of Christ.<p>As a model to the believers, Christ is the original used for making a reproduction of Himself. In order to understand Christ as our model, we need experience. From experience we know that as we enjoy Christ day by day, we are undergoing the process of spiritual reproduction to make us living copies of Christ.<p>To become the reproduction of Christ is very different from trying to imitate Him. To illustrate, a man may set an example for a monkey to stand upright, and the monkey stands up, imitating the man. Then the man walks, and the monkey imitates him by walking on two feet. But after the imitation is finished, the man leaves, and the monkey goes back to walking on all fours. At least to a certain extent, those teachers who instruct believers to imitate Christ are like a man training a monkey to imitate a human being. Trying to imitate Christ in such a way simply does not work. Therefore, I do not encourage you to imitate Christ. Instead, I would point you to His riches. I would point you to Him as the One living in us, being formed in us, and making His home in us so that we may undergo the process of becoming the reproduction of Christ as our model.<h2 class=head2>41. The Author and Finisher of Faith</h2><p>To us as believers Christ is the Author and Perfecter of faith. Hebrews 12:2 says, &#8220;Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;Author&#8221; may also be translated Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer, Forerunner. Christ is the Author of faith; He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source and cause of faith.<p>We need Christ as the Author of faith, because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability. The believing element is absent from our natural being. Naturally, we have only the unbelieving ability, not the ability to believe. Hence, the faith we have through which we have been saved is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8; 2 Pet. 1:1). When we look away unto Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit, dispenses Himself into us as the believing element. Then spontaneously the believing ability arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him.<p>If we would have faith, we must look away unto Jesus, the source of faith. When we look away from all other things unto Him, He radiates Himself into us, charging us with Himself. As a result, spontaneously we have faith, a faith that originates not with us but with Him. Faith is actually Christ Himself believing for us in a very subjective way. He transfuses us with Himself, working Himself into us, until He, the very person, becomes the believing element within us. Thus, it is not we who believe; it is He who believes within us. In this way, He makes us a believing being. Apparently it is our believing; actually it is Christ&#8217;s believing. This is genuine faith.<p>Once Christ has originated this faith within us, He will never let it go. Rather, He will complete, finish, and perfect it. Therefore, He is also the Perfecter of faith. The Greek word translated &#8220;Perfecter&#8221; in Hebrews 12:2 may also be rendered Finisher or Completer. Christ is the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. By looking unto Him continually, we shall have Him finish and complete the faith that He has originated by dispensing Himself as the believing element into us. It is crucial that, as believers, we look away from all things unto the Lord Jesus. When we look away unto Him, we give Him the opportunity to work Himself into every inward part of our being until we are saturated with Him. The more we are saturated with Him, the easier it is for us to believe. Because Christ as the believing element has been transfused into us and worked into us, we believe in the Lord automatically, without any effort or strife. This is the way to have faith. As believers, we all need to experience faith in such a subjective way by looking away unto Christ, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.<h2 class=head2>42. The Captain of Salvation</h2><p>Hebrews 2:10 says, &#8220;It was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.&#8221; The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, into His expression. In order to accomplish this, God needs an example, a model. Such a one would be the qualified Captain taking the lead to bring the many sons into glory. Christ is this Captain, the Captain of salvation. Before He became the Captain, however, He had to be perfected through sufferings. Although Christ was perfect before His incarnation, He did not have the experience of human suffering. It was necessary for Him to be perfected through suffering before He could become to the believers the Captain of salvation. The word &#8220;perfect&#8221; in Hebrews 2:10 means to carry to the end or consummation by completing or perfecting. To be perfect here actually means to be qualified. For Christ to be perfected by God does not imply any imperfection of virtue or attribute in the Lord Jesus, but only the completing of His experience of human sufferings which makes Him fit to become the Captain, the Leader, of His followers&#8217; salvation. Because Christ has been perfected through His experience of human sufferings in the flesh, He is qualified to fulfill the office of the Captain of our salvation. He has cut the way into glory, He has taken the lead to enter into glory, and He is now the Captain bringing the believers into the glory which He has already entered.<p>One day Christ, who is the example, model, and Captain came into us. He is not only our Savior; He is the One who took the lead to enter into glory, the One who has entered into the full expression of God, the One who, even today, is this full expression. This One, who is God&#8217;s expression, the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory (Heb. 1:3), is the Christ who has come into us. Therefore, Colossians 1:27 says, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; On the one hand, Christ is in the heavens dwelling in the expression of God. On the other hand, He dwells in us.<p>When the Captain of salvation came into us, the glory came with Him. In other words, the Captain of salvation came into us to be the glory within us. At the very least, He came in to be the seed of glory. Now, as believers, we have this seed of glory, the Captain of salvation Himself, within us. Because He passed through sufferings in order to enter into glory and because He is now fully qualified to fulfill the office of Captain, Christ could come into us both as the Captain and as the glory. Now as the Captain of salvation, Christ is leading an army of believers into glory. Every day He is leading us into glory, into the expression of God. While He is leading us into glory, He is the glory within us. Eventually, when our entire being has been saturated with the element of glory, the glory will come out of us, and we shall be brought by our Captain fully into the expression of God.<h2 class=head2>43. The Forerunner</h2><p>Hebrews 6:20 says that Christ is also the believers&#8217; Forerunner to enter into the veil. The book of Hebrews encourages the backsliding Hebrew believers to go forward to reach God&#8217;s goal. They were staggering in the Old Testament as in the outer court. The writer of Hebrews advises them to go on to reach God&#8217;s New Testament goal to enter into the veil, that is, to enter the Holy of Holies. For this, Christ has taken the lead, as a Forerunner, to enter into the veil that the believers may follow Him.<h2 class=head2>44. The Apostle</h2><p>To the believers Christ is also the Apostle. &#8220;Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus&#8221; (Heb. 3:1). The word &#8220;apostle&#8221; in Greek means a sent one, one who is sent by a higher authority. As our Apostle, Christ is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). God sent Christ to us as the Apostle to share God with us so that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. Moreover, as the Apostle Christ was sent to care for God&#8217;s house, the church, even to be the Builder of the house. Therefore, it is in the church as the house of God that we enjoy Christ as the faithful Apostle sent from God to us.<h2 class=head2>45. High Priest</h2><p>Hebrews 4:14 says, &#8220;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.&#8221; Christ was sent from God to us through incarnation to be our Apostle. Then He went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs.<p>The main function of Christ as the believers&#8217; High Priest is to minister God into them. We need our High Priest to minister God into us. We should forget our environment, weaknesses, troubles, and even ourselves and remember that Christ is our High Priest ministering to us.<p>According to the Old Testament, whenever the high priest went into the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, he bore upon his shoulders two onyx stones in which were engraved the names of the children of Israel (Exo. 28:9-12). He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel (Exo. 28:15-30). This signified that the people were on the shoulder and breast of the high priest. Now Christ, our High Priest in the Holy of Holies in the heavens, bears us before God. As He bears us in the presence of God, He ministers God into our being.<p>According to Hebrews 4:14, Christ is a great High Priest. The word &#8220;great&#8221; here means excellent, wonderful, glorious, most honorable. Christ today is an excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable High Priest. As such a great High Priest, He is great in His person, for He is both the Son of God and the Son of man. He is also great in His work and attainment. His attainment is so high that He has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and has been crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 6:19; 9:24; 2:9).<p>Hebrews 4:15 indicates that, as our High Priest, Christ has been tried in all respects like us but without sin. Because He has been tried, He is qualified and able to help us who are being tried (Heb. 2:18). Because He suffered trials without being touched by sin, He is equipped to help us pass through trials and to keep us from any entanglement of sin. Furthermore, as the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow-suffering with us. Whatever happens to us and whatever suffering we may have, He feels it with us and sympathizes with us.<p>More concerning Christ as the believers&#8217; High Priest is revealed in Hebrews 7. Christ&#8217;s priesthood is divine. For Him to be divine is a matter of constituent, a matter of His having the necessary, basic element that constitutes Him our High Priest. Christ&#8217;s divinity constitutes Him a High Priest who is living and full of life so that He may be able to continue His priesthood perpetually. With Christ as the divine High Priest there is no death, for He has conquered, subdued, and swallowed death. Wherever He is, there is life. Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ is fully equipped and qualified to be our High Priest. In this High Priest there is not only no sin but absolutely no death. Death has been completely swallowed up by His divine life.<p>Christ has not been constituted the High Priest according to the law of letters but according to the power of an indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Therefore, as our High Priest Christ takes care of us with His indestructible life. In His indestructible, eternal life we participate and enjoy Him as our High Priest.<p>Hebrews 7:25 tells us that our High Priest is able to save us to the uttermost. The Greek word translated &#8220;uttermost&#8221; also means completely, entirely, perfectly, for all time and eternity and to the end. Because Christ lives forever, He is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, time, and space.<p>Hebrews 7:25 indicates that Christ is able to save us to the uttermost because He is always living to intercede for us. As our High Priest, Christ undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God&#8217;s eternal purpose. He intercedes for us constantly, knowing how easy it is for us to fall and, once we have fallen, to remain in our fallen state. Truly we are saved by His intercession. God has appointed Christ to take care of us, and He is now caring for us by interceding for us. He is interceding for us, and He will save us to the uttermost.<p>Hebrews 7:26 says, &#8220;Such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens.&#8221; As the One who is holy, guileless, undefiled, and separated from sinners, Christ is the perfect One, and He surely befits us. Moreover, in His ascension He has passed through the heavens. Now He is not only in heaven but is also higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens (Eph. 4:10). Because our High Priest is higher than the heavens, He is able to rescue us and save us to the uttermost.<h2 class=head2>46. Husband</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, &#8220;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&#8221; Here we see that Christ is the believers&#8217; Husband, the unique Husband for us to love. We should belong only to Him, and we should appreciate Him and love Him. As our Husband, Christ has attracted us, and we have been presented as a pure virgin to Him. Now we should care only for Him, allowing nothing to replace Him in our hearts. Our love for Him should be pure, and our whole being should be focused on Him.<h2 class=head2>47. Bridegroom</h2><p>The word of John the Baptist in John 3:29 indicates that to the believers Christ is the Bridegroom: &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; The bridegroom is a most pleasant person, who comes for the bride. The believers as a corporate bride are prepared for Christ. To us He should be the attraction, the pleasure, and the satisfaction. All the believers should enjoy Him as such a pleasant Bridegroom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(37)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.<h2 class=head2>48. Head</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul says, &#8220;I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&#8221; In Ephesians 1:22 and 23 the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. Here in 1 Corinthians 11:3 the headship of Christ over every man is pertaining to individuals. Christ is both the Head corporately of the Body, the church, and individually of the believers. He is the Head directly of every one of us.<p>We may link Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 11:3 to the book of Revelation. According to Revelation 4 and 5, Christ, the slain, resurrected, and ascended Lamb, is now in the heavens carrying out God&#8217;s administration under God&#8217;s headship. Before the throne of God, there is no rebellion. However, the earth is filled with rebellion. Satan takes the lead to rebel against God. But in the midst of all this rebellion, there is a Body composed of believers who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God, the Body of the One in heaven who submits Himself to God&#8217;s headship. The believers should reflect Christ as the Head submitting Himself to the headship of God. Christ is the One who became a man, who was slain for our sins, and who was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit so that we may have life. Now this One is in the heavens submitting Himself to God&#8217;s headship for the carrying out of the divine administration. We, therefore, by honoring Christ as our Head, should express Christ&#8217;s submission to the headship of God for the carrying out of His administration.<h2 class=head2>49. Lord</h2><p>As believers, we have Christ as our Lord. Romans 14:8 says, &#8220;Whether we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord&#8217;s.&#8221; All genuine believers are the Lord&#8217;s. All have been born of the same Lord regardless of the way in which they have been baptized, of the food they eat, or the days they observe. Because Christ is our Lord, we should not make decisions on our own. Furthermore, we should not make suggestions to others or give instructions to them, for Christ is their Lord. Only the Lord Jesus is the Lord. We must honor Him by not making decisions in ourselves. We should realize that He is our Lord and that we are not qualified and do not have the position to make decisions. If we know that Christ is our Lord, and the Lord of all believers, we shall honor Him by praying and waiting on Him for His leading.<p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul speaks of &#8220;our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; We the believers should not only recognize Christ as the Lord; we should take Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately. He is the Lord of all things and of all people. That is general. We should take Him specifically as our Lord in our experience of salvation and our Christian life. In our daily life we should always realize that we have a Lord who is the Christ of God.<h2 class=head2>50. Master (Lord)</h2><p>Paul&#8217;s word concerning the relationship between slaves and masters (Eph. 6:5-9) reveals that Christ is the believers&#8217; Master, Lord. Paul exhorts the slaves to obey their masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ (v. 5). Fear is the inward motive and trembling is the outward attitude. Singleness means to be pure in motive, with only a single purpose. Slaves are to be single; they are not to have a double purpose. This means that slaves are not to serve their masters with the intention of receiving some gain for themselves. Here the relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master. We should obey Him as slaves, in singleness of heart.<p>Ephesians 6:9 says, &#8220;The masters, do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.&#8221; This indicates that the masters who had the right over the lives of their purchased slaves should give up threatening, because the Lord is the real Master of both them and the slaves. In the flesh, some may be slaves, and others may be masters. But in the eyes of the Lord, there is no difference between slaves and masters. He is our unique Master, our Lord, and we are all His slaves.<h2 class=head2>51. Master (Sovereign Lord)</h2><p>To the believers Christ is also the Master as their Sovereign Lord. Second Peter 2:1 speaks of Christ as the Master who bought us, referring both to Christ&#8217;s person and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers. Jude 4 speaks of &#8220;our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;Master&#8221; in this verse is despotes, which denotes one who is the absolute owner and who has unlimited power over another.<h2 class=head2>52. Friend</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word in John 15:15 indicates that He is a Friend to the believers: &#8220;No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his lord is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard from My Father, I have made known to you.&#8221; John 15:13-15 indicates that as branches we have an intimate relationship with the vine. The branches are not the Lord&#8217;s slaves; they are His friends, and He is a Friend to them. Because the branches are the Lord&#8217;s friends, they can know the Father&#8217;s desire to be expressed, glorified, in a corporate Body. What the Lord has heard directly from the Father He has made known to His friends.<h2 class=head2>53. Brother</h2><p>As believers in Christ, we have Christ as our Brother. Romans 8:29 says that those whom God foreknew &#8220;He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; God&#8217;s purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son. Therefore, we have been predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of the Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers. Christ, the believers&#8217; Brother, is the model and pattern for all His brothers, who will be conformed to His image. He, the Firstborn, is the prototype, and we, the believers as His many brothers, are the mass production.<p>God&#8217;s purpose is to have many brothers of His firstborn Son. When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique. But God desires to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son. In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons. God&#8217;s purpose in having many sons is that we express Him in a corporate way. God&#8217;s kingdom is built up with His many sons, and the Body of Christ is built up with His many brothers. Without the many sons God cannot have a kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ cannot have a Body. Thus, the many sons of God are for the kingdom of God, and the many brothers of Christ are for the Body of Christ. The kingdom of God is the Body life, and the Body life in the church is God&#8217;s kingdom where He is expressed and where His dominion is exercised on earth. This is God&#8217;s purpose in producing us as the brothers of Christ.<p>Through the process of conformation, the firstborn Son will have many brothers. As the Son of God in eternity, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son. Now through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ has become the Firstborn, and the believers have become His many brothers who are being conformed to His image for God&#8217;s expression.<p>On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus said to Mary, &#8220;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&#8221; (John 20:17). Before His resurrection, the Lord never called His disciples brothers. But now, after His resurrection, they have become His brothers. Through His resurrection the disciples have been regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) with the divine life released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in John 12:24. First Peter 1:3 says that we were regenerated through Christ&#8217;s resurrection. It was through His resurrection that Christ imparted Himself as the Spirit into His disciples. By receiving His life, they were reborn and became His brothers. Now the believers are brothers of Christ because they have the same life as He.<p>In His resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son, became the Firstborn among many brothers. These many brothers are those who have been regenerated through the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. This was the reason the Lord said to Mary, &#8220;Go to My brothers.&#8221; These many brothers are the propagation of the Father&#8217;s life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life. Hence, in Christ&#8217;s resurrection God&#8217;s purpose is fulfilled.<p>Hebrews 2:11 says, &#8220;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&#8221; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. The &#8220;one&#8221; here refers to the Father. The Son, who is the Sanctifier, and we, who are being sanctified, are all of one Father. Both the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God were born of the same Father God in resurrection. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in the divine life and nature. Therefore, Christ is not ashamed to call them brothers. Because Christ and the believers are of the same source and have the same life with the same nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers.<p>Through His life-imparting death and resurrection, Christ has made the believers one with Him. Now His Father is also the believers&#8217; Father, and His God is their God. Through Christ&#8217;s resurrection we have received the Father&#8217;s life and nature. By making us His brothers, Christ has imparted the Father&#8217;s life and nature into us. By making His Father and God ours, He has brought us into His position-the Son&#8217;s position-before the Father so that we may partake of the Father in resurrection. Therefore, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly, Christ and His many brothers are the same. The Father is not only the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ; He is also the Father of the believers. We, the many brothers, are the same as the Firstborn, and He is the same as we are.<p>Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is our elder Brother. As such, He is our model and example. Because He is our elder Brother, He takes the lead in everything, and we follow in His footsteps.<h2 class=head2>54. Partner</h2><p>Hebrews 1:9 and 3:14 reveal that Christ is our Partner. Hebrews 1:9 says, &#8220;God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.&#8221; In God&#8217;s economy Christ is God&#8217;s appointed One to accomplish God&#8217;s plan, and we are Christ&#8217;s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose.<p>God&#8217;s operation in the universe is to accomplish a glorious expression of Himself. For the accomplishment of this plan, Christ was appointed in eternity past and anointed in time. God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed One, anointing Him to be the accomplisher of God&#8217;s operation. As partners of Christ, we are partners in His anointing. He has obtained the anointing, and we share it with Him. Therefore, we are partners of Christ, sharing in the accomplishment of God&#8217;s operation. Christ will accomplish a full expression of God in glory, and we are cooperating with Him in this operation.<p>Hebrews 3:14 says, &#8220;We have become partners of the Christ.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;partners&#8221; here as in 1:9, is metochos, the same word for &#8220;partakers&#8221; in Hebrews 3:1; 6:4; and 12:8. In those three places it means that we share in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the discipline; therefore, we use the word partakers. In 3:14 and 1:9 it means that we share with Christ; therefore, we use the word partners. A partaker is different from a partner. We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline. We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing as the members share with the Head the Spirit, and sharing with Him the heavenly rest as Caleb shared with Joshua the rest of the good land (Num. 14:30).<p>According to the context, metochos in 3:14 should be translated partners. The portion from 3:7 through 3:14 deals with entering into the good land. The type of this entering was the entering into the good land under the leadership of Joshua. Joshua entered into the land of Canaan, and Caleb was his comrade, companion, and partner in entering into and possessing this good land. Today Christ is our Joshua, and we should be His Calebs. In this respect, we are Christ&#8217;s partners, not His partakers. When we enjoy Christ, we are His partakers. When we follow Him, we are His partners. As His partners, we are working together with Him, cooperating with Him. Being a partaker is for the purpose of being a partner. As partakers of Christ, we partake of His riches and nourishment. After we have enjoyed Him in this way, in our experience He becomes the Captain who takes the lead, and we follow Him as His partners. When He marches, we march with Him. He is the Captain, and we are the army. By following Christ as His partners, we shall enter into His rest (Heb. 4:8-9) and shall be brought into His glory (Heb. 2:10).<h2 class=head2>55. Physician</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 9:12 reveals that He is our Physician: &#8220;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.&#8221; According to the context, the Lord was telling the Pharisees that the tax collectors and sinners were patients, sick ones, and that to them He was not a judge but a physician, a healer. In calling people to follow Him, Christ ministered as a physician. The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace. Had the Lord visited the people as a judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be His followers. Therefore, He came to minister as a physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them so that they might be reconstituted to be the members of His Body.<p>As our Physician, the Lord heals us mainly in our spirit and our soul, not in our body. The tax collectors and sinners in Matthew 9 were not physically sick; they were spiritually sick. While the Lord Jesus was feasting with them, He was healing them spiritually. Likewise, although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul.<p>Paul&#8217;s experience in his later ministry helps us to have a proper appreciation of Christ as the believers&#8217; Physician. In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul says, &#8220;Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&#8221; Why did the apostle leave such an intimate one in sickness without exercising healing prayer for him? Why did he not also execute his healing gift (Acts 19:11-12) to cure Timothy of his stomach illness rather than instruct him to take the natural way for healing (1 Tim. 5:23)? It may appear to some that in caring for Timothy&#8217;s ailment and Trophimus&#8217; sickness in a human way Paul acted as if he were an unbeliever. There is no record that he prayed for healing, and he certainly did not exercise the gift of healing. Instead, Paul encouraged Timothy to take a little wine, and he left Trophimus at Miletus. Paul cared for his co-workers in a very human way. The reason Paul cared for them in this way is that, in a time of suffering, Paul and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is of grace in life; the latter of gift in power, miraculous power. Paul&#8217;s experience should help us to see that, for the most part, Christ&#8217;s healing today is for the spirit and the soul. Christ is the believers&#8217; Physician, the Healer of our spirit, our soul, and at times, also of our body. If we see this vision we shall trust in Him and experience Him as our Physician.<h2 class=head2>56. Helper</h2><p>Hebrews 13:5 says that our way of life should be without love of money and that we should be satisfied with our circumstances, for the Lord upholds us and will by no means forsake us. &#8220;So that, being of good courage we say, the Lord is my Helper&#8221; (v. 6). We should be satisfied with whatever we have and with whatever circumstances we are in, knowing that we have the Lord and that we can trust in Him for our living. Because we have Christ as our Helper, we should be content and at peace. The Lord knows our need. Therefore, we may have the assurance to sacrifice everything for Him and for the church life without worrying about our living. The Lord will take care of our needs. He is our Helper and He never forsakes us. Our life is in Him, and our living is in His hands.<h2 class=head2>57. Overseer</h2><p>In 1 Peter 2:25 we see that Christ is the Overseer of our souls. As believers, we have Christ as an Overseer, as an Elder. The New Testament reveals that an overseer is an elder and that an elder is an overseer. The Greek word for overseer means one who oversees a particular condition or situation. This word seems to indicate someone above us who takes oversight concerning us and watches what we are doing. However, the Lord as the Overseer is the One who cares for us. For Him to oversee us means that He takes care of us. As the Overseer, the Lord does not govern us or rule over us. Instead, He cares for us as a mother cares for her child. A mother oversees her child with the purpose of caring for the child, wanting to take care of every need. The same is true of Christ as our Overseer.<p>According to 1 Peter 2:25 Christ is the Overseer of our souls. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Christ as the Overseer of our souls cares for the welfare of our inner being and exercises His oversight over the condition of our real person.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(38)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider what Christ is in His person in the church.<h2 class=head1>U. IN THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Rock as the Foundation</h2><p>In the church Christ is the rock as the foundation on which the church is built. After Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), the Lord said, &#8220;On this rock I will build My church&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). Roman Catholicism claims that &#8220;the rock&#8221; here refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ. Although it is correct to say that the rock denotes Christ, not even this understanding is adequate. The rock here refers not only to Christ but also to the revelation concerning Christ. First, this rock refers to Christ Himself as the Son of the living God. Second, this rock refers to the revelation of Christ which Peter received from the Father. This heavenly revelation is the rock. When we see this revelation concerning Christ, it becomes the rock. Therefore, the church is built both upon Christ and the revelation concerning Christ.<p>The church that is built upon the rock of Christ and the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian. However, the problem is that Christians form groups or so-called churches according to their concept and viewpoint. But their concept is not the revelation concerning Christ. The church must be built upon the rock, that is, upon Christ and the revelation of Him. If we see this, we shall be saved from division. Only one thing is built upon Christ as the rock, and this is the church. Any group that is built upon doctrines, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon Christ and the revelation concerning Christ.<p>As the rock upon which the church is built, Christ is the unique foundation of the church. &#8220;Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:11). As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church. No one should lay any other foundation.<p>We know from 1 Corinthians 3:11 that Christ is the unique foundation for the church as God&#8217;s building. Nevertheless, certain of the believers at Corinth were taking Paul, Apollos, or Cephas as their foundation. When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing. In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asks them, &#8220;Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?&#8221; By asking these questions Paul was pointing out that he was not the unique foundation. On the contrary, Paul says in 3:10, &#8220;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation.&#8221; The unique foundation is not Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or any one or anything other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<p>The problem among the Corinthians was that they were trying to lay many other foundations. We see in chapter fourteen that, for some, speaking in tongues was a foundation. This indicates that it is possible for a particular practice to become a foundation. Therefore, Paul wanted the believers at Corinth to realize that he had already laid the unique foundation, Jesus Christ.<p>It is common for Christians today to lay foundations other than Christ as the unique foundation. For example, when someone declares that he is for immersion, he is laying immersion as a foundation. The same is true of someone who is for tongue-speaking. Whenever you claim to be for a particular person, doctrine, or practice, you are laying another foundation. To lay a foundation other than Christ ruins the Body life and damages God&#8217;s building. Instead of laying another foundation, we must build upon the foundation already laid. According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 9, Christ is our common portion, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ. This Christ, God&#8217;s unique center and our unique portion, is the unique foundation. This means that we must build upon the unique Christ. We should understand this not only doctrinally but also practically and experientially.<p>If we touch the depth of the truth in 1 Corinthians 3:11 and understand this verse according to its context and background, we shall see a vision of Christ as the unique foundation of the church. This vision, this truth, will then govern and control us. &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint&#8221; (Prov. 29:18, ASV). Among the vast majority of Christians today, there is no governing, restraining vision of Christ as the unique foundation. On the one hand, many refer to Paul&#8217;s word concerning Christ as the foundation; on the other hand, even while speaking of this verse, they are laying another foundation. From this we see that we need to understand 1 Corinthians 3:11 not merely in a doctrinal way but in a way that is very practical. We should never say that we are of a certain person or a certain thing or that we prefer a certain matter. To speak in this way is to lay another foundation in addition to Christ. Instead of laying another foundation, we should build upon the foundation already laid.<p>The church&#8217;s foundation is Christ, revealed and ministered through the apostles and prophets. Ephesians 2:20 speaks of the foundation of the apostles and prophets. This foundation is the Christ whom they ministered to others. The Christ who is the foundation of the church is the unique Christ revealed and ministered by the early apostles, as recorded in the New Testament. We must stay with this Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. The Head of the Body</h2><p>Christ is the Head of the Body. &#8220;Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body&#8221; (Eph. 5:23). In addition to being the Savior of the Body, Christ is also the Head of the church. The Savior is a matter of love, whereas the Head is a matter of authority. We love Christ as our Savior, but we must also be subject to Him as our Head.<p>As the Head of the church, His Body, Christ certainly is joined to the Body. Just as in one&#8217;s physical body the head and the body are one, so Christ, the Head, and the church, His Body, are joined and therefore are one. The Body is one with the Head in the divine life and in the divine Spirit.<p>All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body (Eph. 1:22-23). This means that what the Head has gained now belongs to the Body, for it is transmitted to the Body. The Body, therefore, comes into existence from the transmission of the Head. Whatever Christ has passed through, obtained, and attained is now being transmitted into the Body.<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &#8220;He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead.&#8221; The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection. Before His resurrection, Christ was not yet the Head of the Body. Ephesians 1 indicates that after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church. Hence, Christ&#8217;s headship is in resurrection. Because Christ&#8217;s headship is in resurrection, the enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being.<p>Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God (Col. 2:19). For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head. If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we shall not be separated from Him by anything. We shall remain in Him without any insulation between us and Him.<p>The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head. If we do not receive the supply that comes from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow. But when the Body is supplied by holding the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God. The Body grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head.<h2 class=head2>3. The Body</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:12 reveals that in the church Christ is not only the Head but also the Body: &#8220;As the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.&#8221; Christ here is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ. In Greek &#8220;Christ&#8221; in this verse is &#8220;the Christ,&#8221; referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members. All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to become His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body. As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ.<p>As a vine includes not only the stock but also the branches, so the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, includes not only Christ Himself but also the members of Christ&#8217;s Body, who are the members of Christ, parts of Christ. According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ&#8217;s Body. Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us parts of Him. Therefore, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our being.<p>In order to become the Body, even the Body-Christ, Christ had to pass through the steps of a process. First He, the very God, became flesh for our redemption. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and work within us. In this way He becomes the Body-Christ. Now in the church life we enjoy not only God, the Redeemer, and the life-giving Spirit but also the Christ who is the Body. When we come together, we share Christ with one another, and the corporate Christ comes forth. The coming forth of the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, depends on our speaking Him forth in the meetings. When we speak Christ, Christ comes forth in our speaking. If we all speak forth Christ, then the corporate Christ will come forth. This is the practicality of Christ as the Body.<h2 class=head2>4. Every Member of the New Man</h2><p>In the church Christ is every member of the new man. Colossians 3:11 says, &#8220;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; The word &#8220;where&#8221; referring to the new man in Colossians 3:10 means in the new man. There is no natural person in the new man. Furthermore, there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person. There cannot be Greeks, who are for philosophical wisdom, and Jews, who are for miraculous signs (1 Cor. 1:22). There cannot be circumcision, those who observe Jewish religious rituals, and uncircumcision, those who do not care for Jewish religion. Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be barbarian, Scythian, slave, or freeman. A barbarian is an uncultured person, the Scythians were considered the most barbarous people, the slaves were those sold into slavery, and the freemen were those who had been freed from slavery. No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies. In the new man there is room only for Christ, not for any kind of natural person, because Christ replaces with Himself the natural life of every member of the new man.<p>According to Colossians 3:10 and 11, in the new man Christ is all and in all. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. He is every part of the new man and in every part. Actually, He is the new man. In the new man Christ is the centrality and universality.<p>The word &#8220;all&#8221; in verse 11 refers to all the members who make up the new man. Christ is all the members and He is in all the members. For this reason, in the church there is no room for us. There is no room for any nationality. Because Christ is all and in all in the new man and we are parts of the new man, then we are parts of Christ. Each member, each part, of the new man is Christ. No doubt, the new man is a corporate man, the church, Christ&#8217;s Body. Although many different kinds of people make up the church, all are parts of Christ. They are no longer the natural person. Christ ieveryone in the new man, and He is in everyone in the new man. It is crucial for us to see that in the new man Christ is all and in all.<p>In the new man Christ is every member. Concerning this, Paul says that Christ is all. This means that in the new man there is no place for any natural person. There is no place for regional, cultural, or national distinctions. There is no room for any race, nationality, culture, or social status. In the new man there is room only for Christ. Christ surely is all the members of the new man. For this to be a reality, we must take Christ as our life and live Him, not ourselves. If Christ is the living of all the believers, then only He will be in the new man. All the members, whatever their nationality may be, will live Christ. Then in a way that is real and practical Christ will be all the members of the new man. Because we all live Christ, not ourselves, Christ will be all of us, every member of the new man.<p>In Colossians 3:11 Paul says not only that Christ is all but also that He is in all. On the one hand, Christ is all the members, and on the other hand, He is in all the members. Since Paul says that Christ is all, why is there the need for him to add that Christ is in all? If Paul had not said that Christ is in all, only that He is all, we might think that in the new man Christ is needed and that we are not needed. We should not think that, because Christ is all the members in the new man, we are not needed. The Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person, because Christ is all the members. Nevertheless, Paul says that Christ is in the members. The fact that Christ is in the members of the new man indicates that the members still exist. When we take Christ as our life and live together with Him, we are one with Christ and Christ is us. Simultaneously, Christ is in us. Therefore, it is true to say that Christ is both in us and that He is us. We are parts of the new man with Christ in us. We continue to exist, but we do not exist without Christ; we are indwelt by Christ. Therefore, in the new man Christ is both all the members and is in all the members.<p>The desire of God&#8217;s heart is to have the new man, which is constituted of the Christ who is our life (Col. 3:4). If we take Christ as our life and live Him, the new man will be expressed to satisfy God&#8217;s desire. Ultimately, the Christ we experience and enjoy becomes the constituent of the new man. In this new man, the Body, the church, Christ is all and in all.<h2 class=head2>5. The Builder of the Church</h2><p>Christ is the Builder of the church. In Matthew 16:18 He said, &#8220;I will build My church.&#8221; The words &#8220;My church&#8221; indicate that the church is of the Lord, not of any other person or thing. After the Lord Jesus had accomplished redemption, had resurrected from the dead, and had ascended to the heavens, the building of the church began.<p>The Lord Jesus has two natures: humanity, which is good for the material for the building of the church, and divinity, which is the element of the Builder. In His humanity Christ is the material for God&#8217;s building, and in His divinity He is the Builder. He builds the church with His person, divine and human, with whatever He has gone through, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and with what He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, through Himself as the life-giving Spirit. He does not build the church directly, but indirectly through His chosen apostles and other gifts (Eph. 4:11-12), and even through all the members of His Body (Eph. 4:16). The believers should enjoy Him as the Builder of the church to take Him with all that He is, has, and accomplishes through the gifted persons and even through all His members.<h2 class=head2>6. The Lord Distributing the Ministries</h2><p>In the church Christ is also the Lord distributing the ministries. &#8220;There are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:5). The Greek word translated &#8220;ministries&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;services.&#8221; The gifts in verse 4 are for these services, and they are for the operations in verse 6.<p>Because the Lord distributes the ministries, when we function we should have the realization that the source of our function and ministry is the Lord Himself. Our ministry and function must be under His distribution, which is a matter of the divine dispensing. In order to distribute the ministries and functions to His members, Christ dispenses Himself into them. Therefore, we need to live under Christ&#8217;s dispensing. If we live under this dispensing, then in the meetings we shall certainly be motivated by His inward dispensing to minister, to function, to do something that will render nourishment, edification, or building up to all the members.<h2 class=head2>7. The Sanctifier and the Cleanser</h2><p>According to Ephesians 5:25 and 26 Christ gave Himself up for the church that &#8220;He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.&#8221; Here we see that in the church Christ is the Sanctifier and the Cleanser. The purpose of Christ giving Himself to the church is to sanctify her, not only separating her to Himself from anything common but also saturating her with Himself so that she may be His counterpart. This is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the word. In sanctifying the church, Christ first washes away our sins with His blood (Heb. 13:12) and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. We are now in such a washing process in order that the church may be holy and without blemish.<p>In order to know Christ as the Sanctifier and also to know the meaning of sanctification, we need to contact the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. One aspect of sanctification involves separation. To be sanctified is to be separated positionally, to undergo a change of position. However, this is not the only aspect of sanctification. In sanctification something that was once natural gradually becomes holy in nature. Hence, as we are sanctified by Christ subjectively, we become holy dispositionally. Therefore, sanctification does not mean merely to be separated from what is common; it also means to have the very element of Christ added to us. Christ desires to saturate our whole being with Himself. Hence, He is sanctifying us subjectively by dispensing His element into our being.<p>In subjective sanctification something of Christ is added to us, but in cleansing something of us, especially our natural disposition, is subtracted. As we are cleansed, our natural disposition is washed away. Disposition is the most inward aspect of our constitution; it is the very root of our being. We were born with a certain disposition. Disposition, therefore, is altogether inward. As Christ is adding His element into us, He is also cleansing us and subtracting our natural disposition. His cleansing washes away the natural element from the depths of our being. The Christ who is the Cleanser is not the objective Christ in the heavens but the subjective Christ, the Christ who is intimate and available. As the Sanctifier and the Cleanser, He dispenses Himself into us. As His element is being added to us, something of ourselves is being removed. Therefore, on the one hand, we have the addition of Christ, but, on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition. Gradually, Christ is being added into our being, and our natural disposition is being subtracted. The result of this process is transformation, a metabolic change in which the new element is constituted into us and the old element is carried away.<p>The Christ who is the Sanctifier and the Cleanser is the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit in our spirit, He is sanctifying us and cleansing us. He sanctifies us by dispensing His element into us. As we open to Him for His dispensing, He will work within us as the life-giving Spirit to add Himself to us and to carry away our natural disposition. This is the living, subjective Christ as the Sanctifier and the Cleanser in the church.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(39)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further what Christ is in His person in the church. Then we shall go on to see Christ in God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head2>8. The Nourisher and the Cherisher</h2><p>Ephesians 5:29 tells us that Christ nourishes and cherishes the church. This reveals that in the church Christ is the Nourisher and the Cherisher. To nourish is to feed. When we are nourished, something enters into our being to meet our need. Nourishment, therefore, must come out of a supply. Without a supply, it is impossible to have nourishment.<p>Christ nourishes the church with all the riches of the Father. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). Hence, all the riches of God are in Christ, and He enjoys these riches. Then He nourishes the church with the very riches of the Godhead that He Himself has enjoyed. This is proved by John 15, where the Lord Jesus says that He is the vine, that the Father is the husbandman, and that we, the believers in Christ, are the branches. The vine nourishes the branches with what the vine absorbs from the soil. God the Father is the soil, the water, and everything to Christ as the vine. The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches. This is nourishing. Christ nourishes the church with the riches of the Father that He has absorbed and assimilated. By nourishing the church in this way Christ meets the inward need of the church.<p>It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and His word. But neither His life nor His word is the source. The source is the Father. What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and life supply that are embodied in the Word. For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life, or the supply of life. If we would be nourished by Christ, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and life supply. In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply. The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing.<p>As we are nourished by Christ, we are cleansed and transformed. The nourishment we receive makes the cleansing possible. If the nourishment ceases, the cleansing will cease also. But if we continually take in the spiritual supply, the elements we absorb into our being will cleanse us inwardly. The more we come to the Word, the more we are nourished. The nourishment we receive brings about an inner cleansing from the defects caused by the natural life.<p>Only by experiencing Christ&#8217;s nourishing can we endure the Lord&#8217;s metabolic cleansing of our disposition. Any cleansing that is not accompanied by nourishment is not genuine. Whenever we try to cleanse ourselves, we shall have the sense of spiritual starvation. But if Christ does the cleansing, He will supply the nourishment, and we shall enjoy sweet satisfaction. The more the Lord purifies us, the more of His nourishment we receive. Instead of suffering under the process of purification, we enjoy Christ and His abundant life supply.<p>Christ&#8217;s nourishing of the church also causes transformation. We become what we eat. This means that if we eat Christ, we shall eventually be constituted of Christ. We shall be transformed by the element of Christ that has been dispensed into us. Through Christ&#8217;s nourishment we are transformed and thereby become a new person with a new element and substance.<p>Christ&#8217;s care of the church includes cherishing as well as nourishing. &#8220;Cherish&#8221; is a word of utmost tenderness. To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. As the Lord nourishes us, He cherishes us. He is like a mother who cherishes her child even as she feeds him. How the little ones enjoy the warmth and comfort of their mothers! When the Lord nourishes us, He cherishes us with His tender warmth. His cherishing comforts us, soothes us, and calms us.<p>To be cherished is to be softened by being warmed. When we are hard and cold, we need Christ to cherish us. We need Him to warm our hearts. After some experience of His warming, we are softened. Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him. How tender, sweet, and warm the Lord Jesus is! By resting on Him, we who once were hard and cold become soft and warm. Such a change takes place through Christ&#8217;s care for us from within. He warms us and softens us as we enjoy His tenderness, sweetness, and lovingness. Christ truly is the cherishing One.<p>Christ&#8217;s presence in the church produces an atmosphere of tenderness and warmth to cherish our very being. For this reason, in the church we enjoy the atmosphere of the Lord&#8217;s cherishing. Actually, it is by the atmosphere produced by His brooding presence that Christ cherishes the church. When we are in this atmosphere we experience the rest, warmth, comfort, and encouragement that come from Christ&#8217;s cherishing of the church.<h2 class=head2>9. The High Priest Dressing the Lamps in the Sanctuary</h2><p>In Revelation 1:13-16 we see that Christ is the High Priest dressing the lamps (cf. Exo. 30:7). Christ today is in the midst of the churches (Rev. 1:13). On the one hand, He is the High Priest in the heavens interceding for the churches (Heb. 9:24; 7:25-26; Rom. 8:34). On the other hand, He is the High Priest among the churches taking care of them.<p>The fact that Christ is &#8220;clothed with a garment reaching to the feet&#8221; proves that He is a Priest, for this garment is a priestly robe (Exo. 28:33-35). Today Christ is exercising a priestly care for the churches. Furthermore, He is &#8220;girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.&#8221; It is interesting to note that He is not girded about the loins but about the breast. This indicates that His work has been accomplished and that now He is exercising a loving care for His beloved churches, even rebuking and chastising them in love. He is the loving High Priest walking among His churches and caring for them.<p>In the Old Testament the priests did four main things. They offered the sacrifices, arranged the show bread, dressed the lamps, and burned the incense. To dress the lamps included two matters: filling the lamps with oil and snuffing the wick. To snuff the wick means to cut off the burned part of the wick. Because the sacrificial work of Christ was accomplished on the cross, now He is not at the altar but among the lampstands, that is, in the sanctuary. He no longer needs to offer the sacrifices, but He does need to dress the lampstands by filling them with oil and snuffing the burned wick. He still has a heart of concern to care for all the shining lampstands. He is the Priest to supply the oil and to snuff the waste. He is doing this today among the churches. While He is praying for us, He is trimming us. He knows how much trimming the churches need.<h2 class=head2>10. The Holder of the Messengers of the Churches</h2><p>Christ is the Holder of the messengers of the churches. Revelation 1:16 says, &#8220;He had in His right hand seven stars,&#8221; and, as verse 20 makes clear, &#8220;the seven stars are messengers of the seven churches.&#8221; These messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus. Like stars, they should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the operation of the local churches (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Titus 1:5). The eldership is somewhat official. Furthermore, at the time the book of Revelation was written, the offices in the churches had deteriorated in the degradation of the church. Therefore, in this book the Lord calls our attention back to spiritual reality. For this reason Revelation emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church&#8217;s degradation.<p>Both the lampstands and the stars are for shining at night. A lampstand representing a local church is a collective unit, whereas a star representing a messenger of a local church is an individual entity. In the dark night of the church&#8217;s degradation there is the need of the shining both of the collective churches and of the individual messengers. As Christ walks among the churches, He holds the leading ones in His right hand. The leading ones should be comforted by the fact that they are in His hand and that He is holding them. Because the leading ones are in the Lord&#8217;s hands, there is no need for them to shrink back. Christ truly takes the responsibility for His testimony.<p>Both the church and the leading ones in the churches must shine. All the leading ones should be stars shining in this dark and evil age. If we would be shining stars in the church, we need to realize that in ourselves we have no light. Christ is our light. We need to look unto Him with an unveiled face so that we may reflect His glory (2 Cor. 3:18). This causes us to become the stars, the messengers, held by the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>11. The Holder of the Keys of Death and Hades</h2><p>In Revelation 1:18 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I have the keys of death and of Hades.&#8221; Due to the fall and sin of man, death has come in and is now operating on earth to collect all sinful people and to bring them to Hades, the place where the dead are kept. In the church life, however, we are no longer subject to death and Hades. Christ abolished death on the cross, and He overcame Hades in His resurrection. Although death tried its best to hold Him, it was powerless to do so (Acts 2:24). Christ is both God and resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Because He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to hold Him. He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; instead, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it. With Christ, therefore, death has no sting and Hades has no power.<p>Because Christ is the One in the church who is the Holder of the keys of death and Hades, death and Hades should not have any power over us. In the church life the keys of death and Hades are in the Lord&#8217;s hand. It is impossible for us to deal with death; we simply do not have the ability to handle it. Whenever death enters, many will be overcome by it. But if we give the Lord Jesus the ground, the opportunity, and the free way to move and act among us, both death and Hades will be under His control. However, whenever the Lord Jesus does not have the ground in the church, death immediately becomes prevailing and Hades becomes powerful to hold the dead ones. It is crucial for us to see that Christ has the keys, the authority, of death and Hades. Death is subject to Him, and Hades is under His control.<h2 class=head2>12. The Living One</h2><p>In the church Christ is also the living One. In Revelation 1:18 the Lord says that He is the living One, that He became dead, and that He is now living forever and ever. The Christ who walks in the midst of the churches, who is the Head of the churches and to whom the churches belong, is the living One full of life. In the church we have a living Christ who has overcome death. Our Christ, who is the resurrected Christ, is living in us and among us. Therefore, all the churches should be as living as Christ, full of life and overcoming death.<h2 class=head2>13. The Holy One and the True One</h2><p>In Revelation 3:7 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as &#8220;the holy One, the true One.&#8221; He is the One by whom and with whom the church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God. Actually, Christ is the holiness and reality of the church. Without Him, we have worldliness, not holiness, and vanity, not reality. Therefore, we need to experience Christ as the holy One and as the true One. If we experience Him in this way, then the church will have genuine content.<h2 class=head2>14. The Amen</h2><p>In Revelation 3:14 the Lord says, &#8220;These things says the Amen.&#8221; This indicates that in the church Christ is the Amen. In Greek &#8220;amen&#8221; means firm, steadfast, trustworthy. In the church Christ is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Apart from Him, nothing is real or faithful. Apart from Him, nothing is &#8220;yes&#8221;; instead, everything and everyone is &#8220;no.&#8221; As the Amen, Christ is the real yes. Those who do not have Christ are a &#8220;no.&#8221; But if we have Christ, we are a &#8220;yes&#8221; in Him, for we have Him as the Amen.<h2 class=head1>V. IN GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>Let us now go on to consider what Christ is in His person in God&#8217;s building. To fulfill His eternal purpose God must accomplish two categories of work: the work of creation and the work of building. Scripture opens with God&#8217;s creation and finishes with His building. God&#8217;s creation is for His building, and God&#8217;s building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation. Today God is not doing the work of creation but the work of building. After He finished the work of creation, there was a garden in Eden. A garden indicates something created by God. At the end of the Bible we see a building, the New Jerusalem. Just as a garden signifies creation, so a city signifies building. Therefore, at the beginning of the Bible we have a garden indicating God&#8217;s creation and at the end of the Bible a city indicating God&#8217;s building. Although many neglect the matter of God&#8217;s building, it is strongly emphasized in the New Testament (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 3:9; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:16). In God&#8217;s building Christ is the rock, a living stone, the foundation, and the cornerstone.<h2 class=head2>1. The Rock</h2><p>In God&#8217;s building there is the need for a rock, and this rock is Christ (Matt. 16:18). According to the New Testament, God&#8217;s building is built absolutely on this rock, which is the Rock of Ages. This rock is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) and as the consummation of the Triune God after the steps of His process. Therefore, the rock for the building of God&#8217;s house is the consummated Triune God.<h2 class=head2>2. A Living Stone</h2><p>Christ is also the stone, the living stone, for God&#8217;s building. First Peter 2:4 speaks of Christ as a living stone: &#8220;To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.&#8221; A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life. This is Christ for God&#8217;s building. As life to us, Christ is the seed. For God&#8217;s building, He is the stone. After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us. In this way He makes us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature so that we may be built together with others a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone (Isa. 28:16).<p>In Christ and through Christ we also become living stones to be built up a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ, through regeneration and transformation. We were created of clay (Rom. 9:21). But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones. At Peter&#8217;s conversion the Lord gave him a new name-Peter, a stone (John 1:42). When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was also the rock (Matt. 16:16-18). Peter realized by these two incidents that both Christ and His believers are stones for God&#8217;s building. In actuality we become stones through the process of transformation. In this process our natural life is replaced by Christ, and Christ becomes us, thereby making us the precious materials for God&#8217;s building. Today we are undergoing the process of transformation so that Christ, the living stone, may be constituted into us to make us living stones for God&#8217;s building.<p>The spiritual house into which we are being built is God&#8217;s building. Eventually this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones. We are becoming the precious stones that will be built up into the New Jerusalem. This process takes place as we daily contact Christ, the living stone for God&#8217;s building, and are transformed.<h2 class=head2>3. The Foundation</h2><p>In God&#8217;s building Christ is the unique foundation. &#8220;Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:11). As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for His building. No one can lay any other foundation. Christ is the all-inclusive One. Nothing and no one can compare with Him. Nothing and no one, other than He, are qualified to be the foundation of the divine building in the universe according to God&#8217;s eternal economy. He is the unique One to be the unique foundation of this divine building.<h2 class=head2>4. The Cornerstone</h2><p>Ephesians 2:20 says that in God&#8217;s building Christ is the cornerstone. In this verse Christ is referred to as the cornerstone, not as the foundation, because the main concern here is the cornerstone that joins the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers. When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone (Acts 4:11; 1 Pet. 2:7), which joins the Gentiles to them for the building of God&#8217;s house.<p>God&#8217;s intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building. Many unbelieving Jews reject the Lord Jesus because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles. As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles. But as soon as a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined in Christ for God&#8217;s building.<p>It is crucial for us to see that God&#8217;s building in the New Testament age is altogether with Christ. In this building Christ is everything. This is why we should learn to minister nothing other than Christ to the believers. For God&#8217;s building we need Christ as everything to us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(40)</h1><p>In this message we come to the last aspect of what Christ is in His person-Christ in the divine administration.<h2 class=head1>W. IN THE DIVINE ADMINISTRATION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). The Christ who is God eternal, who became a man, who lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who died an all-inclusive death on the cross, who resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, and who ascended to the heavens to be the Lord, the Christ, and the Executor of God&#8217;s New Testament economy is now the Ruler of the kings of the earth. As the Ruler of the kings, He is far above all earthly rulers. Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities. Even all the kings and presidents are under His rule. He is the Ruler of all the ones who are in power. He is the chief Ruler in the divine government for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal plan. He is the King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). As such a Ruler, He rules the entire earth. Today the entire world is under the Lord&#8217;s ruling. He is sovereign over everyone and everything.<h2 class=head2>2. The Judge of the Churches</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is also the Judge of the churches (Rev. 1:13-16). As the One who walks in the midst of the churches, He has eyes that are as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14), for Him to observe and search in His judging by enlightening. The book of Revelation is a book with a judging nature, and fire is for divine judgment (1 Cor. 3:13; Heb. 6:8; 10:27). &#8220;Our God is also a consuming fire&#8221; (Heb. 12:29). His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels as burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him (Dan. 7:9-10). All this is for judgment. The main significance of the Lord&#8217;s eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment (Rev. 2:18-23; 19:11-12).<p>Revelation 1:15 says that, as the Judge of the churches, Christ has feet that are &#8220;like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace.&#8221; Feet signify one&#8217;s walk, and in typology brass signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). When Christ was on earth, His earthly walk and daily walk were tried and tested. Because His walk was tested, it came out shining. To be fired in the furnace is to be tried by being burned. Christ&#8217;s walk was tried by His sufferings, even by His death on the cross. Now the feet of Christ are as shining brass, signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise the divine judgment.<p>The sharp two-edged sword that proceeds out of Christ&#8217;s mouth (Rev. 1:16) is also related to judgment. This sword signifies Christ&#8217;s discerning, judging, and slaying word (Heb. 4:12: Eph. 6:17), which is for His dealing with negative persons and things. The words that proceed out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth are sharp, piercing into our being, dividing our soul from our spirit, and discerning the intents of our heart. Because of the church&#8217;s degradation, we all need a certain amount of judgment by the Lord&#8217;s word.<p>In Revelation 2:12 and 18 we again see Christ as the Judge of the churches. Speaking to the church in Pergamos, the Lord says in verse 12: &#8220;These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword.&#8221; Speaking to the church in Thyatira, He says in verse 18: &#8220;These things says the Son of God, who has eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like shining brass.&#8221; The church in Pergamos, a worldly church, needed to receive the Lord&#8217;s judgment in His sharp word. The church in Thyatira, an apostate church, needed the judging of His searching eyes and treading feet. The Lord&#8217;s eyes search the inward parts and the heart, and His feet judge and give to everyone according to his works (2:23). As the Administrator of God&#8217;s New Testament economy He judges, and His judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). Christ judges the churches by dressing, snuffing, trimming, the lampstands.<h2 class=head2>3. The Opener of the New Covenant</h2><p>In Revelation 5 we see that, in the divine administration, Christ is the Opener of the new covenant. The scroll in this chapter must be the new covenant enacted with the blood of the Lamb. The new covenant is a scroll covering the redemption of the church, Israel, the earth, and the universe. In the sealed scroll is the secrecy of God&#8217;s administration in the universe. Although the new covenant was enacted by the death of Christ, it has been a mystery to mankind. Now, after His resurrection and ascension, Christ is the Opener of the scroll of the new covenant.<p>Apart from Christ, no one is worthy to open the scroll of the new covenant (Rev. 5:2-4). John &#8220;wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it&#8221; (v. 4). Then John heard these words: &#8220;Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals&#8221; (v. 5). Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion. As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, He has overcome Satan, the enemy of God. He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. His overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals. Hence, He is worthy to open the scrolls concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Although John was told to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, verse 6 says that, &#8220;I saw in the midst of the throne... a Lamb standing as having been slain.&#8221; The angel recommended Christ as the Lion, but John saw Him as the Lamb. As the Lion, Christ is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. God&#8217;s purpose needs someone to carry it out who can solve all the problems of God. The problems that God had were the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. As the Lion, Christ has defeated the rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away the sin of fallen man. Because Christ has solved these two problems for God, He is worthy to open the scroll of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head2>4. The Shepherd of God&#8217;s Redeemed</h2><p>Revelation 7:9-17 is a record of Christ with God&#8217;s redeemed in eternity. Verse 9 speaks of &#8220;a great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches in their hands.&#8221; These are the redeemed ones, throughout all generations from the nations, who constitute the church (Rev. 5:9; Rom. 11:25; Acts 15:14, 19). They have been purchased with the blood of the Lamb, and their white robes indicate that their conduct is pure and approved by God through the washing of the blood of the Lamb (v. 14). In the divine administration Christ is the Shepherd of the redeemed. In eternity we shall not have problems, but we shall still need Christ&#8217;s shepherding, especially His feeding. Under the shepherding of Christ, we shall not want (Psa. 23:1).<p>Revelation 7:16 and 17 say, &#8220;They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, neither shall the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and shall guide them to springs of waters of life; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.&#8221; Here we see that the Lamb will shepherd God&#8217;s redeemed and guide them to springs of waters of life. As our Shepherd Christ will lead us into Himself as the spring of water of life so that we may enjoy the eternal dispensing of the Triune God. In eternity we shall drink of many springs and enjoy many different waters.<p>Furthermore, under Christ&#8217;s shepherding our tears will be wiped away. Tears are a sign of dissatisfaction. Waters of life are for satisfaction. Because the Lamb will supply God&#8217;s redeemed with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction. The waters of life will be supplied, and the water of tears will be wiped away. Under Christ&#8217;s shepherding in eternity there will be no tears, hunger, or thirst-just enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>5. The Executor of God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><p>The book of Revelation is a book of judgment, and Revelation 8:3-5 unveils Christ as the Executor of God&#8217;s judgment. Verse 3 says, &#8220;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.&#8221; This another Angel is Christ, not as a common angel but as a special Angel. In the administration of God&#8217;s judgment on earth, Christ is the Angel standing in the position of One who has been sent by God. Here Christ appears as another Angel to execute God&#8217;s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints. As Christ offers the prayers of His saints to God, He adds His incense to them. Hence, verse 4 says that &#8220;the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God.&#8221; The smoke of the incense indicates that the incense is burned to God with the prayers of the saints. This implies that by the incense which is added to them the prayers of the saints become effective and acceptable to God.<p>Verse 5 continues, &#8220;The Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.&#8221; This implies the answer to the prayers of the saints, especially the prayers in Revelation 6:9-11 and Luke 18:7-8. These prayers must be for the judgment of the earth which opposes God&#8217;s economy. The answer to the saints&#8217; prayers is the execution of God&#8217;s judgment upon the earth. To cast fire to the earth is to execute God&#8217;s judgment upon the earth. Therefore, the thunders, voices, lightnings, and the earthquake come as signs of God&#8217;s judgment executed by Christ.<h2 class=head2>6. The Possessor of the Sea and the Land</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is also the Possessor of the sea and the land. Revelation 10:1-7 is a vision of Christ coming to possess the earth. Verse 2 says, &#8220;He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.&#8221; For Christ to place His feet on the sea and on the land is to tread on them, and this means that He takes possession of them (Psa. 8:6; cf. Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3). Christ is coming to take possession of the earth. Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth.<h2 class=head2>7. The One Declaring the Judgment over Babylon the Great</h2><p>According to Revelation 18:1 and 2, Christ is the One declaring the judgment over Babylon the great. Verse 1 says, &#8220;I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.&#8221; This another Angel is Christ, coming down out of heaven, with whose glory the earth is illumined. In His appearing for the judgment of Babylon the great, Christ will come as the Angel sent by God. In Revelation 10:1 Christ is clothed with a cloud, and in 14:14 He is sitting on a cloud, but His glory in 18:1 shines over the earth, indicating that His coming back to earth is closer than the coming mentioned in 10:1 and 14:14. Christ will come down out of heaven on the cloud secretly, then He will come on the cloud openly, and eventually He will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the great, the city of Rome, with great authority. At this time He will take full possession of the earth, and earth will become His kingdom (Rev. 11:15). Therefore, the judgment of Babylon the great will take place at the appearing of Christ.<p>As the One declaring the judgment over Babylon the great, Christ says, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! And she has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird&#8221; (v. 2). In Revelation 14:8 an angel said, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,&#8221; and in 18:2 Christ cries out with the same words. This indicates that Babylon will have two falls, the fall of religious Babylon and the fall of material Babylon. The fall of religious Babylon will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation, and the fall of material Babylon will occur at the end of the great tribulation. In 18:2 Christ declares judgment over material Babylon, not religious Babylon, for this city is ugly and abominable in the sight of God.<h2 class=head2>8. The Judge of the Believers at the Judgment Seat</h2><p>Certain verses in the New Testament reveal that Christ is the Judge of the believers at the judgment seat. &#8220;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for the things done through the body, according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:10). At the judgment seat Christ will judge His believers not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward. Therefore, while we are still in the body we should do things through it to please the Lord so that we may be rewarded by the Lord at His coming.<p>The judgment in 2 Corinthians 5:10 is not the eternal judgment of God mentioned in Romans 2:2, 3, 5, 16, and 3:8, which will be mainly carried out at the white throne described in Revelation 20:11-15. The eternal judgment at the white throne will be after the millennium, will judge all the dead unbelievers, and will concern eternal punishment in the lake of fire. The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will judge the life and work of the believers, and it will determine whether the believers will receive a reward for the good or suffer a loss for the bad.<p>In Romans 14:10 Paul says, &#8220;We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.&#8221; The eternal judgment at the white throne will be after the millennium, it will be for the dead unbelievers, and it will be for eternal punishment in the lake of fire. However, the judgment at the judgment seat of God, which is the judgment seat of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:10, will be held before the millennium, immediately after Christ&#8217;s return (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; 25:19; Luke 19:15), and the life and work of the believers will be judged at that time (Rev. 22:12; Matt. 16:27; 1 Cor. 4:5; 3:13-15; Matt. 25:19; Luke 19:15). This judgment has nothing to do with a believer&#8217;s salvation, for everyone who appears at the judgment seat of God will have already been saved. This judgment will judge the believers&#8217; life and work after they have been saved, and it will determine a believer&#8217;s reward in the millennial kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23; Luke 19:17, 19; Rev. 22:12; Luke 14:14; 2 Tim. 4:8). The believers will stand before the Lord Jesus at His judgment seat to give an account of their life and work.<p>First Corinthians 4:5 says, &#8220;Do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who shall both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each one from God.&#8221; This verse also indicates that Christ will be the Judge of the believers. If we consider this verse in context, we shall realize that here Paul is saying that the One who examines us is the Lord and that we should leave the matter of judgment with Him. Christ will judge us in the day of His appearing. If we have done rightly, we shall receive praise from God.<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:13 Paul says, &#8220;The work of each shall become manifest; for the day shall make it known, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will test each one&#8217;s work, of what sort it is.&#8221; The day here is the day of Christ&#8217;s second coming, when He will judge His believers. The fire is the fire of the Lord&#8217;s judgment (Mal. 3:2; 4:1; 2 Thes. 1:8; Heb. 6:8), which will cause each believer&#8217;s work to be manifest and will try and test his work. All the work of wood, grass, and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12) will not be able to stand that test and will be burned. The work that remains (v. 14) must be that of gold, silver, and precious stones. Such a work will be rewarded by the coming and judging Lord. Christ&#8217;s reward is based upon the believer&#8217;s work after being saved. It differs from salvation, which is based upon faith in the Lord and His redemptive work.<h2 class=head2>9. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords Defeating Antichrist</h2><p>In Revelation 19:11-21 we see Christ as the King of kings and Lord of lords defeating Antichrist. Verse 11 says, &#8220;I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.&#8221; Christ will be faithful in destroying Antichrist and true in carrying out God&#8217;s economy. He will judge and fight in righteousness, even judging by fighting. When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious. Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and judge it in righteousness. His judging by fighting will not only be according to righteousness but will also maintain righteousness.<p>As the One who defeats Antichrist, Christ is called The Word of God (v. 13). The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace to God&#8217;s chosen people but also by executing God&#8217;s judgment upon Antichrist and his followers. Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God. God is righteous and sovereign. He is also a God of order and cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion. As Christ fights against Antichrist, He will declare that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly, that God is over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority. Christ&#8217;s fighting against Antichrist, therefore, will be a powerful speaking. It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him.<p>Revelation 19:15 says, &#8220;Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus comes to fight against Antichrist, He will simply need to speak a word. This is the Lord&#8217;s way of fighting. Undoubtedly, Antichrist will use the most modern weapons, but Christ will defeat him with the sharp sword, the almighty word that proceeds out of His mouth.<p>Revelation 19:16 tells us, &#8220;He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.&#8221; The fact that this name will be written upon Christ&#8217;s garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all. The garment signifies Christ&#8217;s attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.<p>Revelation 19:19 speaks of Christ&#8217;s enemies: &#8220;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (Rev. 17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun (Rev. 19:16; 16:12).<p>In Revelation 19:20 and 21 we see Christ&#8217;s defeat of Antichrist and his armies. &#8220;The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet....These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone&#8221; (v. 20). Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to perish in the lake of fire. All the rest will be killed &#8220;with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse&#8221; (v. 21). This is Christ in the divine administration as the King of kings and the Lord of lords defeating Antichrist.<h2 class=head2>10. The Judge of the Living</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is the Judge of the living. &#8220;The Father does not judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son&#8221; (John 5:22). As the Son of God (John 5:25) Christ can give life (John 5:21), and as the Son of Man He can execute judgment. Because Christ is a man, He is fully qualified to judge man. Romans 2:16 says, &#8220;God shall judge the secrets of men...by Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Father &#8220;gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man&#8221; (John 5:27). Furthermore, the Father gave all judgment to the Son &#8220;that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father&#8221; (John 5:23). The Son will judge justly according to the Father&#8217;s will (John 5:30). He is one with the Father in the matter of judgment.<p>Acts 17:31 says that God &#8220;has set a day in which He is about to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a Man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from among the dead.&#8221; The day set by God for the judgment of the inhabited earth will be the day when Christ will judge the living from the throne of His glory before the millennium (Matt. 25:31-36), probably not including the day when He will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). According to Acts 10:42, Christ has been designated by God &#8220;to be the Judge of the living and the dead.&#8221; He will be the Judge of the dead after the millennium at the great white throne. Second Timothy 4:1 and 1 Peter 4:5 also say that Christ will judge both the living and the dead. The day in Acts 17:31 refers particularly to the day when Christ will judge the living, because on this day He will judge &#8220;the inhabited earth,&#8221; which should refer only to living men. This day of Christ&#8217;s judgment on earth will be brought in by His coming back. He has been designated by God to execute this judgment, and God&#8217;s raising Him from among the dead is strong proof of this.<h2 class=head2>11. The King Reigning over the Earth in the Millennium and for Eternity</h2><p>Revelation 20:4 and 6 reveal that Christ with the overcomers will reign over the nations for a thousand years in the coming age, and Revelation 11:15 unveils that at Christ&#8217;s coming back the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever. By all these verses we can see that Christ as the Administrator of God will be the King reigning over the earth in the millennium and for eternity. In the coming age and eternity Christ will be the Ruler over all the peoples on the earth in the divine administration.<h2 class=head2>12. The Judge of All the Dead</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ will be the Judge not only of the living but also of all the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). As described in Revelation 20:11-15, Christ will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium. Revelation 20:11 says, &#8220;I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.&#8221; &#8220;White&#8221; here signifies righteous, indicating that the Lord&#8217;s great throne for His judgment is righteous. &#8220;Him&#8221; is the Lord Jesus, for God the Father has given all judgment to the Son and has ordained Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead.<p>Revelation 20:12 goes on to say, &#8220;I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the books, according to their works.&#8221; The word &#8220;standing&#8221; indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment, after the millennium (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24). The unbelieving dead will be judged by the things written in the books. These books are the records of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers, according to which they will be judged. The other book that is opened, the book of life, is the record of the names of the believers (Rev. 13:8; 17:8; Luke 10:20). The unbelievers will be judged by the things written in the books, according to their works. All that they have said and done will be written in these books.<p>Revelation 20:15 says, &#8220;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.&#8221; The perishing unbelievers will be judged according to the books, which are a record of their works (vv. 12-13), but they will be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life. This indicates that they are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they will perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life. Not believing in the Lord Jesus is the unique sin that causes people to perish (John 16:9).<p>In this message we have seen all that Christ is in God&#8217;s economical administration. These aspects of Christ are marvelous, beyond our ability to enjoy or comprehend fully. Some of these aspects of Christ are also included in the divine dispensing. If we allow Christ to dispense Himself with all His unsearchable riches into us, this dispensing will include what He is in the divine administration.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS ATTRIBUTES AND VIRTUES</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider Christ&#8217;s attributes and virtues. We use &#8220;attributes&#8221; in relation to God and &#8220;virtues&#8221; in relation to man. The Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. The divine attributes are related to what God is and has. Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence, He possesses the divine nature with the divine attributes. Because He was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He possesses the human virtues. Therefore, while He was on earth, He lived a life that was both human and divine. He lived a human life, but in that life the divine attributes were expressed.<p>Christ is the God-man, a person who is the mingling of divinity with humanity. In Him we see all the attributes of God and all the human virtues. The makeup of Christ&#8217;s being, His constitution, is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. In the Lord Jesus man and God, God and man, are mingled to form a composition full of the divine attributes and the human virtues. Furthermore, in Christ the divine attributes strengthen and enrich the human virtues.<p>In His incarnation Christ, the very God, was born in such a way as to have the human virtues. He was conceived of God to have the divine attributes, and He was born of mankind to have the human virtues. With Him the divine attributes filled the human virtues, and the human virtues contained the divine attributes. In Christ the divine attributes and the human virtues are one; that is, the divine attributes and the human virtues are mingled together as one. With Christ the divine attributes are in the human virtues, and the human virtues contain the divine attributes. Therefore, possessing the divine nature and the human nature, He lived a life on earth with the attributes of God expressed in the virtues of man.<p>Today the Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes. The Christ who is being dispensed into us is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. While He was on earth, He lived a life that was a composition of these two. From the time of His resurrection He has been seeking to live in the believers the kind of life He lived on earth. This means that within us today Christ is still living a life that is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. If we see this, we shall say with Paul, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20).<h2 class=head1>A. GLORY</h2><p>One of Christ&#8217;s attributes is glory (Heb. 2:9; Rev. 5:12). According to the Bible, glory is God expressed. Whenever God is expressed, that is glory. Hebrews 2:9 says that Christ has been crowned with glory. This glory is the splendor, in the expression of God, related to His person. After He accomplished redemption by suffering death, the Lord Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26), and in His ascension to the heavens He was crowned with glory. Man crowned Him with thorns to shame Him (John 19:2), but God crowned Him with glory to show forth the splendor of His person in God&#8217;s glory.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in John 17:5 indicates that He and the Father are the same in glory: &#8220;Glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&#8221; This reveals that the Son is exactly the same as the Father in glorification. The Son is glorified along with the Father and with the same glory that the Father has. This word shows that Christ had the divine glory along with the Father before the world was, that is, in eternity past, and that He should be glorified with the Father with that glory now. The Lord Jesus participates in the divine glory, not separately by Himself, but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one (John 10:30). Therefore, Christ and the Father are the same in the divine glory.<p>Before His incarnation, Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father. But when He put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh. His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him. The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord&#8217;s humanity. Christ&#8217;s divine element was confined in His humanity much as God&#8217;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Outwardly, the Lord Jesus appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Galilean and a Nazarene. This was the appearance of the shell of His humanity. But within this shell the divine glory was confined and concealed. As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before. Although the Lord lived among them as a man, He lived in such a way that He expressed God. What the disciples saw in the Lord Jesus was the expression of the divine glory that was within Him. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, Christ&#8217;s divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by three of the disciples (Matt. 17:1-4; John 1:14). But it was concealed again in His flesh. Therefore, it was necessary for Him to pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken for His divine element to be released. He also had to be resurrected so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed so that His entire being, both His divinity and His humanity, might be glorified.<h2 class=head1>B. HONOR</h2><p>Another of Christ&#8217;s attributes is honor (Heb. 2:9; Rev. 5:12). Honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&#8217; worth, value (&#8220;precious&#8221; in 1 Peter 2:7 is the same word in Greek as &#8220;honor&#8221; in Hebrews 2:9), and the dignity which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; Rom. 13:7). Whereas glory, the expression of God, refers to a condition, honor refers to a high position, in particular to the dignity that is related to such a position. As the ascended One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is in a state of glory and has a rank of honor.<p>Although Christ is both the Son of God and the Son of Man, when we come to His being crowned with glory and honor, we must pay special attention to His humanity, to His being the Son of Man. It is in His humanity that He is crowned with glory and honor. As a man in His ascension to the heavens, He has been crowned in this way. The very Jesus who was born in a manger, who was raised in a poor home in Nazareth, and who had no beauty or comeliness, in His ascension has been crowned with glory and honor.<h2 class=head1>C. AUTHORITY</h2><p>Christ also has the attribute of authority. &#8220;The crowds were astounded at His teaching, for He was teaching them as One having authority, and not as their scribes&#8221; (Matt. 7:28-29). In decreeing the new law of the kingdom of the heavens, Christ spoke with authority. The Lord&#8217;s authority is also indicated in His giving the twelve disciples authority over unclean spirits (Matt. 10:1).<p>John 17:2 says, &#8220;You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&#8221; This verse indicates that Christ the Son has the Father&#8217;s authority over all mankind so that He may give eternal life not to all mankind, but to those whom the Father has given Him. All mankind is under the authority of the Son because the Father has entrusted Him with this authority for the purpose of giving eternal life to the Father&#8217;s chosen ones.<p>In Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&#8221; In His divinity as the only begotten Son of God, Christ had authority over all. However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection. As God, Christ had all authority over all before His incarnation. After He went through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, as the processed and consummated God-man to be the Lord of all and the Christ of God, He was given all authority both in heaven and on earth. He is unique in authority.<h2 class=head1>D. POWER</h2><p>Revelation 5:12 indicates that Christ has the attribute of power. Second Corinthians 12:9 says, &#8220;He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.&#8221; Sufferings and trials are often the Lord&#8217;s ordination for us that we may experience Christ as grace and power. In his experience Paul realized that the Lord&#8217;s grace became power spread over him like a tent. Hence, this grace-power became a dwelling place for Paul in his sufferings. As he was suffering, Paul could dwell in the tabernacle spread over him. This tabernacle, this tent, sustained him, supported him, maintained him, and kept him.<p>To show forth the perfectness of Christ&#8217;s power, our weakness is needed. For this reason, Paul would most gladly boast in his weakness, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace. Both are the resurrected Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us for our enjoyment.<p>The Greek word translated &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo. Skenoo, meaning to dwell in a tent, is used in John 1:14 and Revelation 21:3. Episkenoo here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon. It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weakness.<p>In Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. The power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). The reality of the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ&#8217;s death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. To experience the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life as He did. Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up so that His divine life may be expressed in us.<h2 class=head1>E. MIGHT</h2><p>Revelation 5:13 says, &#8220;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.&#8221; This verse indicates that might is another of Christ&#8217;s attributes. The Greek word for &#8220;might&#8221; (kratos), denotes manifested power. God&#8217;s power toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength (Eph. 1:19). We are empowered in the might of His strength (Eph. 6:10), empowered with all power according to the might of His glory (Col. 1:11). The Lord&#8217;s might is of the Lord&#8217;s strength, and the Lord&#8217;s strength is for the Lord&#8217;s power. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s might is the substance of the Lord&#8217;s power, substantiating His power toward us.<h2 class=head1>F. RICHES</h2><p>Revelation 5:12 says that Christ the Lamb is worthy to receive riches, and Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ&#8217;s riches are vast and inexhaustible. In the Scriptures these riches are depicted in types, such as light, the sun, the star, the vine, the apple tree, the cedar, the cypress, the Passover, wheat, barley, the henna flower, Adam, Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Aaron, and Moses. Beneath the surface of the Bible are all the riches of Christ seen in the types. Because these riches are so vast, it is difficult for anyone to say how many types of Christ there are. Just this one matter of the types reveals many of the riches of Christ.<p>Christ&#8217;s riches are also portrayed in shadows, figures, prophecies, and in the fulfillment of prophecies. In the Bible the first prophecy concerning Christ is Genesis 3:15, a verse which predicts that Christ as the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, Satan. This implies that Christ had to become a man born of a virgin, for He was to be the seed of woman. This one verse reveals much of the riches of Christ.<p>Sometimes in the fulfillment of a prophecy concerning Christ in the New Testament something further is added. For example, the Old Testament reveals that Christ will be the Lamb, but in the Old Testament He is not called the Lamb of God. Nevertheless, in the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Christ as the Lamb, He is called the Lamb of God (John 1:29). The reason for this is that Christ cannot be limited by the prophecies concerning Him. When He came, He fulfilled more than what had been prophesied. Furthermore, our experience of Christ surpasses the fulfillment of the prophecies. In our experience Christ is not only the Lamb of God but the Lamb of eternity (Rev. 21:22-23; 22:1). Thus, the prophecy is short, the fulfillment is longer, and the experience is eternal. When we experience Christ in the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Him, we enter into the eternal experience of the inexhaustible riches of Christ.<p>Because Christ&#8217;s riches are unsearchable, untraceable, all the positive things in the universe point to Christ. For this reason, when He was on earth, He could use many things as illustrations of Himself. Christ with His unsearchable riches is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.<p>All the riches of Christ are for the producing of the church. The church is produced not by teaching nor by organizing but by the dispensing of the riches of Christ into us. As these riches are dispensed into us, we need to digest and assimilate them. By absorbing Christ&#8217;s riches in this way, we become His Body as His fullness (Eph. 1:22-23) to express Him. Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ enjoyed and assimilated by us.<h2 class=head1>G. PEACE</h2><p>John 14:27 says, &#8220;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.&#8221; Here we see that Christ has the attribute of peace. Christ&#8217;s peace is not only an attribute of Christ; it is also Christ Himself. Ephesians 2:14 says, &#8220;He Himself is our peace.&#8221; This peace is for our relationship with God and with men. This peace is also concerning our condition and situation. Christ has given us this peace that we may enjoy tranquillity in our relationship with God and with men and in our daily life, regardless of what our condition and situation may be.<h2 class=head1>H. JOY</h2><p>In John 15:11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.&#8221; This verse indicates that another of Christ&#8217;s attributes is joy. Joy comes out of peace and goes along with peace. Since Christ has the attribute of peace, He simultaneously also has the attribute of joy. It is in His joy that we can rejoice. We should rejoice in Him always (Phil. 3:1; 4:4). This is to enjoy Him as our joy.<h2 class=head1>I. KNOWLEDGE-SURPASSING LOVE</h2><p>In Ephesians 3:19 Paul speaks of the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. The love of Christ surpasses knowledge; yet we can know it by experiencing it. According to our mentality, the love of Christ is knowledge-surpassing. Our mind is not able to know it. But in our spirit we can know the love of Christ through our experience.<p>Just as Christ is immeasurable (Eph. 3:18), so His love is also immeasurable. Actually, the love of Christ is not merely something belonging to Christ; this love is Christ Himself. Because Christ is immeasurable, His love is knowledge-surpassing. If we compare what we have so far experienced of the immeasurable love of Christ to all there is to experience, it is like comparing a raindrop to the ocean. Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable, knowledge-surpassing love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience and know in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>J. SUFFICIENT GRACE</h2><p>Regarding the thorn in the flesh, Paul entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him (2 Cor. 12:7-8). But the Lord Jesus said to him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you&#8221; (v. 9). Instead of removing the thorn, the Lord supplied Paul with the sufficient grace to enable him to bear the suffering. Then in Paul&#8217;s experience this grace became the power that is made perfect in weakness.<p>According to the New Testament, grace is what Christ is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17). Grace is actually Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Thus, grace is mainly not the work the Lord Jesus does for us; grace is the Triune God in Christ dispensed into us and experienced as our enjoyment. In brief, grace is Christ as the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing.<p>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ. In his experience Paul realized that this grace is Christ Himself. When Christ is enjoyed by us as our portion, that is grace. Grace is Christ not in doctrine but in experience, for grace is Christ with all He is for our enjoyment. This includes life, power, and His other divine attributes.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 also speaks of the grace of Christ: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; This blessing is composed of grace, love, and fellowship. The love of God the Father is the source, the fount; and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of love. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a matter of communication, transportation, transmission. Therefore, love is the source, grace is the flow, and fellowship is the transmission of the flow with the source. Second Corinthians 13:14 clearly says that grace is of Christ, love is of God, and fellowship is of the Holy Spirit. Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, the grace of Christ is the Triune God as our life, life supply, and enjoyment. This grace issues out from the Father&#8217;s love and is transmitted into us by the Spirit. Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the full enjoyment of the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>K. SYMPATHY</h2><p>Hebrews 4:15 indicates that Christ, our High Priest, has the virtue of sympathy: &#8220;We do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin.&#8221; Christ has been tried in all respects like us. Because He has been tried, He is qualified and able to help us who are being tried. He is equipped to help us pass through trials and to keep us from any entanglement of sin. As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, Christ is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow suffering with us in our weaknesses. Whatever happens to us and whatever suffering we may have, He feels it with us and sympathizes with us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS ATTRIBUTES AND VIRTUES</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further Christ&#8217;s divine attributes and human virtues.<h2 class=head1>L. MERCY</h2><p>Hebrews 2:17 says, &#8220;He ought to be made like His brothers in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God.&#8221; Christ became a man and lived on earth as a man, passing through all the human sufferings. As a result, He is fully qualified to be merciful to us. He knows how to be merciful to man, for He is a man with the experience of human life, the experience of human suffering.<p>In order to be qualified to be the High Priest, Christ was incarnated to be like us. We may even say that He is more than like us because He suffered in His human life certain things that we have not suffered. He became like us, sympathizing with all our weaknesses. Therefore, as the High Priest He is merciful to us.<p>Christ&#8217;s mercy is far-reaching. His mercy goes farther than His grace. Christ&#8217;s love does not reach as far as His grace, and His grace does not reach as far as His mercy. Grace extends only to a situation that corresponds to it. But mercy goes much farther, reaching into a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace. According to our natural condition, we are eligible only to receive the Lord&#8217;s mercy, a mercy that reaches down to our pitiful condition.<p>Even now, although we are saved, we are still, in some ways, in a condition that needs the Lord&#8217;s mercy to reach us. This is the reason Hebrews 4:16 says that first we need to obtain mercy, and then we can find grace for timely help. Christ&#8217;s mercy is always available to us. However, we need to receive it by exercising our spirit to contact our High Priest who sympathizes with us in all our weaknesses.<h2 class=head1>M. COMPASSION</h2><p>The Gospel of Matthew portrays Christ&#8217;s compassion. Matthew 9:36 says, &#8220;Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion concerning them, because they were harrassed and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd.&#8221; This verse indicates that Christ regarded the people as sheep and Himself as the Shepherd. When He came to the people, they were like lepers, paralytics, demon-possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons, because they had no shepherd to care for them. He was moved with compassion, therefore, when He saw the people in their desperate situation. On another occasion, &#8220;He saw a great crowd, and He had compassion on them and healed their sick&#8221; (Matt. 14:14).<p>Christ&#8217;s compassion is also displayed in the miracle of the feeding of the four thousand (Matt. 15:32-39). Verse 32 says, &#8220;Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with Me now three days and do not have anything they can eat; and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.&#8221; Because the Lord Jesus had compassion on the multitude in the wilderness, He would not send them away fasting. Christ will not allow His followers to hunger and faint in the way while following Him.<p>Compassion is somewhat different from mercy. Although compassion is close to mercy, compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy. Mercy is somewhat outward, but compassion is inward. Compassion involves a deeply affectionate feeling. Compassion, therefore, refers to the inward feeling that resides in the one who looks upon wretchedness. It is the deepest of words showing Christ&#8217;s inward affection for man in his pitiful condition. This affection originates in Christ&#8217;s loving essence. Furthermore, compassion is longer lasting than mercy. Hence, compassion is both deeper and longer lasting than mercy.<h2 class=head1>N. MEEKNESS</h2><p>In His humanity Christ has the virtue of meekness. To be meek means not to resist the world&#8217;s opposition but to suffer it willingly. To have the virtue of meekness means that we do not invade others or fight with them. Instead, we are willing to give in. The meek give in to others, but those who are strong in a natural way fight and refuse to give in. At the least, they want to stand their ground. The meek, however, give in, do not fight, and do not invade others&#8217; territory. The Lord Jesus said of Himself, &#8220;I am meek...in heart&#8221; (Matt. 11:29). In facing opposition the Lord Jesus was always meek.<p>Paul in 2 Corinthians 10:1 speaks of the meekness of Christ. Meekness is a virtue of the humanity of Christ by the divine life. Christ&#8217;s meekness is not a simple matter, for it is in His humanity and by the divine life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a human life by the divine life. Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested.<p>Christ&#8217;s meekness is seen in the way He entered Jerusalem as described in Matthew 21:1-11. He was &#8220;meek and mounted on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden&#8221; (v. 5). This signifies the meek and lowly state in which the Lord was willing to present Himself. The donkey and the colt together give an impression of meekness. If the Lord had been mounted only on a donkey, the impression of meekness would not have been so striking. The significance of the Lord&#8217;s being mounted on a donkey and on a colt is not smallness but meekness. Christ, the heavenly King, did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness. He did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse; He came mounted on a little donkey, even a small colt. No earthly king would do such a thing. The Lord Jesus, however, came to be a meek King. Yes, He was the heavenly King, but He had no intention to come as a great king fighting or competing with others. Instead, He came as a meek King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone. This is the meekness of Christ.<h2 class=head1>O. FORBEARANCE</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul also speaks of the forbearance of Christ, a virtue, like meekness, that is produced by the mingling of divinity and humanity in the Lord Jesus. Hence, forbearance is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life. To have meekness is to not invade others but to give in to them; to have forbearance means that we are willing to be invaded by others and to suffer affliction and injury. Meekness and forbearance are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.<p>The Greek word rendered forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1 is composed of two words: epi, a preposition that means unto, and eikos, which means seemly, fitting, or suitable. When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive. The use of this preposition as a component of the Greek word for forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1 indicates that the meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest extent. Christ has a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness. Furthermore, He always acts in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest extent.<p>The Greek word for forbearance is rendered different ways by different translations. Some versions render the word as yieldingness. The word used in the Chinese version means to give in humbly. These understandings are correct, but they are rather shallow. Other translators point out that the Greek word means reasonable, considerate, suitable, and fitting. A forbearing person is one who always fits in, one whose behavior is always suitable.<p>The virtue of forbearance is all-inclusive. It includes love, kindness, mercy, peacefulness, mildness, gentleness, reasonableness, the ability to fit in, and many other virtues. If we are reasonable, considerate, and able to fit in, we shall also be gentle, kind, mild, and peaceful. Furthermore, we shall be meek and moderate, full of compassion for others. The opposite of forbearance is being just in an exacting way. A person who lacks forbearance will be exacting and demanding of others. But to be forbearing means that we are easily satisfied, even with less than our due. Alford says that the Greek word for forbearance means not to be strict with respect to legal rights.<p>The best word to sum up the totality of Christ&#8217;s human virtues is forbearance. Besides the Lord Jesus, no human being has ever practiced a life of forbearance. If you study the biographies of famous people, you will see that not one was truly a person of forbearance. However, if you read the four Gospels, you will see that the human living of the Lord Jesus was full of forbearance. In particular, the Lord exercised forbearance with His disciples. Consider, for example, how He spoke to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus as recorded in Luke 24. He drew near, went with them, and said to them, &#8220;What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking?&#8221; (v. 17). With a rebuking tone, one of the disciples replied, &#8220;Are you a stranger dwelling alone in Jerusalem and do not know the things which took place in it in these days?&#8221; (v. 18). Appearing not to know anything, the Lord asked, &#8220;What things?&#8221; (v. 19). Then they proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth, &#8220;a Prophet, powerful in work and word before God and all the people&#8221; (v. 19) and who was crucified. How forbearing the Lord Jesus was to listen to the disciples speak things that He knew much better than they did! After walking quite a distance, &#8220;they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther. And they urged Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is toward evening and the day is already nearly over. And He went in to stay with them&#8221; (vv. 28-29), even sitting down to dine with them. When He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, &#8220;their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him&#8221; (vv. 30-31). In this we surely see Christ&#8217;s forbearance. He has the growth in life, the satisfaction in life, and the contentment of life required to have the virtue of forbearance. Therefore, wherever He was He was full of forbearance and He could exercise His forbearance toward all.<h2 class=head1>P. LOWLINESS</h2><p>Lowliness is somewhat different from humility. A person may be humble without being willing to be lowly, for he may desire to be uplifted. A lowly person, on the contrary, is humble in his lowliness. In his lowliness his humility can be seen.<p>According to Matthew 11:29, Christ has the virtue of lowliness: &#8220;I am...lowly in heart.&#8221; To be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. In facing rejection the Lord Jesus was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, regardless of the situation, He had rest in His heart. He was fully satisfied with His Father&#8217;s will. We should enjoy Him as such a One in His lowliness.<h2 class=head1>Q. SELF-HUMBLING</h2><p>The first part of Philippians 2:8 says of Christ, &#8220;Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself.&#8221; Here we see Christ&#8217;s virtue of self-humbling. When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men. Then being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself. First He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men. Then He humbled Himself.<p>Christ was God with the expression of God. Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men. Then, being found in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself. This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything. Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross.<p>Christ&#8217;s humbling Himself was a further step in the emptying of Himself. Christ&#8217;s self-humbling manifested His self-emptying. The death of the cross was the climax of Christ&#8217;s humiliation. We should worship Him in the climax of His humiliation.<h2 class=head1>R. OBEDIENCE</h2><p>Philippians 2:8 also speaks of Christ&#8217;s obedience, saying that He became &#8220;obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&#8221; Romans 5:19 tells us that through this obedience of Christ shall the many be constituted righteous. This refers to the righteous act of Christ&#8217;s obedience on the cross. The result of this obedience is that the grace of God has abounded to many (Rom. 5:15), that the many will be constituted righteous (v. 19), that we have been justified unto life (v. 18), that grace will reign through righteousness unto eternal life (v. 21), and that in Christ all shall be made alive (1 Cor. 15:22). The result of Christ&#8217;s obedience is life unto all.<h2 class=head1>S. FAITHFULNESS</h2><p>Hebrews 2:17 tells us that Christ is a merciful and faithful High Priest. The word &#8220;merciful&#8221; corresponds to Christ&#8217;s being a man, and the word &#8220;faithful&#8221; corresponds to His being God. In order to be faithful we need not only virtue but also ability. We may have the desire to be faithful in keeping our word, but we may lack the ability, the means, to fulfill it. Eventually, due to our inability, we may be forced to be unfaithful. However, as our High Priest Christ is not merely an honest, virtuous man; He is the faithful God. God is faithful (Heb. 10:23). He is able to fulfill whatever He says. Furthermore, God never lies (Heb. 6:18). Whatever He speaks He is able to fulfill, for He has the means to fulfill His word. Therefore, Christ can be faithful because He is God.<p>Only God can be fully faithful. None of us can be altogether faithful. But nothing can keep God from fulfilling His word. Therefore, Christ can be a faithful High Priest because He is the almighty God. Since He, as the Son of God, is God Himself, He can be faithful to us as our High Priest.<h2 class=head1>T. TRUTHFULNESS</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, &#8220;The truth of Christ is in me.&#8221; Here &#8220;truth&#8221; refers to the virtue of truthfulness. Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior. Christ&#8217;s truthfulness is His genuineness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness as a divine attribute (Rom. 3:7; 15:8) and as a human virtue (Mark 12:14), an issue of the divine reality (John 4:23-24; 2 John 1; 3 John 1). Such a divine attribute and a human virtue should be our experience and enjoyment of Christ.<h2 class=head1>U. RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Second Peter 1:1 speaks of &#8220;the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&#8221; Jesus Christ is God to be our Savior. This verse speaks of the righteousness not only of our God but also of our Savior. From what Paul says in Romans we may think that the righteousness of God is one thing and that the righteousness of Christ is another. But here Peter combines these two kinds of righteousness when he speaks of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. This is an important matter that requires proper understanding.<p>The Greek word for righteousness in 2 Peter 1:1 may also be rendered justice. Our God is righteous, just. In His justice, He has allotted precious faith as a divine portion equally to all believers in Christ, both Jew and Gentile, without respect of persons. Now He is not only our God but also our Savior. Thus, His righteousness is not the righteousness merely of God nor merely of Christ but the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ. As our Savior, His righteousness is His righteous act, His death on the cross in absolute obedience (Phil. 2:8), accomplishing propitiation for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2), enabling us to be justified by God (Rom. 5:18). As our God, His righteousness is His justice in that, based upon the righteous act, the redemption of our Savior, Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:24-25) justifies all the believers in Christ (Rom. 3:26), both Jew and Gentile (Rom. 3:30). In and by means of such a twofold righteousness, the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, the precious faith has been allotted equally to all believers.<p>In 1 John 2:1 Jesus Christ is called &#8220;the Righteous.&#8221; Our Lord Jesus is the only righteous Man among all men. His righteous act (Rom. 5:18) on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners. Only He is qualified to be our Advocate to care for us in our sinning condition and restore us to a righteous condition so that our Father, who is righteous, may be appeased.<p>Instead of speaking of &#8220;Jesus Christ the Righteous,&#8221; we may say, &#8220;Jesus Christ, the right One.&#8221; Jesus Christ certainly is the right One, the One who is right, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father. The reason we have a problem and the Father has a case against us is that we are wrong ones. Because we are the ones who are wrong, we need the righteous One to take care of our case.<p>In Acts 3:14 Peter calls the Lord Jesus the &#8220;Righteous One.&#8221; To be righteous is to be right with God and also with everyone and everything. Only the Lord Jesus can be called the Righteous One, because only He is right with God and with everyone and with everything. As the Righteous One, the Lord Jesus is the Right One. He was never wrong with God or with anyone or with anything. The righteousness of such a One should be also a portion of our enjoyment of Christ.<h2 class=head1>V. HOLINESS</h2><p>Another attribute of Christ is holiness. Speaking of Christ, the last part of Luke 1:35 says, &#8220;The holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.&#8221; As the conceiving of the Lord Jesus was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a holy thing, something intrinsically holy. This holy thing is Jesus our Savior. Hence, He has the divine attribute of holiness to qualify Him to be our Savior and our Sanctifier (Heb. 2:11).<p>In Acts 3:14 Peter refers to the Lord Jesus as the Holy One. In this verse &#8220;holy&#8221; indicates that Jesus, the Nazarene, the One despised by the Jewish leaders, was absolutely for God and separated unto Him. Furthermore, He was absolutely one with God. According to the denotation of the word &#8220;holy&#8221; in the Bible, this word signifies one who is absolutely unto God, who is absolutely for God, and who is absolutely one with God. Only the Lord Jesus is such a one. Throughout His entire life He was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God. Therefore, He is called the Holy One.<p>In Revelation 3:7 Christ refers to Himself as &#8220;the holy One.&#8221; By Him and through Him the church can be holy, separated from the world. Furthermore, in and through His holy nature the church is sanctified.<h2 class=head1>W. ABILITY</h2><p>In Hebrews 7:25, Matthew 9:28-30, Philippians 3:21, Hebrews 2:18, Revelation 5:3-5, and 6:1, the attribute of Christ&#8217;s ability is fully shown. Christ&#8217;s ability qualifies Him in His attributes of sympathy, mercy, compassion, meekness, forbearance, lowliness, self-humbling, obedience, faithfulness, truthfulness, righteousness, and holiness. He is able to do whatever He likes to do, and He is able to be whatever He wants to be. His unlimited ability is a unique attribute of His being.<h2 class=head1>X. WORTHINESS</h2><p>Revelation 5:12 tells us that Christ is the worthy One. Worthiness is one of His attributes which deserves our praise and appreciation. Christ&#8217;s worthiness comes from His qualification of what He is and what He has accomplished, especially of the success He has made through the process He has gone through. All His divine attributes and His human virtues are also the qualifications of His worthiness.</body></html>
