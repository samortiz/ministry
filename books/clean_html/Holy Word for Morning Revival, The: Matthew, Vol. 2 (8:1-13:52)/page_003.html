<p class="bold">WEEK 6 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 8:14-17</h2><p class="bold">14 &nbsp;And Jesus, coming into Peter’s house, saw <sup>1</sup>his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever.</p><p class="bold">15 &nbsp;And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And when evening fell, they brought to Him <sup>1</sup>many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and <sup>1</sup>all those who were ill He healed,</p><p class="bold">17 &nbsp;So that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “<sup>1</sup>He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases.”</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>14<sup>1</sup> Peter’s mother-in-law in vv. 14-15 represents the Jews living at the end of this age, who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior (Rom. 11:25-26). At that time, during the great tribulation, the Jews in the eyes of God will be “in a fever” (v. 14), “hot” in things other than God. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the kingly Savior will come back to this remnant of the Jews that they may be saved (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10). Peter’s mother-in-law was healed in Peter’s house. At the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel. Furthermore, they will be saved by the kingly Savior’s direct touch (v. 15), as was the Jewish leper (v. 3).</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> Many who were demon possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium. The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus, it is considered the “evening” of the old heaven and old earth. In the millennium the power to cast out demons and heal illnesses will be manifested to the uttermost. Hence, all the demon possessed and all the sick will be healed. Such extensive power is the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5). The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age. The signs recorded in vv. 2-17 bear a dispensational significance and show the coming kingdom in miniature.</p><p>The order of the four incidents recorded in vv. 2-16 differs from that in Mark 1:29—2:1 and Luke 4:38-41; 5:12-14; and 7:1-10. In Mark’s record, which shows that Jesus is the Servant of God, the order is according to history. In Matthew’s record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i.e., Matthew puts certain incidents together to present a doctrine. In Luke’s record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man’s Savior, the order is according to morality. In John’s record, which testifies that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, the order is somewhat according to history.</p><p>17<sup>1</sup> All healings accomplished on fallen people are a result of the Lord’s redemption. On the cross He took away our infirmities, bore our diseases, and accomplished full healing for us. However, in this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for [science, finance, education,] politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare.…But in their heat and fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality. [Nevertheless], at the Lord’s second coming, the Jews will be directly touched by His arrival and be saved.</p><p>Immediately after Peter’s mother-in-law was healed, she arose and served the Lord (v. 15). This signifies that at the Lord’s coming back, the remnant of the Jews, after being saved, will arise and serve Him in the millennium.
