<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Calling Hymns</H2><P>Now we need to consider our calling of hymns in the section of worshipping the Father at the Lord's table. We need to call hymns according to the Father's being. The Father's name was not revealed until the Lord Jesus came. He came to reveal the name of the Father (John 17:6, 26), the person of the Father. Thus, we have to call hymns according to the Father's person, the Father's being.</P><P>We also have to call hymns according to the Father's attributes, such as His love, His kindness, and His glory. In the table of contents of our hymnal under the section entitled "Worship of the Father," we have a number of hymns categorized according to the Father's attributes. These attributes include His faithfulness, His greatness, His wisdom, His mercy, and His love.</P><P>We praise the Son according to His person and work, but there is no work with regard to the Father. We should praise the Father according to His being and attributes. We have to differentiate and discern the hymns according to these two categories: the Father's being, what the Father is, and the Father's attributes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. By Presenting Christ to God the Father</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the Peace Offering</H2><P>In our worship of the Father, we need to present Christ to Him as the peace offering (Lev. 3). This section is very crucial. To share this with the saints, we need to be clear about the type of the peace offering in the book of Leviticus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Enjoying Him before God the Father</H2><P>At the Lord's table meeting, we enjoy Christ before God the Father (Lev. 7:14-21, 28-34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. As Life Supply</H2><P>First, we enjoy Christ as our life supply (vv. 14-16). In offering the peace offering, some bread and flesh of the offering was assigned to the priests for their food. That signifies the life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. As Love in Resurrection</H2><P>The breast of the offering was assigned to the priests as a wave offering. The breast signifies love and the offering being waved signifies resurrection, so this typifies Christ as love in resurrection to be our life supply (vv. 29-31).</P>
