<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Contrast between Doing Righteousness<br>in Wisdom and Doing Wickedness in Folly</H2><P>In chapters ten through nineteen many proverbs show us a contrast between doing righteousness in wisdom and doing wickedness in folly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Wisdom versus Folly</H2><P>The first contrast is the contrast between wisdom and folly. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother. The wise in heart will receive commandments, but the foolish in speech will be cast down. Wise men treasure up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool is imminent destruction (10:1, 8, 14). He who walks with wise men will be wise, but the companion of fools will be troubled (13:20). The tongue of the wise utters knowledge well, but the mouth of fools pours out folly. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother (15:2, 20). Insight is a fountain of life to him who has it, but the correction of fools is folly (16:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Righteousness versus Wickedness</H2><P>Righteousness is versus wickedness. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death (10:2). Blessings are upon the head of the righteous man, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. The memory of the righteous man is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot (vv. 6-7). The mouth of the righteous man is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence (v. 11). The wages of the righteous man lead to life; the income of the wicked man, to sin (v. 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Diligence versus Slothfulness</H2><P>A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps at harvest time is a son who brings shame (vv. 4-5). The hand of the diligent will rule, but the slothful will be under forced labor. The slothful man does not roast his game, but the precious substance of men is to the diligent (12:24, 27). The soul of the sluggard desires and has nothing, but the soul of the diligent will be made fat (13:4). He also who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a destroyer (18:9). Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and the idle soul will suffer hunger. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not even bring it back to his mouth (19:15, 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Integrity versus Crookedness</H2><P>He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be known (10:9).</P>
