What they have seen we inherit, so today we are standing on the shoulders of all the foregoing teachers of the Bible
In this first message we want to stress five things: the Triune God, His word, His revelation, His vision, and His move
After the Lord's speaking in many books, from Genesis to Matthew, He suddenly spoke of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Paul in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 told Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach other things, only the economy of God
Thank God that for nearly twenty centuries this spoken and written word has also been interpreted, taught, to God's people
God's revelation, from the beginning to the ending, is contained in His word and conveyed to us through His word
A late Chinese philosopher who was an ambassador to the United States read the Bible, but he received only the letter of the written word
We must confess all of our sins to make ourselves pure and clean, without any hindering thing between us and God
We receive the word of God by means of all prayer, by different prayers-by shouting, by quietness, by singing, etc
If a person's eyes are covered by a thick veil, there may be some wonderful scenery in front of him, but he is not able to see it
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said that when the sons of Israel read the books of Moses, they have a veil upon them and see nothing
Paul then said that whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away and that wherever the Spirit is, there is freedom
It is by the Spirit of God that we look unto the Lord with an unveiled face to be transformed into His image through the Lord Spirit
Every day we will receive revelation; the Spirit will also shine over the revelation, and we will receive a vision
At Moses' time God revealed to him that he should bring the law of God to God's people and build up the tabernacle
The Lord gradually gave him revelation so that he came to know what the Lord would do in the New Testament age
They do not know what God is doing today, so they establish things which are not in and according to the revelation of God
In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God's chosen people
We may say that the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, presents a shadow, and the New Testament presents the reality
There are five books of types, twelve of history, five of poetry, five of the major prophets, and twelve of the minor prophets
The types from Genesis to Deuteronomy unveil the Triune God embodied in Christ as the center and circumference of His eternal economy
All the above points present us a vivid portrait of the all-inclusive Christ in and for God's eternal economy in the Old Testament
In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God's chosen people
In the four sections of the Old Testament Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God's economy
Others may say that the Gospels reveal Christ in a fourfold way in Matthew as a king in Mark as a slave in Luke as a man and in John as God
Although this thought is very high, we want to go further to see the central, intrinsic revelation of the four Gospels
In 1 Corinthians 15:45, Paul said that the last Adam, the embodied God, God embodied in a man, became the life-giving Spirit
They said that 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, not the life-giving Spirit
The general teaching in today's Christianity says only that Christ is the Redeemer, not that Christ is our life and everything
In the four Gospels the church is mentioned only twice, in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17, but the Body of Christ is not mentioned
In this message we want to see the way to receive revelation from the holy Word and see vision through revelation
If we do not know that we have a spirit or how to exercise, to use, our spirit, we cannot receive revelation from the holy Word
Without the exercise of the spirit, the holy Word remains only in letters, in facts, but it cannot be a revelation to us
Some Christians, especially those who are Seventh-day Adventists, understand parts of the Bible by exercising their imagination
Thank God that today in the universe there is not only the divine Spirit or only the human spirit but also the mingled spirit
Basically, the way to receive revelation is by the mingled spirit, that is, by the divine Spirit indwelling the human spirit
God, the word, the Spirit, Christ, and our spirit are blended together through prayer so that we can receive revelation
The seeker and lover of Christ becomes five things the garden the sanctuary of God the heavenly bodies the terrible army and the Shulammite
The New Jerusalem, on the one hand, is God's dwelling place, and on the other hand, is Christ's wife, the Shulammite
There may be some wonderful scenery in front of us, but without the light, we cannot see a vision of this scenery
Paul saw a heavenly vision, and in this vision God charged Paul to move to preach the gospel to the Gentile world
The facts in Genesis 1 begin with God creating the heavens and the earth, and the earth becoming waste and void
Christ is the Spirit, the reality of God; Christ is the Word, the speaking of God; and Christ is the light, the shining of God
Also, the meal offering is made of fine flour of wheat for God's people to eat as their food in their fellowship with God
The animal life in the sea typifies the riches of the life of Christ in the power that overcomes death in His living
That is a picture of Christ's life in us, showing that we can live in this world against all the salt, the things of death
Eventually out of the dust of this land, God created a man in His image and after His likeness to represent and express Him
A popular Chinese translation translates the word spirit, the human spirit, as 'spirit-soul' or 'spirit-heart'
We have seen that we first need to get the facts from the Bible, but then we need to go on to receive revelation
From the place where the tree of life was, a river flowed out into four heads, and at the flow there were gold, bdellium, and onyx stone
God brought all the created things to man to see what man would call them, so Adam named all the living things
Jehovah caused man to sleep and took one of his ribs with which He built a wife to match man to be one body with man
The Sabbath divides the first section of God's creation without the life of God from the second section with the life of God
On the eighth day everything is centered on the life of God, because God put the man whom He had created before the tree of life
The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word for spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says that man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah
At the end of the Bible, the tree of life grows in the flow out of God's throne to supply the entire New Jerusalem
If Adam had partaken of the tree of life, he would have received life, but instead he partook of the other tree and received death
Many young people were helped by those messages which were concerning Hiram, the skillful builder of the pillars in God's temple
The apostle Paul received the highest education, being brought up at the feet of a learned rabbi named Gamaliel
After he was saved by the Lord, Paul's education and capacity came up in resurrection to be used by the Lord for the building up of His Body
At the end of the Bible in Revelation, there is a city built with three precious materials-gold, pearls, and precious stones
When He was on the cross, the soldiers came to break His legs, but when they saw that He had already died, they did not do it
John 19:36 says, 'For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 'No bone of His shall be broken'
It is very hard to receive revelation and even harder to see a vision from Genesis 1 and 2, the first two chapters of the Bible
In the first section of His creation, God created man only in His image and after His likeness outwardly, without the life of God inwardly
The second section of God's creation begins with His making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life
There are only three places in the Bible which mention three kinds of materials: Genesis 2, 1 Corinthians 3, and Revelation 21
Eventually, at the end of the Bible, the consummation of God's building is the New Jerusalem built with gold, pearl, and precious stones
Man has been regenerated in his spirit by receiving God as life, but his soul remains in the old creation of God
The man of the old creation has nothing to do with Christ, especially to be Christ's counterpart, Christ's wife
Genesis 2:22 in the Hebrew does not say that God made a woman of this rib but that He built this rib into a woman
The living water typifies Christ's resurrection life, which is also typified by the bone, the rib, in Genesis 2
The rib of Adam taken out of him signifies the unbreakable life of Christ, which flows as the living water of life
The record of the Bible goes on through God's incarnation, death, resurrection, and transforming work for the building up of Christ's Body
The following thirty-eight books of the Old Testament are full of types and prophecies of Christ and the church
The main prophecies concerning Christ are in Isaiah, which says that a virgin will bring forth a son whose name will be called Immanuel
Eventually, all the types and prophecies are fulfilled through the coming of Christ in the New Testament to carry out His eternal economy
The picture of God's new creation starts from Genesis 2 with God making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life
The life of God flows out of the regenerated believers to transform them into precious materials for the building of God
Most Christians know this in a general way, but they do not know how to convert the Word of God into revelation
The things which transpire with the ascended Christ in the heavens are much more than what transpired with Him on earth
The second major item was His ascending to the heavens to be appointed, anointed, and established by God to work out God's economy
Antichrist and the false prophet will then be cast into the lake of fire, leaving one enemy, one big rebel, Satan
The Bible in the New Testament tells us that Christ has been established by God to judge the living and the dead
The goats will go to the lake of fire to be with Antichrist, and the sheep will be sent into the sphere of eternal life
At the end of the thousand years, God in His economy will allow Satan to be released to accomplish something for God
After He finishes His heavenly ministry, He will come back to judge the believers, to determine who the overcomers are
The New Testament is the biography of a Person whose story begins in eternity past and ends in eternity future
In eternity past He is by Himself as the Triune God, but in eternity future He will be with His companion, His wife
The Triune God in eternity future will have a wife, a counterpart, as the consummation of the Body of Christ to match Him
In the previous message we saw the facts concerning the Triune God's revelation and His move in the New Testament
The human living of the man Jesus on earth is to express God in man through His divine attributes expressed in the human virtues of Jesus
Jesus said He was like a grain of wheat, and God's divine life was contained within the shell of this grain, the shell of Christ's humanity
The cross broke this shell to release the divine life so that this divine life could be dispensed into Christ's believers
In the first ministry, the earthly ministry, He consummated one major thing, that is, to impart the Triune God into His redeemed
God was not only brought into man but man was also brought into God, making man and God, God and man, one spirit
In His heavenly ministry He consummates a major thing, that is, to build up the regenerated believers into His Body
He is the God-established Minister to minister all His unsearchable riches with heaven to His believers for their growth in life
Christ is the God-ordained Mediator of the new covenant to execute what He has accomplished in the new covenant to the believers
Christ is also the God-ordained surety of the new covenant to guarantee the sure fulfillment of the new covenant to the believers
On the other hand, at the same time, He is the transforming Spirit to transform all the believers into the new creation
Christians today altogether mix up the earthly and heavenly ministries of Christ and the different works of these two ministries
The upcoming kingdom and the upcoming New Jerusalem both depend upon the overcomers produced by the building up of the Body of Christ
The overcomers, after being married to Christ to be His bride, become His army to fight against all the opposers of God
In Christ's second coming, He will gather all His believers to the judgment seat which He will set up in the air
Christ will discern the overcomers and award them with His kingdom for them to enter into His co-kingship and joy
He will marry all the overcomers collectively as His bride, His counterpart, who will be exactly the same as He is to match Him
The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in eternity will be a common enjoyment to all the believers
Day after day we should do our best to live a God-man's life, which will make us the real overcomers of Christ
He will erase your name out of the book of life if you are a defeated believer, not for eternity, but for one thousand years of discipline
If we do not live an overcoming life today, our names will be erased from the book of life for one thousand years
Today thousands of believers do not know anything concerning the thousandyear kingdom of Christ with the possibility of reward or discipline
When you go to the gate of the kingdom, the gatekeepers will tell you that your ticket means nothing and that you cannot enter
Even to enter into the New Jerusalem, you have to pass through the eyes of the angels through whom the law was ordained
Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly
At the end of the kingdom, God temporarily will release Satan, who will seduce the nations again to fight against God
Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry
Without such a kingdom ministry, how could the earth created by God be cleared up to be good for God's kingdom?
There is the need of such a kingdom ministry of Christ to clear the earth from all the opposing factors of man plus Satan
The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God's eternal enlargement and expression
These revelations continue through His human living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, His crucifixion, and His resurrection
Through this process, the early disciples saw the historical facts of Christ's work, but they did not have the revelation
They saw Jesus Christ as a man manifesting God in His humanity, but they did not see the revelation of God in His economy
On the day of Pentecost, Peter would have even more realization that Christ was in him as the One who is in the Father and the Father in Him
In this vision Christ firstly charged His disciples to go out based upon what they had seen to preach repentance for the forgiveness of sins
The revelations in the Lord's earthly ministry began from the incarnation and consummated with His resurrection
By the Lord's move shown in the above four points the Lord covered Asia and Africa and initiated His church among the Gentiles
The Lord gave Paul a further vision, the vision of the Macedonian call , to direct his gospel trip from Asia to eastern Europe
Our revelation and vision have been greatly uplifted in the last three years because we have seen the high peaks of God's revelation
These are mainly concerning God becoming a man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
All the groups in Christianity have been stranded on their own sands, like a boat stranded on sands in shallow water
The ones mentioned in Psalm 84 passed through a way full of tears, sufferings, but they made it a place of springs
We have seen the revelations based upon the Old Testament facts and the new revelations based upon the New Testament facts
We have also seen the visions with God's move in the Old Testament and the New Testament visions with God's move in the New Testament
