   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But there is something more that we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time we repented to take the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we did not realize that we were so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may have realized that we were not so good and that we had done many wrong things, but we never realized that we are just sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether we intend to do something sinful or we do not intend to do something sinful, we are just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the word "unwittingly" is used in Leviticus 4.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin unwittingly against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: if the priest that is anointed do sin so as to bring guilt on the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering" Lev 4:1-3, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>. For this word "unwittingly" we could also use "unwillingly," "ignorantly," "unaware," or "inadvertently."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a picture, and it means that we must realize while we are enjoying the Lord as our burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering, we are just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of whether we have the intention of hating others or not, eventually we will hate them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether we are willing to lose our temper or not, we will simply lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may not even like to be proud, but we will certainly be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what Paul is talking about in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He says that the things he hates to do, that is what he does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He does not want to do it, yet he does it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps in the morning we make a decision not to gossip at all that day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But during the day we gossip more than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We make a decision not to criticize others anymore, yet an hour later we are very critical of someone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul says in Romans 7:17, "Now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not I, but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Galatians 2:20, we have this word: "No longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 7 says that it is not I, but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is another person as in Galatians 2:20, but this person's name is not Christ; this person's name is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His first name is sin, his last name is sin, and his middle name is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sin!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may think that we are doing a wonderful deed, but eventually we may discover that what we had done was terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the time we did it, we thought it was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it turned out to be awful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What does this prove?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It simply proves that within us there is something called sin, and this sin is just ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SOURCE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Leviticus 4 is very difficult for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I was a young Christian, I tried for many years to understand this chapter, but I failed to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First of all, this chapter says that if a priest does something wrong unwittingly, he must offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then it says that if the congregation of the Lord's people does something unwittingly, they must offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later it says that if a ruler among the people does something wrong unwittingly, he must offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And it even mentions that if a common person does anything wrong unwittingly, he must offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this picture, we can realize that this is a congregation that is worshiping and serving God, which is exactly what we are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are simply a congregation that worships God by enjoying Christ as our burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may think that we are getting along quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are in the recovery of the church life, so whatever we do surely must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, it may seem right today, but after three weeks, we may discover that what we did three weeks ago was horrible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This chapter first mentions that the leading serving one may do something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet he may think that it is one hundred percent correct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does it unwittingly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a certain time, he discovers that it was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a kind of mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is something out of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our inward being is just sin; therefore, what comes out cannot be right.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This chapter goes on to say that the whole congregation, a ruler in the congregation, or a common person in the congregation may do something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of these persons do something wrong unwittingly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The picture here shows us that within us there is something that always causes us to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This chapter does not deal with mistakes or wrong doing; it deals with the source of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the source of our mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may say that it is sin, but this can be just a doctrinal answer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must realize that we are the source of all our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there were no one in the local church, surely the local church would never make any mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the more brothers and sisters there are, the more mistakes will be made.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we had only ten brothers and sisters meeting together, surely the mistakes could never be as many as we have today; today we have almost one thousand sources.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This chapter does not deal with mistakes, but with the source of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And that is our very self.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we need Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Within every drop of our blood and every fiber of our muscle is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are simply constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And because we are sin, we need a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord that Christ is our sin offering!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ was made sin for us.</S>
