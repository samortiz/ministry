Although Saul's history is neither positive nor encouraging, I believe that our study of it will be quite encouraging to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HIS ORIGIN</H2><P>In 9:1 and 2 we have a word regarding Saul's origin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Of the Tribe of Benjamin</H2><P>Saul was of the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe (v. 1a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Of His Father, Kish</H2><P>Saul's father Kish was a man of wealth (vv. 1b, 2a). The Hebrew word for "wealth" here may also be rendered "valor." Kish was a man rich in wealth and perhaps rich also in valor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Named Saul</H2><P>The name Saul means "asked for" (v. 2b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. A Handsome Young Man</H2><P>Saul was a handsome young man (v. 2c). The Hebrew word for "young" in verse 2 also means "choice." As a young man, or, a man of choice, Saul was a choice to people. The fact that he was handsome, or, comely, indicates that he was attractive to people. Humanly speaking, Saul was a good choice for king.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
