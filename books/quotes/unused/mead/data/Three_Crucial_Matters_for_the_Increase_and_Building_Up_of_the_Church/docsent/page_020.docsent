   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COOPERATION OF THE FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have brothers and sisters in almost every community in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most effective way is for the full-time trainees to coordinate with these brothers and sisters and go with them to knock on doors and visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to receive a burden to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many communities in Taipei that are equivalent to a village.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is worthwhile for us to labor in these communities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If one thousand full-time brothers and sisters coordinate with the saints living in the communities, the result will be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This requires our prayer, and it requires all the brothers and sisters to pick up the burden and to spend their money and energy on this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints can go out in the gospel, and they can also support the full-time brothers and sisters so that the full-time serving ones can offer all their time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is like an army fighting for the kingdom of God on the earth; therefore, we must give our all our strength, time, and money for God s interest on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that we should not take care of our practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, for the Lord s sake we should live a normal life and take care of the education of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the Lord gives us any surplus, we should refuse to spend it on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should give the surplus to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are willing to do this, it will be very easy to gospelize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will bring a great blessing to our society and to our country.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Idols are prevalent in Taiwan, and crime has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These conditions indicate that there is a desperate need for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must spread the preaching of the gospel because we live in this age and we have received a burden from the Lord to spread His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The last chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, which is a book on the gospel of the kingdom, speaks of the Lord s ultimate commission.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this chapter the Lord charges us to go and disciple all the nations because He has received all authority in heaven and on earth 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to go so that the Gentiles can become not only believers but also the Lord s disciples, that is, those who spread the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must go and baptize people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the commission that the Lord gave us, and we must receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are now in the Lord s particular move in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has opened a wide door for the spread of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a good environment, so we should give ourselves and take advantage of this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be mobilized and give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should give Him our heart, strength, money, family, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do this, we will see a glorious situation in the gospelization of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A LARGE MEETING HALL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been progressing positively with respect to acquiring a large meeting hall in Linkou.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The land we purchased is on a hillside, and the government has many regulations concerning the development of hillside property.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These regulations do not depend on whether the property is forestland or farmland.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we must go through the proper procedures and apply for a permit to develop the land.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some saints asked why we need a large meeting hall when we are promoting the burden for the small groups and home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle in the Bible shows that we need both the big meetings and the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These meetings can be compared to the two wings of a bird or an airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The big meetings are one wing, and the small meetings are the other wing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Based on the experience we gained this year, we know that even though there are many activities in the small meetings, we still need the strengthening from the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, we need a large meeting hall so that the saints from localities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung can gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though there are small group meetings all over the city of Taipei, we still need a big meeting for everyone to attend at least once a month and a larger meeting every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the future we hope to have two thousand five hundred full-time brothers and sisters being trained each term.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The place where they can meet and have training classes is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Presently we are unable to receive the saints from overseas into the training, because of the limitations in our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have a place with a dormitory and a dining hall, we can accept the saints from abroad to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This would save both time and effort.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Taipei is a large city in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a highly industrialized and commercial city, and the number of people living in the communities is steadily increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This makes Taipei a large fishing pond; it is one of the best places for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we need to pay attention to the development of our work and labor in one accord for the building of the big meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the same time we should pay attention to the spread of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should seriously consider these things before the Lord, and we should look to Him that the work in these two areas would proceed simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not stop the work in the communities in order to focus on the development of the large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do this, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must work toward the building of the large meeting hall at Linkou and, at the same time, put our strength, time, and money into developing the work in the communities.</S>
