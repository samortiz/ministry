   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A GENERAL WORD CONCERNING THE SEALS,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE TRUMPETS, AND THE BOWLS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seals are unveiled in secret, while the trumpets are sounded in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament, the blowing of the trumpet was a solemn occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, this book is also quite solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 1:10 and 4:1 say, "like a trumpet."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seventh seal produces the seven trumpets, while the seventh trumpet includes the seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The seven trumpets that come out of the seventh seal are sequential and extend over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the fifth trumpet lasts for five months 9:5 , while the sixth trumpet lasts for at least thirteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, Revelation 10:7 and 11:2-3 together show that the seventh trumpet lasts for about three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to 11:15, after the seventh trumpet is sounded, the kingdom of Christ will come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seven bowls included in the seventh trumpet equal the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The time for the pouring out of the seven bowls is the time for the blowing of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is unlike the seven trumpets included in the seventh seal, which extend over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the seventh trumpet is sounded, there will be very little time left.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To facilitate our understanding, we have the following chart:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The opening of the seven seals takes approximately two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But one can only see what is written in the scroll after the seventh seal is opened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The seventh seal includes the seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the first through the sixth trumpets have sounded, one still cannot see what is written in the scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is only at the time of the seventh trumpet that the scroll is opened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the seventh trumpet is over, the kingdom will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By then we will see the new covenant and the blessings God has prepared on earth Jer 31:31-34; 33:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seals extend over a period of time, and the trumpets also extend over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there is a difference between the trumpets and the seals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seals will damage one fourth of the earth Rev 6:8 , while the trumpets will damage one third of the earth 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The beginning of the seventh trumpet is the beginning of the first bowl.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The end of the seventh trumpet is the end of the seventh bowl.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, this trumpet will last for at least three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 10:7 corresponds with Romans 16:25-26, and Revelation 11:15 is at the end of the seventh trumpet, when the kingdom is about to come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In between these two verses are three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 11:3 mentions three and a half years 42 months, 1260 days .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 12:6 and 14 also mention three and a half years 1260 days and "a time and times and half a time" .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 11:7 the completion of the two witnesses' tesitimony will come after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can say that the seventh seal "begets" the seven trumpets, while the seventh trumpet includes the seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The seven bowls describe the condition of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we compare "Your wrath" in Revelation 11:15-18 with "the fury of God" in Revelation 15:1, we can see that the seven bowls are the fury of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seals are opened in heaven in secret, while the trumpets are sounded on earth and are heard by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The bowls are physical and are not a mere sound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The opening of the seals is the judgment in the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the believers know where these things such as famine, earthquake, and swords originate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are not known to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, they are hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sounding of the trumpets signifies a change of dispensation; the dispensation of the gospel has ended.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter seven is on the sealing of the Israelites and the rapture of the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Chapter eight is a declaration of war.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The trumpets convey the sense of announcement, while the bowls signify wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament, there is the "cup of wrath."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But here, the bowl of wrath is stronger than the cup of wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the following arguments we can see that the tribulations of the seven trumpets are real tribulations:</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1 The book of Revelation is not a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2 The sounding of the trumpets is audible and is not hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever is sounded is what they signify.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the sounding of the last trumpet, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, the first to the sixth trumpets are also miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>3 The seventh trumpet brings God's judgment to men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4 All the prophecies in the Old Testament, whether concerning judgment or the coming of the Lord, are to be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why then should it be different in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since the ten plagues in Exodus were literal, why should the tribulations in Revelation not be interpreted literally?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>5 By Revelation 7 the age of the church is over, and God has returned to the position of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, as such, all the judgments have to be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Micah 7:15 says that God will execute judgment like He did in Egypt, only it will be a greater judgment Isa 11:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Moreover, Jeremiah 23:7 and 8 say that God will execute a deliverance greater than that in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It therefore follows that the tribulations will be greater than those at the time of the exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>6 The "marvels" prophesied in Exodus 34:10 will be fulfilled at the time of the sounding of the seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>7 The "great and persistent plagues" mentioned in Deuteronomy 28:59 are all "extraordinary."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's judgments are always carried out through miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>8 The Lord said that the day of the Son of Man will be like the days of Noah and of Lot Luke 17:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the time of Noah, God opened up the window of heaven and poured down rain.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the time of Lot, God sent fire from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These were miraculous judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>9 God has to show men that He is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In men's eyes, many calamities are only changes in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But to turn water into blood, and to turn only one third of it, proves that it is not a common change in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, it has to be an act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Man is saturated with sin, and God has to come in to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The "great tribulation" in Matthew 24:21-28 concerns the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is the persecution of Antichrist on the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The earliest this persecution will start is at the sounding of the fifth trumpet Rev 9:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Actually, it starts at the seventh trumpet because only then do the events concerning Antichrist begin to transpire 10:7; 11:2; 12:12; 13:1-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The "hour of trial" in Revelation 3:10 is for the whole world, while the "great tribulation" in Matthew 24:21-28 is for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The "hour of trial" of Revelation 3:10 begins from the time of the first trumpet, while the "great tribulation" of Matthew 24:21-28 will start, at the earliest, with the sounding of the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Strictly speaking, it will start with the sounding of the seventh trumpet; otherwise, the world would persecute the Israelites those who belong to God even more.</S>
