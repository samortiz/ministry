According to this record, before the first forty days Moses spent on the mountain with God, his relationship with God was not yet one of intimacy. But in the incident of the making of the golden calf, we see that Moses and God had an intimate talk. This indicates the beginning of Moses&rsquo; intimacy with God. Moses knew what was on God&rsquo;s heart. He came down from the mountain, cast away the tablets, ground the golden calf into powder, and forced the people to drink water on which this powder had been sprinkled. He also called for a group of overcomers to slay the idolaters. Moses did all this according to God&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>Moses knew that God did not want to give up the children of Israel. But he also knew that God needed a way out of the problem between Him and His people. If we read Exodus 32 and 33 carefully, we shall see that Moses had the assurance that he could work out the problem with God concerning the inexcusable offense committed by the people. Moses knew that he could appease God in this situation. In 32:30 Moses seemed to be saying to the children of Israel, &ldquo;You have committed such a great sin that it seems you cannot be forgiven. What you have done is altogether inexcusable. But I shall go to make propitiation for you.&rdquo; Moses had the assurance that propitiation could be made, for, as a result of staying with God on the mountaintop for forty days, he knew what was on God&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>During the forty days he was with God, Moses gained a thorough knowledge of God&rsquo;s heart concerning the children of Israel. Moses knew that God wanted this people to be His own, that He wanted to take them for His bride. Moses knew that not even the people&rsquo;s sin of worshipping the golden calf could change the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. Although this offense created an extremely difficult problem, Moses had the assurance that God could be propitiated. He knew God&rsquo;s heart, and he knew the way to approach Him concerning His people.</p><p>As those who would serve God, we also need to know what is on God&rsquo;s heart. Many Christians today emphasize the fact that we need to take the Word of God. Of course, we must know God&rsquo;s Word and take it. However, if Moses had done nothing more than take the word of God, there would have been no way for him to work out a reconciliation between God and the people. The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Whoever has sinned against Me, I will wipe him out from My book&rdquo; (32:33). That was God&rsquo;s word, but was it the intent of God&rsquo;s heart? No, it was not. God&rsquo;s word was one thing, but the desire of His heart may have been something else. Moses realized that God said that He was about to wipe out the people. But, knowing God&rsquo;s heart, Moses also realized that He would not give up His people. As the middleman between God and the children of Israel, Moses knew what was on God&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>When Moses came to God about this situation, he did not pray in a religious way. He did not say, as we probably would do, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You are full of mercy.&rdquo; According to 32:31 and 32, Moses spoke to the Lord in an intimate way, like a man talking to a close friend.</p><p>It is not sufficient merely for us to know the Word concerning the economy of God and the ground of the church. If you know the Word concerning God&rsquo;s economy and the church, you may be only a man of the Word, but not a man according to God&rsquo;s heart. In addition to knowing the Word, we all must come to know God&rsquo;s heart. This is especially needed among the elders. All the elders should be those who are according to God&rsquo;s heart. With Moses in Exodus 32 and 33, we see a man who is not only right in all he does; we see a man who knows what is on God&rsquo;s heart and who is according to God&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>The sin committed by the children of Israel in worshipping the golden calf caused a problem not only to God, but also to Moses. Moses may have said to himself, &ldquo;What should I do about this? This whole situation may cause Pharaoh and the Egyptians to mock us and to mock God.&rdquo; We are not told, however, that Moses considered the situation for a long period of time, or that he fasted and prayed to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. There is no indication that Moses questioned whether he should go back to the Lord concerning the matter. Rather, immediately after he dealt with the idolaters, he told the children of Israel that they had sinned a great sin, but that he would seek to make propitiation for them. Moses could do this because he was clear concerning the situation of the children of Israel and especially concerning the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. During those forty days on the mountaintop, the Lord surely did not leave Moses alone for long periods of time and then occasionally speak something about the tabernacle and its furniture. Moses and the Lord may have had some lengthy conversations. As a result of his intimate fellowship with God, Moses knew the real situation among the people, and he also had the assurance that he could appease the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_563.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_565.html">Next</a> </body></html>
