<P>Before we go further to see the matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens, let us first review what we have covered earlier. After the Lord was born, there was one who pioneered the way for Him. That one was John, and he preached, saying, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near." After him, the Lord also preached this, and He sent out the apostles also to preach the same thing. Actually, what does it mean to say that "the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near"? Later on, we see the Lord healing diseases and casting out demons. This is very much related to the drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Matthew chapters five through seven speak concerning the nature of the kingdom of the heavens: absolute righteousness toward oneself, absolute graciousness toward others, and doing deeds in absolute secrecy toward God. Chapter ten is on the Lord's sending out the apostles. Chapters eleven and twelve are a big turning point. It seems that the kingdom of the heavens is taken back from the Jews. Concerning the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen, Scofield said that the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens are just the kingdom of the heavens, which is mysterious. This does not make sense according to logic.</P><P>The Lord Jesus, John, and the disciples all said that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near. The Lord also declared the nature of the kingdom of the heavens. After the Israelites rejected the Lord, He spoke in chapter thirteen of the kingdom of the heavens in its boundary, its outward appearance (everything in the present age is outward), not the kingdom of the heavens in its nature. Mr. Meyer said that chapters five through seven speak of the nature of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen, one must be of the same nature as the kingdom. But this does not make sense either, because the kingdom of the heavens in chapter thirteen has tares, leaven, etc. Therefore, chapter thirteen speaks of the kingdom of the heavens only in its outward appearance as the boundary.</P><P>The kingdom of the heavens is not the millennium. It is the ruling part in the millennium. The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: (1) the outward appearance as the boundary, as presented in chapter thirteen; (2) our learning to go on by righteousness and grace under the authority of God—this is the aspect of spiritual conduct and is spoken of in chapters five through seven; and (3) our reigning together with the Lord Jesus in the future, in the millennium—this is the future reward spoken of in chapters five through seven.</P><P>Therefore, first we must enter into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens. We must change to another kingdom and become the people of the kingdom of the heavens. Second, we must have the spiritual reality and conduct presented in Matthew 5—7. Third, the result will be our reigning together with Christ.</P><P>There are three categories of people today. First, there are those who have entered into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, yet they have not been saved. Second, there are those who have been saved, have entered into the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, and have attempted to keep the teachings in chapters five through seven, but have failed. Third, there are those who have been saved, have kept the teachings in chapters five through seven, and have truly overcome; they will end with the third point mentioned above, which is to reign with the Lord in the future.</P><P>The kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are different, but they are inseparable.</P><P>(1) In the first aspect: with some of the parables, while Matthew said, "The kingdom of the heavens is like...," Luke said, "The kingdom of God is like..." From this we can see that the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are equal. This means that, on the level of the outward appearance, or the boundary, the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the kingdom of God, as shown in the parable of the leaven.</P><P>(2) In the second aspect: however, the kingdom of the heavens is not equal to the kingdom of God. The second aspect of the kingdom of the heavens deals with the matter of conduct, as seen in chapters five through seven. On the other hand, the kingdom of God is a matter of peace and joy in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is a spiritual matter, while the kingdom of the heavens deals with spiritual conduct. (To enter into the kingdom of God is merely to go in, whereas to see the kingdom of God is to see its reality.)</P><P>(3) In the third aspect: the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God are the same, again, in that both refer to the reigning in the millennium.</P><P>Although in the first aspect the kingdom of God is equal to the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God includes an additional period; that is, the sovereignty of God spoken of by the prophets in the Old Testament refers to the ruling of the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>In the third aspect, not only our reigning with the Lord for one thousand years is the kingdom of God, but to eternity it is the reigning of God. In eternity, the kingdom of the heavens will have passed, and the kingdom of God will be reigning. Therefore, in the third aspect, the kingdom of God has one more period than the kingdom of the heavens. In a certain sense, the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of the heavens, but not vice versa.</P>
