<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE ISSUE OF THE FALL AND<br />
THE WAY TO ESCAPE IT</h2>
<p>Genesis 5 shows the ultimate issue of the fall and the way to escape it. On the surface, this chapter is the record of a genealogy. However, we should not treat this chapter merely as a genealogy, because God uses words very economically. Every word and every sentence in the Bible is concise. Nothing is written without a reason. This chapter of genealogy must have a deep meaning. We must find its intrinsic significance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Issue Being Death</h2>
<p>Although Genesis 3 and 4 unveil the two falls of man, they do not show the ultimate issue of the fall. In chapter 5, however, we see the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall and the way to escape it.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is written in a very particular way. This account of Adam and his descendants uses three words&mdash;<em>begot, lived,</em> and <em>died</em>. For example, Adam died, Seth died, and Enosh died. Except for Enoch, who walked with God and was not, for God took him (v. 24), all the rest died. Therefore, the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall is death. If someone is going to write our biography, the last word would be either death or burial. A biography usually starts with birth and ends with death and burial. Death is the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall. No matter how powerful and accomplished a person may be, he will eventually die, because death is the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Escape Death</h2>
<p>The ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall is death. The way to escape death is unveiled in chapter 5.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking with God by Not Overstepping God<br />
and by Taking God as the Center</h2>
<p>The way to escape death is to walk with God. Man&rsquo;s first fall was his overstepping of God. The second fall was man&rsquo;s putting God aside. In chapter 5, however, there was a man, Enoch, who walked with God (v. 22); he took God as his center and did not turn away from God or abandon God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>What would it mean if we reversed the order of <em>Enoch</em> and <em>God</em> in verse 22 and said that God walked with Enoch? What is the difference between God walking with Enoch, and Enoch walking with God? If God walked with Enoch, then Enoch would have been the center and the lord, but God was the center and the Lord because Enoch walked with God. Enoch did not take himself as the center or assume the headship. Rather, he took God as his center and his head. He followed God and walked with God.</p>
<p>Man fell and ended up in death because he overstepped God and assumed the headship and because he put aside God&rsquo;s will and followed his own will. As a result, man forsook God, took the way of death, and fell into death. God is life. If we want to escape death, we must touch life; that is, we need to follow God, taking Him as our center, our Lord, and our Head. We should not overstep Him or put His will aside; rather, we should walk with Him.</p>
<p>When we overstep God and put His will aside, we will touch death and fall into death. When we drop our human opinions and focus on God&rsquo;s will, taking Him as our center in everything, we will escape the way of death. God is life. Hence, when we touch Him, we touch life. This is a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Believing In God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>Genesis 5:21-22 says, &ldquo;Enoch lived sixty-five years and begot Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methuselah three hundred years.&rdquo; Why did Enoch walk with God after he begot Methuselah? The name <em>Methuselah</em> means &ldquo;when he is dead, it [the judgment of the flood] will be sent.&rdquo; If we study the Bible carefully, we will see that the name Methuselah was actually a prophecy. According to Genesis 4 and 6, by the time of Enoch mankind had become extremely evil. Enoch had a God-fearing heart, became a prophet of God, and received inspiration from God, knowing that one day God would execute judgment upon the corrupted generation of mankind. After Enoch begot a son, he must have been inspired by the Holy Spirit to know that his generation would be judged on the day of his son&rsquo;s death. Therefore, having a God-fearing heart, Enoch named his son Methuselah. God used this name to warn Enoch and the people who were living then that the judgment would come when Methuselah died. No one knew when he would die, but Enoch took heed to the warning. He was in fear and trembling and dared not act carelessly. This is the way that he walked with God.</p>
<p>Enoch walked with God three hundred years, which was six hundred years before the death of Methuselah. Enoch&rsquo;s life was short, because people at that time lived at least six hundred or seven hundred years. Therefore, Enoch was taken while he was still young and strong. This was God&rsquo;s mercy to him so that he did not have to remain on the earth. It was sufficient for him to walk with God for three hundred years, so he was taken. Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years and begot Lamech (v. 25). Lamech lived a hundred eighty-two years and begot a son named Noah (vv. 28-29). Noah lived six hundred years, and the flood came (7:6, 11). When the flood came, Methuselah was exactly nine hundred and sixty-nine years old.</p>
<p>Enoch walked with God, and he also believed God&rsquo;s word. Walking with God means not overstepping God. Believing God&rsquo;s word means not putting God&rsquo;s will aside. We know that Enoch believed God&rsquo;s word, because when Enoch begot a son at the age of sixty-five, he received a revelation from the Holy Spirit concerning God&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;When he is dead, it [the judgment of the flood] will be sent.&rdquo; Enoch named his son Methuselah according to this revelation because he believed this word, and he walked with a heart that feared God.</p>
<p>By walking with God and believing God&rsquo;s word, Enoch escaped the factors of the two falls. The first fall was due to man&rsquo;s assuming the headship, and the second fall was due to man&rsquo;s putting aside God&rsquo;s will. Enoch overcame these two factors. He did not assume the headship, and he walked with God, taking God as his center. He did not hold on to his own opinions. Rather, he believed God&rsquo;s word. He believed what God said to him; hence, he took the way of escaping death. If we want to escape the issue of death, we also need to learn these two points. First, we should not overstep God but return to Him and allow Him to be our Head and Lord. Second, we should put aside our views and opinions, believe His word, and accept His will. Then we will overcome the factors of the two falls, and we will escape death. This is the intrinsic significance of Genesis 5.</p>
