   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter three John the Baptist declared the kingdom of the heavens, in chapter four the Lord proclaimed the kingdom of the heavens, and in chapter five the Lord spoke concerning the law and principle of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is this portion, Matthew 5 7, spoken to Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, insofar as the term "disciples" is concerned, this passage is spoken to Christians:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 In verses 1-2, although there were crowds, only the disciples went up to the mountain with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord did not consider the crowds as His "disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the disciples were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 Some say that the disciples mentioned in verse 1 were the Jewish disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this is not what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Lord says, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 13:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we see that this word is not spoken to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples to "disciple all the nations," that is, to make the Gentiles the Lord's disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no such thing as "Gentile" disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From Acts 11:26 we know that disciples are equivalent to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From Matthew to Acts, all who believed in the Lord, whether Gentiles or Jews, were called disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, insofar as the Lord's word is concerned, this passage is spoken to Christians:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 In His charge in Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord said, " Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of all the Lord's commands in the Gospels, none surpasses those given in Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may say that Matthew 5 7 is the center of all the Lord's commands and contains the Lord's most important commands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, this passage is spoken to Christians and should be observed by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 John 14:26 shows us that the work of the Holy Spirit is to remind the disciples of all the things that the Lord Jesus said while He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most important part of the work of the Holy Spirit is to lead us back to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 What did Paul say concerning the word of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Colossians 3:16 he said it is "the word of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not say "the word of God," because the word of God refers to the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here he mentioned specifically "the word of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul wrote Colossians while he was in prison, after the mystery of the church had been revealed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Third, insofar as its contents are concerned, this portion is spoken to Christians:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 In Matthew 5 7 when we read words such as "you have heard that it was said to the ancients" and "but I say to you," we know that this portion is not concerned with the law of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians are not under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they are not without law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, they are under the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2 In Matthew 5 7 expressions such as "Father who is in the heavens" and "brother" are often mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that this portion does not refer to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it is related to a group of people who have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3 We can find many teachings in the Epistles that are similar to those in Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, Romans 12 has a number of teachings similar to those in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4 If Matthew 5 7 contains the law of the millennial kingdom, how can there be "the unjust," "the evil," the robber, and the adulterer in that kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 3-9 speak concerning nine blessings:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 3:"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For one to be poor in spirit means that he is void of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens" the definition of the kingdom of the heavens cannot be determined here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we may say that it is a reward or more than a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 4:"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Mourn" indicates that God wants us to be pessimists in the world who react negatively toward the world, for the world will not get any better Luke 17:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 5:"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be meek is to put up no resistance but to endure all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such people will lose the things in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, they will inherit the earth in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 6:"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Righteousness" refers, in particular, to our personal righteousness in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, to take advantage of others is to be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It does not say, "Blessed are the righteous," because it is difficult to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, it says "hunger and thirst for righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to seek after righteousness as a hungry and thirsty person seeking for food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a one, therefore, will be satisfied.</S>
