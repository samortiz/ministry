In 1949 Watchman Nee released a series of messages on authority and submission in a co-workers' training held in Kuling, Foochow
At the end of this age, how can the kingdom of God be brought in if the children of God do not bear a testimony for the Lord in submission?
All things have been created by the authority of God, and all laws on earth are held together through authority
Isaiah 14 tells us that Satan violated God's authority, while Ezekiel 28 tells us that he violated God's holiness
Rather, Satan's rebellion against God's authority, for which he was condemned by God, subsequently gave rise to sin
There is a possibility in God's work that we can stand in principle on Satan's side, while we stand in doctrine on Christ's side
Satan showed the Lord all the kingdoms of the earth, but the Lord said that all the kingdom of the heavens is God's
After he met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he realized that it was difficult to kick against the goads with his feet
At his conversion, Paul was brought not only into a realization of God's salvation, but also into a realization of God's authority
Unless a man meets authority on the way to 'Damascus,' he cannot submit to an insignificant, small brother in 'Damascus'
We should only think of the authority, not of the person, because our submission is not to a person but to God's authority in that person
If we touch the matter of authority first and then submit to the person, irrespective of who he is, we are on the right path
We who are so self-confident, but who are in reality so blind, have to come face-to-face at least once with God's authority
If it had not been God's will for Him to be crucified, the Lord Jesus very well could have disregarded the cross
After He was clear, the 'cup' became the 'cup' that the Father had given to Him, and it and God's will became one thing
At the same time, when He understood that drinking the cup was the will of God, He immediately said, 'Arise, let us be going'
Since the cross means the accomplishment of God's will, the Lord's death is the highest expression of submission to authority
Saul could offer up sheep and oxen, but God would not recognize that as a sacrifice because the principle of Satan was present
The Bible says that rebellion is like the sin of divination, and insubordination is like idolatry and teraphim
Again in Acts 23 when Paul was judged, after he realized that Ananias was the high priest of God, he readily submitted
Otherwise, our work will not be in the principle of God's will, which is the principle of submission to authority
In Matthew 7:21-23 the Lord rebuked those who prophesied, cast out demons, and performed many wonderful works in His name
Following this word, the Lord said that only those who do the Father's will can enter the kingdom of the heavens
We cannot serve God on the one hand, while taking the way of rebellion with a spirit of rebellion on the other hand
Although a rebellious person can preach, Satan will laugh, because the principle of Satan is there in the preaching
We can lead God's children in the proper path only when we know God's authority and have learned the lesson of submission
God entrusted all creation to Adam's authority so that Adam would manage and be the authority over all the creation
For this reason, wherever we go, our first thought should be to find those to whom the Lord wants us to submit
She saw that the fruit was good for food and pleasant to the eyes, so she took liberty and made the decision herself
Before she stretched forth her hand to pick the fruit, she first used her head to think and receive the temptation
When Adam took the fruit, the first question that should have been asked was whether or not this was in submission to God
After man received of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he found a source of discerning between right and wrong apart from God
Our position is to be under others' authority on the one hand, while having others under our authority on the other hand
There are many young students who think that God is chastising them by requiring them to submit to their teachers
There are many wives who think that God is chastising them by requiring them to submit to a husband who is impossible to live under
Faith is the principle by which we receive life, while submission is the principle by which we conduct our living
In order to have the oneness of the Body, there must first be the life of the Head and then the authority of the Head
A servant of God will eventually encounter authority in the universe, in his community, in his home, or in the church
A worker of God must not only learn submission to authority; he must also learn to be God's deputy authority in the church and in the home
If God entrusts him with many things, and if he has learned to submit under God's authority, he will not feel boastful about anything
Some who have learned to submit to others find that they do not know how to be the authority when they are brought by God to a place to work
Not only do we have to learn to submit to authority, but we also have to learn to be the authority and to stand in the proper position
On the other hand, the church suffers because many do not know how to be the authority by standing in the proper position
They did not turn their faces toward their father's shame; instead, they covered their father with the garment on their shoulders
When Nadab and Abihu worked apart from Aaron, they were working apart from God, because God's work is a coordination in authority
In spiritual matters or spiritual works it is not an individual serving, but a corporate Body coordinating in serving
Even Aaron himself did not know that the matter was so serious, but Moses knew the solemnness of rebelling against God's authority
For this reason, the free-lance evangelists who were prevalent in China in the past were a great loss to the church
They speak against the responsible brothers in the church, but they do not realize the seriousness of this matter
If one day the church receives grace from God, she will separate herself from those who revile the servant of God
May God be merciful to us that we would see that this is not a matter with our brother, but a matter of God's appointed authority
Numbers 16 speaks of the company of Korah, who were Levites, and Dathan and Abiram, who were of the tribe of Reuben
When they rebuked Moses, they mentioned nothing about Moses' relationship with God or God's command in this matter
Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself?
They refused, saying, 'You have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards
Moses and Aaron fell down before God and prayed, 'Shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the assembly'?
Only those who are apparently blind, who probe forward by faith, ignoring the present desolation, can enter into Canaan
If a man sees only his father, brothers, or sisters, he does not know what authority is, and has not yet met God
In verses 1 through 40 we have the rebellion of the leaders, whereas in verses 41 through 50 we have the rebellion of the whole assembly
Moses could not consume people with fire; it was the fire that proceeded from Jehovah God that judged the people
Such people are very bold; they are not afraid even when they see judgment, because they do not have the knowledge of authority
When the whole assembly attacked Moses and Aaron, the glory of God appeared, proving that authority is from God
When the Israelites entered Canaan they asked God for a king, and God sent Samuel to anoint Saul as their first king
In refusing to kill the king of Amalek and the best of the sheep and oxen, he rebelled against God and disobeyed His words
If he had killed Saul, it would have been in the principle of rebellion against God's authority, because God's anointing was still upon Saul
Even if David set the whole kingdom in order, this would avail nothing without being under God's authority; he would still be like Saul
In the Old Testament Saul loved the best of the sheep and the oxen and would not destroy them, but rather saved them for offering
What we condemn is not just murder; even the cutting off of another's garment with a little knife is wrong and is rebellion
It is submission to the anointing upon the person, the anointing which was upon him when God set him up as authority
He said to the man, 'How is it that you were not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed'?
The Lord lowered Himself twice, first in emptying Himself in His deity, and then in humbling Himself in His humanity
In the Godhead there is equality, yet it is happily arranged that the Father should be the Head and that the Son should submit
When the Lord came down to earth, He dropped authority on the one hand and picked up submission on the other hand
It seems as if there was a conference in the Godhead in the beginning in which a plan was made to create the universe
If there was only authority without submission, authority could not be established, because authority is not something isolated
One day the Son willingly emptied Himself to become a created man as the representation of submission to authority
If He had not been submissive, He could have reclaimed the divine form of His deity only in His position as the Son
Whoever knows this principle will realize that no sin is uglier than rebellion and that nothing is more important than submission
When the Lord came to the earth, He did not bring obedience with Him; rather, He learned it through sufferings
He learned obedience through the sufferings He went through, and He became the cause of eternal salvation to all those who obey
Have you ever realized how much the universe was affected by the fall of the angels and man and how big a problem this made for God?
God desired that His creatures would accept His authority; however, both kinds of creatures rejected His authority
The Bible calls the kingdom of God the kingdom of the heavens because rebellion is not limited to just the world
The church today must also allow God's authority to have a free way and manifest His kingdom through submission
Because of the rebellious ones among them, God led them through the wilderness to teach them obedience before He would establish the kingdom
Even though the second generation entered, they were not yet fully obedient; they did not completely drive out the Canaanites
We do not find the first king after God's heart until David was chosen and became submissive to God's authority
It was God's command that Jerusalem be the place where His name should be set, but the people chose Gibeon and set up altars there
Revelation 12:10 says, 'Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ'
Because the Lord's life has been released to the church, His kingdom must also be propagated and established through the church
There must be an absolute submission and an absolute position for God so that His authority can be perfectly carried out
Not only does God want man to submit to His direct authority, He wants man to submit to all of His appointed, deputy authorities as well
Thessalonians 1:8 says, 'Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Peter 1:22 says, 'Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth ' By this we see that salvation comes through obedience
God has called us not only to receive life through faith, but also to maintain His authority through obedience
God's plan for us in the church is for us to submit to His authority and to all the authorities He has established
One day there will be a declaration, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ'
If the church will not give the kingdom of God a free way, the kingdom of God will have no way among the nations
Today if the church cannot submit to God because of a little difficulty, how can the kingdom of God be manifested?
God Himself has set up systems of authorities for His expression so that when man meets these authorities he will meet God Himself
When God was not present, man could remind himself of God's commandment, which was the prohibition concerning the eating of the fruit
If we understand God's authority as being only in Himself, it is very likely that we will offend God's authority more than half of the time
Even in the time of Moses, we can already see that the Israelites' resistance to authority was their resistance to God
When the Lord was on the earth, He likewise submitted to the government and to the authority of the high priest
Not only do we have to submit to our own nation and to our own race, we have to submit to the government wherever we are as well
For a Christian, abiding by the law is not something done out of fear of punishment but out of the exercise of his conscience before God
God establishes the husband as the deputy authority of Christ, and the wife as the representation of the church
Unless the wife sees the authority that the husband represents, the authority that God has set up, it is difficult for her to submit
Titus 2:5 says young women should be 'subject to their own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed'
In their attitude they should be in fear and trembling, not being deceitful or crafty, rendering only eye-service
You must first uphold the Lord's authority yourself, and then others will uphold the Lord's authority which is with you
When Paul and Peter said these words, they were still under the Roman Empire where slave trading was very prevalent
Whether or not the system of slavery is right is one thing, but God ordains that slaves should obey their masters
In verse 16 the apostle further said, 'You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring'
Not only has God set up His deputy authority in the universe, He has also set up His authority in the spiritual world
A Christian should have two kinds of feelings: one is the feeling of sin, and the other is the feeling of authority
It is much easier for us to be confident in submitting to representative authorities than for God to be confident in setting them up
Luke 9:48 says, 'Whoever receives this little child because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me'
In Luke 10:16 the Lord sent out the disciples and said, 'He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me'
He did not say that they should be careful in their words or that they should not blunder in speaking when they went out
If this is the case, you would probably require him to send back a daily report of his work, lest there be any mistake
In other words, whether the deputy authority is right or wrong is a matter for which he has to be responsible directly before the Lord
We have been talking about submission for five or ten years, but how much have we submitted to indirect authorities?
For the sake of clarity in explanation, we have differentiated between direct authority and indirect authority
Man's rebellious nature likes to submit to God's direct authority, but reject God's appointed deputy authority
When a woman was young in her father's house, her father had to silently acknowledge the vow before it would become effective
When a woman is under the authority of her husband, God will not uphold her vow as long as the husband disallows it
If the deputy authority is wrong God will deal with him he will have to bear the iniquity of his wife and the submitting wife is guiltless
God establishes through the establishment of the deputy authority, and He annuls through the annulling of the deputy authority
Only when the deputy authority obviously defies God's commandment and offends the Lord's person can we refuse the deputy authority
There is no way to tell whether a child's submission to his parents is from the heart or if it is merely superficial or behavioral
Many kinds of submission are based upon man's relationship with man-for example, a father with a son or a master with a servant
We think that the church is the gathering together of believers of the same faith, or that it is a gathering together in love
Father and son, master and servant, or even husband and wife can be separated, but the body and the head can never be separated
For this reason God has to establish a perfect authority and a perfect submission, which is Christ and the church, the Head and the Body
If you have submitted yourself to God often, you realize that God's command and God's will are entirely different
In the third part of God's work, God will make the kingdoms of the earth the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ
The place where His authority will see a complete success and the place where the tide is turned is the church
The oneness of the body with the head does not depend only on a conscious submission, but on an unconscious submission
Its harmony is beyond the description of human words, and its submission to authority is the most perfect that can be found
The church is not only the place of fellowship for the brothers and sisters; it is also the place for the manifestation of authority
No matter how far the members are from the head, their relationship with the head is the same, and all their works relate back to the head
Although the function of the hand is great, it has to accept the function of the foot in the matter of walking
For this reason everyone should stand in his position as a member, receiving the function of the other members
In today's situation, the eyes have seen, but the hand says that it has not seen and that it is waiting to see
Man wants to have everything and to be able to do everything; he does not want to receive the supply of the members
To receive others' function, which means to receive their authority, is to receive the riches of the whole Body
God cannot wait until we reach a certain stage or until a certain number of years have passed before He shows us something
Through their discernments becoming our discernments we can receive their riches without going through their sufferings
When we submit to the authority of the seeing function, we will have no barrier with the Head, because the supply is in the authority
For unbelievers and Israelites, submission is a difficult matter because they are not related to other unbelievers and Israelites in life
It is not a difficult matter to submit, for within we are all one, sharing the same life and the same Holy Spirit
The Lord has taught us not only to learn submission in the family and in the world, but also in the Body, in the church
In the Body of Christ, authority and submission meet in one Body, and both have become subjective, living, and united
Sooner or later rebellious words will come out of his mouth, because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
If a man speaks words of rebellion carelessly without any restraining within, he must be one who has never met authority
Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it'
In Numbers 16 when the company of Korah and the 250 leaders rebelled, the manifestation was all the more in words
Although Miriam reviled, she did so in a reserved way, and as such there was still the possibility of recovery
Those who have shaken off all restraints, who are completely unchecked, open the gates of Hades for themselves, and Hades swallows them up
We see that whoever listens only to God's direct authority, but refuses His deputy authority, is in the principle of rebellion
As an apostle and prophet he spoke in the position of a prophet to Ananias the high priest God is going to strike you you whitewashed wall
When he heard that Ananias was the high priest, he immediately softened and said, ''You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people''
Particular kinds of people live among those who are of their own kind; they have communication with their kind of people
The power of Satan is established upon lawlessness, while the angels are those that would not overstep their position
Peter used this as an example to show us that since the angels in the heavens are like this, we should be like that even more
If a man's lack of submission is in his heart only, without corresponding utterances from his mouth, his power will not be lost as fast
Today Christians lose their power through their mouth in no less measure than they lose it through their conduct
Once we meet authority, there will be a sense of authority in us, in the same way that there will be a sense of sin once we meet the Lord
From the time before we believed in the Lord even until now, the basic principle of our living has been in reasoning
There are two kinds of Christians: one living on the level of reason and the other living on the level of authority
God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion
Up to this point Paul anticipated that there would be more reasonings, such as, 'Why does He still find fault?
Paul also knew that they were quite reasonable and sensible, but he retorted, 'But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God?
The basic problem with man today is that he is still under the principle of the knowledge of good and evil, the principle of reasoning
Only when the Lord grants us a little light and reveals a little of His glory to us will we fall down as dead, just like the apostle John
When the queen of the south came to visit Solomon and he revealed a little of his glory to her, there was no more spirit left in her
If God would reveal just a little of His glory to us, we would see that we are but a dead dog and a lump of clay
Every time the Lord commanded the Israelites to do something in Leviticus 1822 He inserted the words I am Jehovah in between the commands
If we pulled God down to the level of reason, we would have God no longer, because He would be no different from us
Paul said that we have to overthrow the strongholds, the reasonings, and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God
A man refuses to believe in the Lord usually because of one or two reasons with which he surrounds himself as strongholds
Submission to Christ is possible only through the authority of God that captures the thoughts and makes them God's slaves
When Satan's stronghold is torn down, there is no more reason, and the thoughts are taken captive unto the obedience of Christ
To discern whether or not a man has met authority, we need to see if such a one has been dealt with in speaking, in reasons, and in opinions
When this is the case, it clearly shows that the thoughts are not captured and that there is no knowledge of authority
Saul had been an outstanding and distinguished person everywhere he went but when he met the authority of God all of his opinions were gone
Saul was rejected by God, not for theft but for offering a sacrifice to God of sheep and oxen that he assumed were the best
God commanded that all the Amalekites with their sheep and oxen be completely destroyed, but Saul was unwilling to do it
Although they did not say anything or murmur any reasonings, they burned incense by their own will and according to their own feeling
God does not check on our zeal for the gospel or our willingness to suffer; He checks to see whether or not we are obedient
Refraining from opinion stopping all reasonings ceasing all evil speaking and submitting to God completely are the beginning of the kingdom
If there is a church on earth that truly submits to God's authority, there will be the testimony of the kingdom, and Satan will be defeated
As long as we stand on the principle of rebellion and act independently by our own will, Satan will laugh in secret
The apostles, however, were not rebellious in their spirit; they were still submitting to all those who were in authority
At any rate, there must never be any attitude of stubbornness or words of contradiction against those in authority
When the deputy authority clashes with the direct authority , one must be submissive to the deputy authority but must not be obedient to it
If the deputy authority gives an order that is obviously contrary to God's order, we can only submit; we cannot obey
The midwives and the mother of Moses disobeyed the order of Pharaoh so that the life of Moses could be preserved
Daniel defied the decree in order to pray to God, yet he submitted to the king's judgment to be thrown into the lion's den
He will then come to know that the principle of lawlessness abounds everywhere, in the world as well as in the church
Only when the brothers and sisters are submissive to authority will the church have a testimony and a way on earth
Since we have seen the glory of Christ and the Body of Christ, we cannot have any other name apart from the name of the Lord
God has established deputy authorities in the church; the church is built up and maintained by the authority of God
If there is no testimony of submission among God's children, there will be no church, and there will be no ministry and no work
We must have a very serious dealing before the Lord, and must encounter the matter of authority in a thorough way
The only authority that is authority at all is the authority that comes from God, and only such authority can claim submission from others
All deputy authorities must remember that they are merely God's representative authorities; they have no authority in themselves
There is no intrinsic element in ourselves that sets us apart from others or that gives us the right to be an authority
One does not become an authority based on his own ideas or opinions, but through an apprehension of God's will and desire
They think that they have better ideas and opinions, and they assume to be the authority and impose themselves upon others
It is only when you become acquainted with God's will that you can ask others to submit to the authority in you
No one who does not learn to submit to God's authority or who is ignorant of His will can become God's deputy authority
Suppose you tell someone to do something, and suppose he has the chance to go to the Lord together with you to inquire of the matter
If God does not acknowledge what you have said to the brothers, you will be left representing only yourself, not God
God's deputy authority must not only know His authority on the positive side, but must learn to deny himself on the negative side
We are afraid of those with much opinion, and we are also afraid of those with many ideas, those who like to be others' counselors
As soon as they are given the chance, they open their mouth to express their ideas and air their opinions before others
Please remember that God would never appoint anyone with a great deal of opinions, proposals, and views to be His deputy authority
We would not ask a person who loves to spend money to manage our bank account, because we do not want to suffer loss
Such a one must first go through God's breaking and give up his interest in meddling in others' affairs and acting as others' counselors
It means that we must be genuinely broken our wisdom must be destroyed and our opinions and proposals must be crushed before God can use us
The basic problem with many people is that by nature they are active in their mind; they speak a great deal and make many proposals
As long as God's wound remains in a man, he will feel the pain the minute he moves, and no one will need to remind him of his wound
Such ones may pick up some teachings on brokenness and realize that they should not talk so much or make so many proposals
If they begin to imitate others and follow their example, their fig leaves soon will dry up , and their underlying condition will be exposed
God needs to inflict a wound on us so that as soon as we move again, we will feel the hurt and not dare make any more proposals
When a man is wounded, there is no need for others to exhort him to walk slowly; he spontaneously will slow his pace
Those who are the deputy authorities must learn not to propose any opinion of their own or express their own ideas
They may have experienced some minor and superficial dealings, but their opinions, ideas, and methods still abound
Every deputy authority of God must have one basic qualification-they must not have an inclination for careless opinions or criticism
Those who are God's deputy authorities should possess a third qualification-they must have a constant and intimate fellowship with the Lord
Every time one has an opinion, he has to bring it to the Lord and find out if such an opinion is of the flesh or of God
Only those who are near to God have a fear of Him, and only these ones can feel the repugnancy of wild opinions
Even though people here speak of the president freely, if he came to Kuling, everyone would address him as 'Sir' or 'Mr
If the things we were so sure of in the past can be found to be wrong today, what will happen to the things that we are so sure of today?
When we go before the Lord, there should be 'no more spirit' in us; we should not dare speak His name lightly or open our mouth rashly
May the Lord deliver us from the sickness of speaking what we do not understand and making judgments on what we do not know
Only those who have learned the lessons can know Gods will and only as they live in Gods presence can they speak to the brothers and sisters
The problem with many of God's servants today is that they are too bold, or to put it in a stronger way, they are too reckless
Only when we see something before God can we minister it to the brothers and sisters and only then are we qualified to be a deputy authority
Since God is the One who establishes authority, there is no need for deputy authorities to try to build up their own authority
If they do not want us to be their authority, or if they shy away from us, we do not have to force them to accept us
Many people think that they are growing spiritually, but unless they continue in obedience, God's light will stop
If they do not submit, they will fall back, and if they oppose you, they will not be able to go on spiritually
We have to realize that when others offend authority, they are not offending us, but the authority that is in us
We will pay attention to the description of his reaction when his authority was offended, mocked, opposed, and rejected
In one instance, his brother Aaron and his sister Miriam reviled him, criticized him, and rejected him as the deputy authority
Aaron and Miriam were in effect challenging Moses: 'Can it be possible that only you, Moses, who married a Cushite woman, can speak for God?
Is it possible that we who have never married a descendant of Ham are barred from being God's mouthpiece also'?
They might have argued a great deal with their sister-in-law, but the real problem was that they were touching Moses as the deputy authority
Those who find out what others say about them and then get angry, indignant, or vindictive are not qualified to be a deputy authority
Whenever we vindicate ourselves before those who criticize us, we are telling them that they are higher than us
There is a parenthetical word in verse 3: 'Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all the men who were on the face of the earth'
Numbers 12:4 says, 'And suddenly Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting'
Aaron and Miriam might have criticized Moses many times, but the Lord suddenly called them to the tent of meeting
They speak against others loosely because they are living in their own tent; they are far away from the tent of meeting
They first questioned if it was fair that God only spoke to Moses, and now God summoned them to hear His words too
After this God said, 'If there is a prophet among you ' , as if He did not know that there was a prophet among them
It is true that everyone who is sent in the name of the Lord to speak to God's children has some degree of authority
The establishment of authority is based upon God's choice; it is God's business, and man cannot interfere in any way
If God grants us revelation, and we have a clear word from Him and face-to-face fellowship with Him, no one can annul us
If the way upward is not clear and heaven is not open to us, nothing will avail even if all the doors on earth are open to us
You spoke against him because his wife may not have been a good sister-in-law in your house, but he is My servant
If they have any life in them at all, they will experience a closed heaven, and they will bow to you and acknowledge your authority
As soon as others touch you, God seals up their heaven, and they have no choice but to turn and repent, acknowledging you as God's authority
God did not say, 'You have spoken against Moses;' rather, He said that they had spoken against 'My servant, against Moses'
If it had been someone else, it would have been the same; it would have been 'My servant,' plus the name of the servant
We should pay attention to the condition of Moses that is his attitude and the way he dealt with the situation that is his answer to them
He seemed to say to Korah, 'It is not a small thing for the sons of Levi to be chosen by God to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah
If we allow others to continue in their mistakes, it means that our hearts are hardened and that we have no intention to recover them
In verse 12 he sent for Dathan and Abiram to come, but they would not come, indicating that they wanted to break away
It is also like the ten spies who clearly saw the riches of Canaan and yet would not enter, but murmured against Moses instead
Moses was sent by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, just as Christ was sent by God to impart eternal life to men
He did not pass his own sentence or make his own proposals, and he did not have a spirit of judgment within him
All the assembly of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, 'You have killed the people of Jehovah'
He told Aaron to come to him immediately, and he took Aaron's censer to the assembly and made propitiation for them
He knew the tragic end that the Israelites were going to face, and he realized that their loss would be God's loss
Aaron ran into the midst of the assembly and stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped
We must still bear the affairs of God's children on our shoulders, and we must not allow God's house to suffer loss
A deputy authority must not act according to his own feeling, and he must not care for himself or be a self-centered person
May the Lord make us gracious persons, those who can tolerate all of God's children and who can bear His children upon our shoulders
He wants His servants to seek after His grace inwardly while they are carrying out His righteousness outwardly
He wants all His servants, that is, those who are His deputy authorities, to have His heart and be full of grace as well
We have to learn to bless when we are reviled to intercede for others when we are rejected and to plead for forgiveness when we are offended
We should allow only God to execute His righteousness in all things, while we ourselves should be gracious to all men
Chapter sixteen speaks of man's rebellion against God's deputy authority and how man opposed God's appointed authority
By nature and according to their natural disposition, they were both sons of wrath; there was no difference between them
When Aaron served the Lord again with his authority, he would say to the Lord, 'My rod was as dead as others' rods
Aaron represented the tribe of Levi and was no different than the others in his representation of his own tribe
After God caused Aaron's rod to bud, blossom, and bear fruit, the tribes saw it, and they had nothing more to say
The problem today is that it is hard to find a person who will bow down and confess that he is the same as everyone else
What extreme self-confidence and foolishness would the colt have had if it assumed on that day that the praises were directed towards it!
If we want to serve the Lord today we must also realize that our service is based on resurrection and resurrection is based on God not on us
Resurrection is everything that is not out of our natural life, not out of ourselves, and not based on our ability
God testifies again and again to His people that authority to serve God lies in resurrection, not in a person himself
All those who think highly of themselves and who hold a misguided judgment of themselves have never realized what resurrection is
If a man continues to think that he is able, that he can do something, and that he is useful, he does not know resurrection
He may know the doctrine of resurrection, the reason for resurrection, or the result of resurrection, but he does not know resurrection
What we can do belongs to the natural realm, and what is impossible for us to do belongs to the realm of resurrection
After Sarah gave birth to Isaac, she would never be foolish enough to think that her own strength was responsible for it
When you have resurrection, you have authority, because authority rests with resurrection, not with the natural life
Following this he said that he was pressed on every side, but that he was not constricted because of the efficacy of the treasure
On the one hand, we have a constant deliverance to death, but on the other hand, we have the producing of life
Whenever we express the natural life, we become the same as everyone else, and there is no authority in us whatsoever
It is not just a faint expression of the resurrection life but a life that has budded, blossomed, and brought forth fruit
When they came into the wilderness of Zin, they were without water, and they murmured and spoke against Moses and Aaron
Verse 10 shows that Moses was very angry when he said, 'Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock'?
He might have thought, 'This rebellious people has been causing trouble for decades, and they are causing trouble still'
God's dealing with Moses and Aaron meant that this act was committed by Moses and Aaron only, and that God had no part in it
After following God for so many years, he misrepresented God by disobeying Him, striking the rock twice, and speaking rash words
If you fall into God's governmental hand, you may be forgiven at times, but you may not be forgiven at other times
In the church submission to authority is absolute, and fear and trembling on the part of the deputy authority should also be absolute
For this reason, there is no dispute in the matter of authority, for there is no dispute in the matter of ministry
His censer could make propitiation and stop the plague, while the censers of the other 250 leaders were cursed by God
Little do they realize that any authority which issues from a ministry never goes beyond its own service to rule over God's children
If a minister misrepresents authority, his ministry will stop, just as Moses' and Aaron's ministries were stopped
Neither one of them debated with God; they knew that God's vindication was more important than their entry into Canaan
We thank the Lord because here was a servant who knew how to judge himself and who allowed God to vindicate Himself
We need to pray, 'Lord, may Your authority be manifested in the church, and may every brother and sister know what authority is
A deputy authority of God must learn not to establish his own authority, but to build up the authority of those who are over him
After seven and a half years all the tribes of Israel came to Hebron and spoke to David saying Here we are we are your bone and your flesh
In the New Testament, when David is spoken of, he is addressed as 'David the king' , but Solomon is not addressed as a king
We should have not only the Lord's anointing but also the church's anointing before we assume authority among His children
David waited in Hebron for seven and a half years because Ishbosheth, Saul's son, continued to be king in Mahanaim after Saul's death
The minute a person rebels against authority he should be judged, whether or not he is rebelling against your authority
Samuel 6 says that when David brought God's ark back to the city of David, he danced before the ark with all his might
When David went before the Lord, he felt that he was as lowly as anyone else; he did not consider himself higher than others
She could not stand David's action, and said to him, 'How the king of Israel has made himself honorable today'!
Now that he had become king and his nation had become strong, he was meek enough to sit on the floor beside the ark
When a man is sent by the Lord, he may have a certain degree of authority in speaking and acting on God's behalf
God's deputy authority should have such a blessed ignorance-being an authority without having the consciousness of it
Zadok the high priest with all the priests and the Levites wanted to come with him, and they took the ark along with them
David said that if he should find favor in the sight of the Lord, He would bring him back again to see the ark and His habitation
In verse 27 David said to Zadok that since he was a priest and a seer, he should take the lead to bring the priests and the ark back
David still had his mighty men with him, and it would have been easy for him to get rid of this man, but he would not do this
He was God's appointed authority, but during his trial, he learned to humble himself under the mighty hand of God
In the Old Testament the greatest authority was Moses, while among all the kings the greatest authority was David
We know that the conversation was initiated by James and John; they wanted to sit on the right and left of the Lord in His glory
They thought that sitting on the right and the left was something that the Lord could grant or dispense to them
The Lord did not say that their request was wrong, nor did He say that it was wrong to desire to be at His right and left side
He told them that in order to be on His right and left, they had to drink of His cup and be baptized with His baptism
The Lord told them that it was not a matter of asking but a matter of drinking the cup and partaking of the baptism
If a man does not drink of the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he cannot be near Him nor can he have any authority
In order to be near the Lord and have authority in glory, they needed to drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism
The Lord was asking the disciples if they could yield to God's will in the same way that He yielded to God's will
If a man can say glibly that he obeys God's will, he probably has not seen the great significance of God's will
Up until a few hours before the cross, He was still not committed to the work of the cross; He was only committed to obedience to God's will
Those who have passed through this baptism are immediately separated from those who have not passed through it
Following this the Lord said He who loves his soullife loses it and he who hates his soullife in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
The work of redemption can be accomplished only by Christ our High Priest; no one else can participate in it or do anything about it
For a person to be baptized with the Lord's baptism means for him to be broken and torn down before the Lord and for life to come forth
Are you willing to bear the consequence of taking My baptism and becoming different from other children of God today'?
The Lord told them the fact, that to sit on His right and left required that they drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism
If a man does not drink the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he will surely not be able to sit on His right or left side
Even if he drinks His cup and is baptized with His baptism, he may still not be able to sit on His right or left side
Those who do not drink the Lord's cup and are not baptized with His baptism will surely not sit on His right or left
He said You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them
The Lord showed them that among the Gentiles, there are those who are esteemed as rulers and great ones who lord it over them
It is good if some among us seek for future glory, but such ones should not have the thought of lording it over God's children today
If we do not take this way yet try to reach our destination, or if we do not have the root yet try to produce fruit, we are trying in vain
We must abound in our knowledge of God's will and must accept all the breakings so that the life within can be released
Such a Gentile spirit must be thoroughly purged from us before we can go down from this mountain to help others or handle business affairs
In God's house we can only take the spiritual way according to the spiritual principle; we cannot take the way of politicians
In verses 42 and 43 the Lord said that the Gentiles have rulers and great men to rule over them, but 'it is not so among you'
Those who are great in the church, that is, those who are established by the Lord as great ones, are actually the servants and slaves of all
Whoever wants to become great shall be the servant of all, and whoever wants to be the first shall be the slave of all
There is the need to drink the cupobedience to Gods will absolutelyand to accept the baptismacknowledgment of death for the release of life
All those who are willing to be servants will be appointed by the Lord as the great ones, and they will be entrusted with authority
If you do not possess the first point-a spiritual foundation, it will do you no good to possess the second-humility
After the first qualification there is the need for the second condition which is being a servant and a slave among the brothers and sisters
Those who fulfill these two conditions who see themselves as unsuitable and incapable men are the ones who are qualified to be the authority
In order to be a deputy authority, we must fulfill the condition of spirituality as well as the condition of humility
We may have tended sheep or plowed the field but when we come in from the field we should still acknowledge that we are unprofitable slaves
Finally the Lord said, 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many'
The less ambition a man has and the more he humbles himself before the Lord, the more useful he is in the eyes of the Lord
The more a man thinks highly of himself and the more he thinks he is different from others, the less he is useful in the hand of the Lord
It is too great a matter, something unfathomable to man, and something that we dare not touch with our own hands
Please remember that authority is based on attainment on the one hand and on humility and obedience before God on the other hand
It means that the Lord refrained from doing many things, which were legitimate for Him to do, for the sake of the disciples
While He was on the earth, He had much more liberty than we have, and He could have done many more things than we
In order for us to learn to be an authority, we must also learn to set ourselves apart from the brothers and sisters
In acting as a member, he should coordinate and serve together with others, not setting himself apart as a special class
Aaron had four sons, who served as priests in the sanctuary; they were anointed the same day that he was anointed
The judgment that a servant of God can suffer is different from the judgment that an ordinary Israelite can suffer
It is understandable and legitimate for a father to mourn over his son or for a person to mourn over his own brother
The Israelites did not have to live in the tabernacle at all, yet Aaron and his sons could not even leave the door of the tabernacle
The world and other brothers and sisters may maintain their family affections, but a deputy authority is set apart to maintain God's glory
According to Leviticus 109 God told Aaron Do not drink wine or strong drink you or your sons with you when you come into the tent of meeting
Many who are familiar with the Bible think that these two offered up strange fire after becoming drunk with wine
The high priest is bound by a higher requirement: He cannot touch a dead body, not even when it is his father or mother
The more we are sanctified and the more we are restricted by God and bound under His authority, the more we can be an authority
Although there is such a thing as authority in the family, those who are in authority should fulfill God's requirements
They cannot say that since their children have been begotten and are being raised up by them, they can treat them at will
If a deputy authority only knows to threaten and judge others, he will come under God's judgment sooner or later
A man who is over others should not try to uphold his own standing; instead, he should do his utmost to uphold righteousness
Managing one's house does not refer to managing one's parents or wife, but it refers mainly to managing one's children
If an elder is always conscious of his authority, he is not qualified to be an elder or to handle the affairs of the church
If we are the same as others in many things, and if we are loose, careless, and unchecked in our daily life, others will despise us
Although a worker should not seek after human glory or honor, he should neither be despised to the point of losing his sanctified stature
In these two books Paul often said that a worker should not dishonor himself but should be a pattern in everything
The main thing about a representative authority is that he represents God, and being an authority has everything to do with being a pattern
Even if the husband voids both the vow and the oath of the wife she has to submit and it is not reckoned to her as a sin if she breaks them
We can find no clearer picture of man's requirement to submit to deputy authority in the Bible than in Numbers 30
In the same way, there is no clearer picture of the serious responsibility that an authority bears before God than in Numbers 30
The more proposals a deputy authority makes, the more trouble he is asking for himself, and the more he will invite God's judgment
We have to live in the Body life, to fellowship with the Lord, and to fellowship with the brothers and sisters
The more we present our decision to the church and the more we fellowship with the members, the more assurance we will have
