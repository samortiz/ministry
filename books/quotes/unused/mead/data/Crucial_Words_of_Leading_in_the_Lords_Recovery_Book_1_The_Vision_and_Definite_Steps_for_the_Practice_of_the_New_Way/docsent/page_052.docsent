   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING AN AGGRESSIVE, BOLD, AND DARING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that we will have the boldness and the confidence to open our mouth to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not be afraid, and we must not be shy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such are not the attitudes of one who is serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What I mean is that when we go to a home meeting, we should fire up the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not be afraid if the meeting does not have fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not worry when instead it pours cold water on our head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must have a strong determination that anytime we go to a meeting, we must light a fire in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are shy and hesitating, we will only quench the fire, even quenching it quicker than any other person will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will not be able to fire up anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are all young people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we want to work, we must work with enthusiasm and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be like Elijah, who called fire down from heaven even when the ground was covered with water 1 Kings 18:33-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need this kind of attitude, this kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Twenty-three years ago I went alone to America as a sixty-year-old Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not have any theological qualifications, and I never studied in America.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the first time I worked in America.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I had to learn their language in order to preach to the Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time I encountered cold water everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All around me was chilling ice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet I did not care for any of these frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I had the confidence within that as long as I was selling treasure, someone would buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end, the water was dried up by the fire; everywhere I saw churches being raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Chinese went to Brazil thirty years ago, the easiest way for them to make money was to carry a knapsack on their back and sell their wares from their sack.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Chinese who had just migrated to Brazil had very little else they could do because they could not understand Portuguese.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time a favorite item for the Brazilians was embroidery work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the only kind of business the Chinese knew to do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They would wrap all kinds of Chinese goods inside a sheet and carry it on their backs, going from house to house to make sales.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Brazilians are very hospitable people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever they saw someone coming to their door with a knapsack, they would open the door and invite the person to come in for tea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Chinese may not have known the language, but they surely could communicate with their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After unwrapping their sack and settling on the price, they would make their sale.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes they were able to sell their goods in this way by the hundreds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In time, they could communicate in the native language and were able to make even more sales.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today in working for the Lord, we should be like those who carried their goods on their back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not matter if we cannot communicate very well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we can open up our sack and show people our goods, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not matter if we are not able to make ourselves clear; we should simply repeat the same words a few more times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the goods.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have this spirit and this attitude, surely we will be able to sell our goods.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we go to the home meetings with the same spirit, I guarantee that every home will be fired up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if it was dead before, we can do what Elisha did; he laid mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and palm to palm, stretching himself over the one who was dead and dispensed life to him 2 Kings 4:32-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At most, we need to do this for two or three weeks; then the people will come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must believe that the eternal and incorruptible life is within all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we work aggressively enough, they will come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe that we can all testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times some co-workers asked me, Brother Lee, what is the secret of your work?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can say that the secret of my work is that I do not know what difficulty is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know only to give myself to work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not care for the result; I care only to labor diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can say that my secret is simply to work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not care about the circumstances; I care only to work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The result of this work during the past sixty years can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as we work, there will be the result.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thirty-seven years ago, the situation in mainland China changed suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time all the co-workers gathered together in Shanghai to prepare for the change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Nee said specifically in that co-workers meeting that I should leave the country.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, I was the only one who left; all the rest stayed behind for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, Shanghai was the largest city in all of Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church in Shanghai was the leading church among more than four hundred churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every week we published one periodical.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of this work was under my care.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We even spent one hundred five thousand dollars U.S. to buy a piece of land and were prepared to build a three-thousand-seat meeting hall that would also accommodate two thousand people outside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then suddenly I was sent to the small island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I first arrived in Taiwan, I did not know where I should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The brothers in Taipei invited me to speak on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I went to the meeting place, I found out that it was a run-down house that occupied only a few square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As I entered the door, I had to take off my shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I was from north China; according to our custom it is impolite to take off one s shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I had never taken off my shoes in public, but on that day I had to speak without my shoes on.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I was afraid that I would not be able to deliver my message and that my spirit would be gone, but I went against my will and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There were only a few dozen people sitting around in a scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I groaned within.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I returned to my dwelling, which was a small place with only two rooms, I fell on my bed and stared at the ceiling.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I asked myself, What am I doing here in Taiwan?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As I looked at the pebbled streets outside the window and listened to the sound of the wooden clogs clattering on the road, I wondered what kind of work I could do there.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I did not understand the native Taiwanese dialect, and everything around me was disappointing and discouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, since I was already in Taiwan, I reasoned, What can I say?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Chinese have a saying that when the goods arrive at the doorstep, the deal is done.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since I had already moved my goods to Taiwan, I had to sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If I did not sell my goods, they would spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After two months a thought came to me, and I believe that it was of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I asked myself, Why don t you take a trip along the railway route?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>At that time there were a few hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan who had just moved from mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They were scattered in the few major cities along the railway route.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>So I took the train and visited Shin-ju, Taichung, Zhia-yi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That visit gave me a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I felt that much could be done.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I returned, I fellowshipped with the brothers, and we decided to begin the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe the senior co-workers among us remember that at the beginning of our work in Taiwan the first meeting hall in Taipei was only one-half the size of what it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The land was donated by two overseas Chinese brothers, and we erected a temporary canopy with wooden beams for our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once we began our work, God s blessing was there.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We decided to preach the gospel, but the meeting place was not large enough.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The land across the street from the hall was an unassigned plot, and nothing was on it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We decided to contract some people to enclose it with bamboo fences, bricks, and wooden props.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It provided a temporary overflow space for meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>That space later became the Workers Home.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This was how we began our work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should not allow any circumstance to quench our burden for the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We work even if the worst hardship befalls us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We work even if harsh poverty meets us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As long as we are clear that we are serving the Lord, we should charge forward without any fear.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not think that if we are rejected, we will have no more places to go.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do not say that it is impossible to have a home meeting that has only one believer because the rest of the household worships idols.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is to pour cold water on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is to quench the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we do that, it is no wonder that we cannot bring life into the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>No matter how difficult the situation is, as long as we have the Lord s presence, we can go against all odds.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>One characteristic of a Christian is that he can go against the tide and move forward by beholding the Lord s face.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When the missionaries came to China, they also faced trying situations.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Everywhere they went, they faced opposition and cold water.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Rocks were thrown at them, and some were even martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Yet they were not discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>They pressed on and did not turn back for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Eventually, they opened the door of the gospel in that old, conservative land.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Today to spread the Lord s gospel in Taiwan and to evangelize the whole island, we need the spirit and perseverance of the missionaries who went before us.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we sit here hoping that evangelization will come, that is a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we wait until all things are ready, and if we think that we can preach the gospel from an easy chair, we will never see anything of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel, He told them not to bring any shoes, staff, or money.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This means they needed to have the attitude that if there was no food, they would simply press on in hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If there were no shoes, they would simply move on bare feet.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we have such a spirit, the gospel will surely prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Dr. Mateer, the chairman of the translation team that put out the Chinese Union Version, was one of the seven renowned scholars in the East Pacific region.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When he came to China, he lived in a carpenter s home in Penglai in Shangtung province in north China.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The father of one of our senior co-workers was a student of his in oceanography.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When Dr. Mateer first came to China, he and his companions could not find a place to live.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>No one was willing to rent, much less sell, a room to him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>In the end, some among them had to live on the streets, and some were forced to take shelter in idol temples.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>This was how they persevered in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I say this to show that we are not qualified to do the Lord s work if our intention is to wait for all things to be ready before we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we want to be in the Lord s work, we must learn to strive even when there is nothing for us to work with.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In short, we should not be deterred by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Rather, we should charge forward with no thought of turning back.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We must not allow anything to cripple our aspiration to build up the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We must have the will to do or die.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I hope that the co-workers, the elders, and all the full-timers will pick up this burden and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The home meetings are not a product of our imagination but they come from the Lord s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>As long as we are willing to work, something will be worked out in a proper way.</S>
