<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from our depths, that You have gathered us once again into Your name. Lord, we believe You are with us, that Your Spirit is here, and that Your word is opened up to us. Lord, we thank You that in this dark age, we have Your bright holy word in our hands, as a lamp that shines in a dark place. We fully believe that You will release Yourself from Your word tonight. Lord, we want to be fully open to You. May Your Spirit move freely in this meeting. Lord, fill us all, and transfuse Your desire and Your word into us and into our mouth. May our speaking be Your speaking, and may You speak in our speaking. Lord, deliver us from wasted and idle words, so that we can speak purely about You, about Your glory, Your person, what You are, and what You have done, and may all of us gain something from You. Lord, cover all of us with Your victorious blood. Oppose for us all the powers of darkness. May glory be to You and blessing be to the saints. Amen.<p>During the last ten years, from 1980 until now, the Lord’s leading among us has gradually opened up to us in one specific direction the mysteries in the Bible. This direction is the divine economy. With this divine economy, there is a divine dispensing. The word “economy” was used especially by Paul in his Epistles (Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Cor. 9:17; 1 Tim. 1:4). The word means a plan, an arrangement, and a purpose. God’s economy, plan, arrangement, and purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, and redeemed people. When we repent and believe in the Lord, God redeems, justifies, and regenerates us. This first step of regeneration, by which God enters into our spirit, is the beginning of God’s dispensing into us. Hence, regeneration is the beginning of the divine dispensing of the divine economy. Through this dispensing, the complete God is dispensed into millions of people. He is in you and at the same time is in me. He is in all of those who have believed in the Lord. Throughout the ages, millions of believers have had this same God within them. He has dispensed Himself to us, yet He Himself is not divided. He is complete in every one of us who has believed. This One is complete, yet He is distributed to everyone, and everyone has a part in Him.<p>This is like a house that has been completed, whose power lines have been installed. When it is connected to the power source, electricity comes. From that time on, the electricity stored in the power station is continually distributed into the house, and all the electric appliances are able to function. The operation of all the appliances depends on the distribution of the power station. Once the electricity stops, everything loses its function. Today, in this universe, there is a tremendous thing. Our God is like electricity. One day He installed Himself from the heavenly power station into us, the believers. During the past ten years, among us the Lord has shown us continually that God has a mysterious economy, which is to dispense Himself as a complete Being into every one of us. When we call on the name of the Lord, believe, and are baptized, God is transmitted into us. The Triune God has dispensed Himself into us. Within us, such a wonderful dispensing has taken place.<p>In the previous messages, we have seen God’s dispensing from the Gospel of John and from the book of Romans respectively. Later, we will consider God’s dispensing from the book of Ephesians. Now we will consider God’s dispensing from 1 and 2 Corinthians.
