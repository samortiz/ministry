   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING HELP FROM GOD AND NOT FROM MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not be indebted to others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should receive our help from God, not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The past one hundred years of Christian work here has not built up the church; instead, it has damaged and torn down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Western missionaries need to learn the lesson of helping people before the Lord without making them their beneficiaries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People should feel that they have received their help from God, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not edifying for the Western brothers to give people the feeling of being their beneficiaries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By so doing, they make themselves superior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will never build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we help in secret, our help will benefit others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT CONSIDERING OTHERS SUPERIOR</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND OURSELVES INFERIOR</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Western brothers had good intentions, but they needed to consider their way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their way was inappropriate because it did not edify.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the brothers were associated with them for a long time, considering that everything from the West was good and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We never thought that we should help them in this aspect because we considered ourselves to be inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not think too highly of ourselves, and we should not consider ourselves inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do need the supply from the West in many areas, but this does not mean that everything from the West is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This depends on our ability to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have received help from the Western brothers, but they also need to receive help from us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be humble and receive help from them, but this does not mean that everything they have is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We criticize them because we hope that we can all learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the elders decide to study a particular book of the Bible, they would not insist on another book if they were experienced in spiritual matters and in their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These brothers were competent in their medical field, but in administrating the church and in touching spiritual matters, they were infants learning to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether we can supply the need of the church does not depend on which book of the Bible we study.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can supply the spiritual need of the saints through any book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These brothers were not responsible ones in the church, but they gave the saints a negative impression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before they rendered a supply, they adjusted others; before their capability was manifested, they criticized others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates a lack of learning in spiritual matters and an inability to get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a lack damages the building work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need to learn to know people and discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are learning to serve the Lord, we must be able to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not think that everything from the West is good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have invited Western brothers with great expectations, but the result of their visit causes us to be fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On their side, their conduct was inappropriate; on our side, we did not know how to express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We received many Western meals, but the Western brothers refused to receive Chinese meals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is necessary to discern matters for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we always appreciate the things of the West and despise the things of the East, the church will never be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is not only the Lord of the Jews; He is also the Lord of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, the Lord is the Lord of the Westerners and of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not give light only to the West.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, while we should not be proud, we should not feel inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should study whether a matter is right or wrong and whether it is helpful or not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not think that everything from the West is good and therefore should be received.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we should learn to know people and discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we are building the Lord s church, we must learn to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not treat anything lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should carefully consider and evaluate the matters that involve us and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should consider the source of a matter and its consequences before making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every doctor must carefully consider the medication that should be given to a patient.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot be rash and careless or crude and coarse; rather, we must always be careful and cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to spend time before the Lord to carefully consider how to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since we are building up the church, we must learn to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This applies to the administration of the church, the ministry of the word, and our contact with others.</S>
