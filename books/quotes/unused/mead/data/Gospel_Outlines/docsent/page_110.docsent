   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To prove that men have all sinned, pick up two or three important sins, such as telling lies, stealing, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men are all under the condemnation Since all men have sinned, they are all condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because God is righteous, He cannot reckon those that have sinned as without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men are also condemned in their own conscience.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His saving way is to lay all of our sins on His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus did not die on the cross as a martyr, but rather, to be our substitute to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the blood that the Lord Jesus shed on the cross is able to cleanse us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He that believeth is not condemned What to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Firstly, believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and came to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Secondly, believe that the Lord Jesus bore our sins on the cross, shed His precious blood, and then rose up from the dead to be our Savior.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s judgment has passed over him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore his conscience will not condemn him any more.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word condemned here in the original text also means judged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He that believeth not is condemned already Since all men are sinful, they are condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God had the Lord Jesus bear our sins, if we do not believe in Him, we would naturally remain under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore all those who do not believe are condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They can only wait for the eternal judgment and perdition.</S>
