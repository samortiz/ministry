Chapters six and seven contain messages given in Kuching concerning the coming of Christ and the consummation of the age
The Lord's Spirit is with us all the time and everywhere, but when we meet together, the Lord's Spirit is doubly present with us
We were alike in that we were born in Christianity, we grew up in Christianity, and we were educated in Christianity
It was an unstable time the country was segmented by the warlords, the government was corrupt, and the people were suffering
Seeing the international situation and considering the future of the country, many young people really desired to do something
At that time the Lord did a particular work in China and raised up a number of young people who loved the Lord and who lived for the Lord
We determined to have only three things the Bible, the Lord's name, and salvation; the rest we could do without
The more we regularly experience the spiritual things, the richer we become, yet there is no spectacular sensation
After hearing the gospel and believing and receiving the Lord, they had to successfully pass through an interview concerning baptism
After you experience the morning revival and the daily overcoming, you will receive the burden to preach the gospel
You can make a list of the names of twenty of your relatives, colleagues, classmates, and neighbors, and pray for them
You may also bring them to the group meetings to give them the opportunity to contact others and listen to testimonies
After their baptism, you should give them a lesson to show them that today the Lord is the Spirit dwelling in them
You need to teach them how to exercise their spirit to call on the Lord's name at any time and to pray to Jesus in everything
After you continue to do this for two or three months, he will become a remaining fruit, one who remains in the church life
To labor is to not be lazy but to be industrious; it includes striving, expending great effort, and endeavoring to go on by struggling
We know that all New Testament believers are priests, but five years ago we did not point out what the New Testament priests do
In Deuteronomy 33:8-9 God blessed Levi through Moses, saying, 'May Your Thummim and Urim be with Your godly man
In the sixteenth century Martin Luther rose up to make reforms as a result the Protestant churches came into being from the Catholic Church
Later, we discovered that in a considerable number of areas we had not entered deeply enough into the biblical truths
Unconsciously we fell into a condition in which there was a lack; that is, our inner life was not sufficiently fresh and living
All the churches, in both the east and in the west, were in a dormant state, in a condition like that of Sardis
These gifted persons need to perfect the saints and then the saints will be able to do what the gifted persons do and will properly function
The sacrifices offered by the New Testament priests are absolutely different from the sacrifices offered by the Old Testament priests
We should beseech the believers through the compassions of God that they may offer themselves as a living sacrifice to God
Since every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel everyone needs to preach the gospel to offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God
In the past six years, we were continually experimenting and trying out various ways, and did not have a definite way of practice
The people on the list will serve as the objects for the saints to contact in their preaching of the gospel in mutual coordination
If every church has fifty priests of the gospel who go out to contact the acquaintances of all the saints, the gospel will spread
In this way all the individual fellowships will add up to a very good message; this will render help to the attendants
For the practice of the new way, first we must be revived every morning, and then we must have an overcoming daily life
After this, to serve as a reminder, we may jot down the points concerning which the Lord inspired us with when we were with Him
We should not only do this ourselves, but we should also perfect others to do this so that more saints will be able to function
The meetings will surely be fresh, rich, and full of supply, not only attractive to people but also able to build them up
Not long after this, you will be able to see that he is growing in the Lord and has changed; thus, he will have become stable
In the group meeting, the main thing is to do the work of perfecting; it is best to spend half the time to do this work
God did not annul the individual worship, but the individual worship is not the goal that God desires to obtain
From the time of Moses, this kind of worship continued for fifteen or sixteen hundred years among the children of Israel
At his conception, it was spoken concerning him that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
He was born into a priestly family; his father Zachariah was a priest who took the lead in his course of priestly service
He put on a garment of camel's hair and wore a leather girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey
He altogether abandoned God's Old Testament dispensation, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture
Christianity preaches Christ, but it has deviated in its preaching of Christ, having only the name of Christ but not the reality
If we compare this with the condition in today's Catholicism or Protestantism, we know that it is altogether different
Although we say that we are in the Lord's recovery, a good part of what we have, we inherited from Catholicism and Protestantism
A principle with all of these inherited ways is that they require only a few people and do not require everyone to function
Fairly speaking, up to the present, the gospel preaching among us has not gone back to the way taught in the Bible
For this reason, the Lord also wants us to feed His lambs , to nourish the regenerated believers with the riches of the Lord's life
To do this requires us first to set aside a definite time every week to visit our acquaintances to bring God's salvation to them
The Bible requires us to perfect the saints that they may do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ
In the group meetings the saints can understand one another, and if there is any problem or need they can pray for one another
We have found a very good way that is to take one of the books of the Bible as a line and prayread two or three verses every day in sequence
When we come to the group meetings, we have more than ten verses that we can bring out for mutual sharing and for discussing together
We are not rich in content; especially in these four things we are weak and are not strong enough, and we are old and not fresh enough
According to the entire world situation, it seems that the Lord is quickly doing this very thing; He is speeding up His recovery
Two or three may take the lead to do these things, then gradually there may be five or six, then eight or nine, and so on
The New Testament service ordained by God in the Scriptures indicates that all New Testament believers are priests to serve God
Everyone who serves God, anywhere and at any time, must be a priest whose special profession is to serve full time before God
Although he serves full time, he still labors for his livelihood, working with his own hands to minister to his own needs
Almost everywhere in the entire New Testament, God speaks concerning how to be priests of the gospel of God, how to serve God
By this we can see that the priests of the gospel, mentioned in Romans 15:16, are those who specialize in taking care of the gospel
According to the New Testament, there are at least seven aspects related to being priests of the gospel of God
We know that today any kind of successful work in human society must be a work that is carried out by an organized group
It is difficult for individuals to have a great success; the achieving of a great success depends on the effort of an organized group
When we preach the gospel in the church today, we also should realize that the whole church constitutes a priesthood of the gospel
Today in the church, we, the priests of the gospel, should be built up together to serve in coordination as a body of priests
If we preach the gospel without any building up, but in a very individualistic way, our gospel will never be powerful or effective
For the preaching of the gospel to be both powerful and effective, we must be built up together and coordinated together
We should learn to be upright and not crooked, to obey the Lord, and to be built up with others into a holy priesthood
The priesthood of the gospel should tell out the virtues of the One who has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light
According to my observation, the number of baptized ones among us is not small; there are many baptized ones everywhere
In order that we may be the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must have a living that matches our priesthood
Books such as the Gospel of John, Romans, Galatians, and Philippians are very good material for morning revival
As the priests of the gospel of God, we need not only to be revived every morning but also to overcome every day
Although Paul encountered many problems in his experience, he could always give thanks to God because he had found the secret
To be revived every morning and to overcome every day has become our motto in all the churches around the globe today
What we spoke previously concerns the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, which is also what we call begetting
The Lord came to perform a miracle, enabling them to catch a net full of fish, and He also prepared breakfast for them
Chapter fifteen says that we should bear remaining fruit, and chapter twenty-one says that we need to feed the lambs
Every one of us should not only preach the gospel to save sinners, but also should have two or three lambs in our hands
The third step is to perfect the saints, that is, to teach them , which is usually carried out through the group meetings
Everyone simply lives together and spontaneously there is fellowship intercession knowing the need of one another and care for one another
For this reason, we need to entreat and console the believers and to testify to them as a father to his own children
In this message we will cover the fourth step of being a priest of the New Testament, that is, prophesying for God
In the New Testament, there is one chapter, 1 Corinthians 14, that is altogether concerned with the matter of prophesying
Whichever way we may render it, both prophesying and predicting are not to speak for ourselves but to speak for God
When we prophesy for God, we speak for God, speak forth God, and speak God into people to dispense God to them
He said, 'Greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up'
Corinthians 14:12 says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church'
Corinthians 14:23-25 shows us if all prophesy in the church meetings, this will cause people to be convicted and to be brought back to God
If in a meeting you stand up to prophesy for God, you feel that that meeting is good; otherwise, you may not feel that it is good
Whether a meeting is good or not does not depend on the meeting itself, but on whether or not you prophesy for God
Under the grace of the New Testament, God does not want to do things by Himself; He wants man to cooperate with Him
When you have a morning revival every day in this way, you will surely have some inspiration which you may jot down
In addition, when you prophesy, avoid wordiness or common words; instead, speak God's word and speak concise words
At that time, when you come together, you will be able to speak for God; you will be able to speak to the point and speak with substance
If in a meeting twenty people can prophesy in this way, no individual preaching can compare with their speaking
After some practice, gradually the proper condition will be manifested and the improper condition will disappear
We receive the inspiration in our daily life, and then we can present it in the meetings for the building up of the church
When we speak concerning Christ's coming, we cannot avoid speaking concerning the consummation of the present age
If we want to understand Christ's coming back, we must have a clear understanding concerning the last seven years of the present age
, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, conquered Jerusalem and carried away all the children of Israel as captives, among whom was Daniel
Although today we come from different places and speak with different accents, we have the same Christ dwelling in us to make us one
Christ will slay Antichrist by the breath of His mouth and bring Antichrist to nothing by the manifestation of His coming
Matthew 24:3 says, 'And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us,
Revelation 13:1 points out that a beast, which signifies Antichrist, will come up out of the Mediterranean Sea
He will have the support of ten kings, and they will unite to form a great empire, which will be the revived Roman Empire
In the previous two years we all have seen the great change in the world situation, a change that is beyond our imagination
The entire situation in Europe is pushing toward the direction prophesied in the Bible for the restoration of the Roman Empire
In Matthew 21:19, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus cursed a fig tree because He could not find any fruit on it
The Bible contains a prophecy saying that one day the cursed and dried up fig tree would become tender and put forth leaves
The Holy Land belonged altogether to the Arabs, and the site of the temple had been occupied for seven centuries
After another nineteen years, in 1967, during the six-day war, Israel seized Jerusalem; that was the fig tree 'putting forth leaves'
The last week will be cut into two halves by Antichrist's abolishing of the seven-year covenant he will make with Israel
It will be 'the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth'
At that time God will judge the entire universe with supernatural calamities, so that the earth will not be suitable for man's existence
He will make a seven-year covenant with the children of Israel, and that will be the beginning of the last week
Neither should we become slothful, thinking that, since the Lord is delaying His coming, we can eat and drink and become drunken
The crucial question today is this: Do we want to bury ourselves in the world or put ourselves in the Lord's hand?
We should know that once we bury ourselves in the world and become rooted in it, it will not be easy to be uprooted
In the period before the Reformation, the Catholic Church paid little attention to the second coming of Christ
All the Christian leaders assembled together and formulated the Nicene Creed, which temporarily settled all their arguments
Under the rule of the Catholic Church, the church passed through a period called the Dark Ages for ten centuries
In 1517 Martin Luther took the lead to reform the church, and he translated the Bible into German, thus opening up the biblical truths
They were enlightened by the Lord concerning the truth, and there was a great advancement in the knowledge of the Bible
The logic in his line of thought was somewhat deficient, and the details regarding the Lord's second coming were not made sufficiently clear
If we trace the history in the Old Testament, we see that God raised up Gentile powers to chastise Israel because of Israel's rebellion
From the book of Isaiah we can see that Cyrus, the king of Persia, was God's beloved, and he even became a type of Christ
Cyrus defeated Babylon and, under God's inspiration, released the children of Israel that they might go back to rebuild the temple
When he invaded Jerusalem, the high priest Jaddua went to meet him and showed him the portion in Daniel concerning the he-goat
After the storm calmed down, she withdrew from the mission and received the burden from the Lord to come back to China
Antichrist will be resuscitated after being slain, but Hitler's body was not even intact for burial after his death
Before the great tribulation, the man-child will be caught up to the presence of Christ in the heavens where the throne of God is
The firstfruit also will be raptured to the presence of Christ in the heavens, where the heavenly Mount Zion is
During that period of time, there will be numerous supernatural calamities, and Antichrist will do all he can to cruelly oppress the saints
There Christ will tread the great winepress of God's wrath , and the blood will reach to the bridles of the horses
He will sit on His throne of glory to judge the nations who are living at that time and separate them from one another
That will be the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel , and it will usher in the restoration of all things
He reminded Timothy, and also us, by the Lord's judgment and kingdom that we should have a living that loves the Lord's appearing
Because she loved and treasured the evil world which God was going to judge and utterly destroy, she took a backward look
