Brother Nee boarded the steamer for Shanghai yesterday (the tenth) at noon. While Brother Nee was in Hong Kong, he was busy editing The Normal Christian Church Life. He also held edification meetings on three Lord's Days in which he was responsible for all the speaking. Praise and thank the Lord, his speaking really helped many of the brothers and sisters. Brother Chu Wen-yao and his four brothers came to Kowloon yesterday. The Lord's marvelous grace preserved them safely all the way. Brother Lin Hung-en and his wife sent a letter yesterday saying that they had arrived safely in Manila on the twenty-eighth of last month and met with Sister Chai Teh-an and the others. I heard that Brother Simon Meek has already gone to the outlying islands to give conferences and has not yet returned to Manila. After Miss Tso and Miss Miao arrived in Shanghai, they both sent letters to me. Although they met with some storms on this voyage, they arrived in Shanghai on schedule, thank the Lord. Brother Witness Lee wrote a letter on December 31 saying that Chefoo is quiet and the meetings are continuing as usual. He has not yet gone out into the countryside. Brother Chao Jing-hwai and the others are still doing business in Chefoo. Brother Chao Bi-chen is now in Ping-Yin County of Shantung province. He is staying at the home of Brother Kao Lien-deng and others in Nan- Kung Village. Brother Chou Kang-yao and Sister Bi-Hsia and the others sent a letter from K'un-ming, Yunnan, saying that they are all safe. Sister Bi-Hsia is now helping some in a hospital and taking this opportunity to preach the gospel. Brother Mu Hue-chen came from Kaifeng to Hong Kong. He is waiting for the steamer to go to Wu-Chow. He is still working at the Salt Ministry. Senior Mr. and Mrs. Nee are doing very well. The others here and I have been preserved by the Lord and are healthy. Yesterday, we started to have a sisters' conference every morning at ten o'clock in Kowloon. Sister Yu Shu-jen is responsible for the preaching. I have heard that the circumstances are very good. The conference will last for a week or ten days. Please pray for it. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip<br />January 11</p><p>P.S. Tze-hsien adds a note of greeting. Jing-wai writes a greeting.</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Stephen Kaung,<br />Hong Kong</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved in the Lord, X:</p><p>Peace to you! I received your letter. Mr. Nee spent three Lord's Days here and began his return journey to Shanghai on the tenth of this month. He plans to print The Normal Christian Church Life in Shanghai. Mr. Luan's health has improved because the climate is good and he is also resting. I feel that the work in Hong Kong lacks spiritual weight. Please pray for this. I really hope that the brothers and sisters can have a closer touch with God. As far as number is concerned, there are so many people in the Lord's Day preaching meeting that the place we have rented is not big enough. There are very few local brothers. Miss Miao and Miss Tso returned to Shanghai ahead of the rest and sent a letter saying that they arrived safely. Miss Yu and Miss Lee are still here. Miss Yu held a week-long conference and is now continuing for another week. Brother Chu Wen-yao and his brothers arrived on the tenth of the month. They have not decided what they will do in the future. Miss Shen Hwei-min has also come. Brother Mu Hue-chen has arrived in Hong Kong and will leave shortly for Wu-Chow where he will assume his position in the Salt Ministry. Miss Chang Ping-ching, Miss Chang Tze-ping, and Miss Luh (from Amoy) of Kweilin have met each other and started a prayer meeting. The meetings in Canton are down to one session on the Lord's Day for the breaking of bread and for the exhorting of one another. On the particular Lord's Day that I went to Canton, more than ten brothers and sisters came to the table meeting. All the brothers and sisters in Taishan are well. Perhaps there will be an assembly soon in Macao because Brother Nee Hwai-tzu, Brother Chang Shi-wu, and Brother Liu Tien-an (from Foochow) are all there. Mrs. Faithful Luk will move to Southeast Asia soon. Brother Chen Ju-yen will also move to Southeast Asia shortly. Mr. Luk's most recent letter said, "Sitiawan has sent me several letters, and Penang has also sent me telegrams. I really cannot respond to their requests. I can only beg the Lord to send out workers. We have already rented a youth meeting hall here in Singapore four times a month on the Lord's Day from two to six o'clock for fifteen dollars a month." Please greet Miss Chang and Miss Wang for me and also greet Brother Yu-zhi. Please give my best to Mrs. Yuan. Peace in the Lord! Brother Chen Ju-yen sends his greetings.</p><p>A bondslave of the Lord, Stephen<br />January 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
