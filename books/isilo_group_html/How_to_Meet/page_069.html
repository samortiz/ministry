<p>Then we come to the third section, the praise to the King about His children. Verse 16: &ldquo;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&rdquo; On one hand we are the daughters and we are the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Christ. In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes. Then all the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, &ldquo;O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 17: &ldquo;I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.&rdquo; How could Christ be on earth with all the people praising Him forever and ever? Through the princes, through His children, through us. To satisfy Him we are the virgins, the kings&rsquo; daughters. To rule for Him we are the princes.</p>
<p>I believe that this Psalm, Psalm 45, is the richest Psalm concerning Christ. No human mind could compose such a Psalm; it is far beyond human mentality. In such a short Psalm of only seventeen verses, how many points, how many aspects, how many items there are, all from which we may compose our praises to Christ. How much we have with which to bubble over! May the Lord bring us more deeply into all these things, and may we exercise our spirit to compose and use our tongue as a pen to write praises touching Christ, the church, and all the saints.</p>
<p class="hbody">Our hearts are overflowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak a goodly thing&mdash;<br />
To tell what we&rsquo;ve experienced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our exalted King.<br />
Our tongues as pens are ready,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve volumes here to &ldquo;write&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
The glories of our Bridegroom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lord and our delight.</p>
<p class="hbody">Lord Jesus, Thou art fairer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than all the sons of men;<br />
Thy goodness is transcendent&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah! Amen!<br />
Upon Thy lips most holy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abundant grace is poured;<br />
Forever God has blessed Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gracious, glorious Lord!</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art the mighty warrior<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rides to victory;<br />
In Thy majestic glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride on triumphantly!<br />
The peoples fall beneath Thee&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conquering One Thou art.<br />
Thine arrows in their sharpness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have entered Satan&rsquo;s heart!</p>
<p class="hbody">Thy throne, O God, forever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever shall endure;<br />
The scepter of Thy kingdom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the earth is sure.<br />
&rsquo;Tis with the oil of gladness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has anointed Thee<br />
Above all Thy companions&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How worthy there to be!</p>
<p class="hbody">Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all Thy garments smell:<br />
Thy death and resurrection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all Thy deeds forthtell.<br />
Out of the local churches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall praises make Thee glad,<br />
And praises upon praises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy joyful saints shall add.</p>
<p class="hbody">The queen in gold of Ophir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Thy right hand doth stand;<br />
Kings&rsquo; daughters are the women<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fill Thy honored band.<br />
The church in all her glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall match her glorious King,<br />
And all the saints, the women,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy likeness there shall bring.</p>
<p class="hbody">O daughter, now consider,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&rsquo;en now incline thine ear:<br />
Remember not thy people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all thine own things here.<br />
Thy beauty then shall blossom&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill be the King&rsquo;s desire;<br />
For He thy worthy Lord is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy worship to inspire.</p>
<p class="hbody">The daughter&rsquo;s glorious garments<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are made of inwrought gold&mdash;<br />
Within the inner palace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How wondrous to behold!<br />
The glory of God&rsquo;s nature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is given her to wear,<br />
That all His holy being<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may in life declare.</p>
<p class="hbody">In clothing too embroidered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;ll to the King be led,<br />
In that fine linen garment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be exhibited.<br />
&rsquo;Tis by the Spirit&rsquo;s stitching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Christ in us is wrought,<br />
And with this glorious garment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll to the King be brought.</p>
<p class="hbody">What gladness and rejoicing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we the King shall see!<br />
We&rsquo;ll shout His worthy praises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all eternity.<br />
And though the King we worship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or glory in the Queen,<br />
In all this blest enjoyment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory goes to Him.</p>
