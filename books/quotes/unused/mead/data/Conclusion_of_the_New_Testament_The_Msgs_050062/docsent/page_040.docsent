   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Rock</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's building there is the need for a rock, and this rock is Christ Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the New Testament, God's building is built absolutely on this rock, which is the Rock of Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This rock is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 and as the consummation of the Triune God after the steps of His process.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the rock for the building of God's house is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Living Stone</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is also the stone, the living stone, for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Peter 2:4 speaks of Christ as a living stone: "To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is Christ for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As life to us, Christ is the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For God's building, He is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way He makes us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature so that we may be built together with others a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone Isa 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Christ and through Christ we also become living stones to be built up a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ, through regeneration and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were created of clay Rom 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At Peter's conversion the Lord gave him a new name Peter, a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was also the rock Matt 16:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter realized by these two incidents that both Christ and His believers are stones for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In actuality we become stones through the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this process our natural life is replaced by Christ, and Christ becomes us, thereby making us the precious materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we are undergoing the process of transformation so that Christ, the living stone, may be constituted into us to make us living stones for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spiritual house into which we are being built is God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are becoming the precious stones that will be built up into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This process takes place as we daily contact Christ, the living stone for God's building, and are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Foundation</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God's building Christ is the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ" 1 Cor 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can lay any other foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing and no one can compare with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing and no one, other than He, are qualified to be the foundation of the divine building in the universe according to God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the unique One to be the unique foundation of this divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Cornerstone</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 2:20 says that in God's building Christ is the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse Christ is referred to as the cornerstone, not as the foundation, because the main concern here is the cornerstone that joins the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:7 , which joins the Gentiles to them for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many unbelieving Jews reject the Lord Jesus because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But as soon as a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined in Christ for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is crucial for us to see that God's building in the New Testament age is altogether with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this building Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why we should learn to minister nothing other than Christ to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For God's building we need Christ as everything to us.</S>
