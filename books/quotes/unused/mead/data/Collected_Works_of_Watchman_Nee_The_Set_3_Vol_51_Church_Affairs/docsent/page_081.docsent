   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Situation in Those Days Being Different</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do we see here?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We see that Paul was sent by the Holy Spirit to go out from Antioch and travel to various places to work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a great difference between the situation today and the situation in those days in the matter of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In those days, if the brothers in Antioch had some money and material things to give to Paul, they could not go to the post office to remit the money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither was there a bank, express air mail, or telegrams.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament there are quite a few cases in which gifts were sent in person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul himself did this when he was in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first time he went out was not for gospel preaching but to carry money to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I often think that our doing such things could be uplifted first you send money and later you go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first time he carried money to Jerusalem as an ambassador of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, when Paul received gifts, they were carried to him by people sent from various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You see how difficult it was without letters, telegrams, and airplanes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All those who went out for the gospel took nothing from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The apostle Paul was different from the apostles in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To go out from Jerusalem did not take long, and the journey was short.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One could return in a short time and have no financial difficulty because he could take sufficient money for the trip to Samaria and Caesarea and return after a period of time without needing to take anything from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was easy because both Caesarea and Samaria were localities with churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, Paul's work started from Antioch, and God gave him another way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way was for him to go to the Gentiles, yet take nothing from the Gentiles, and continue to go out, not returning in a short period of time like the apostles in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He kept going from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we can see that the matter of support was very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One could not take enough money along, and neither could one take anything from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is also different from the gospel preaching in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Gospels one went to the cities and lived in the house of a generous man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One did not need to bring his staff or his purse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when the Lord was about to depart from the earth, He told His disciples that he who did not have a staff needed to bring a staff, he who had no purse should prepare a purse, and he who had no clothes needed to prepare clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The situation had become different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel was not to be preached to Jews but to Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John made it very clear that we should take nothing from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we can see how heavy the burden on Paul was at that time, not only for himself, but also for the brothers who were together with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they started out from Antioch, there was only Barnabas and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, when they went out, there were others who went with them, one of whom was Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the way Timothy was added, Luke was added, and later Silas was also added.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As they went, the company became larger, and the further they went, the more the number of people increased.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, Priscilla and Aquila also came along.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They preached the gospel along the way in locality after locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Paul said that he worked with his own hands to supply his own needs and the needs of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me tell you, this was not a matter of occupation; his occupation was apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when there was the need along the way, he personally worked with his own hands to provide the support for himself and for those who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was a very good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Alford tells us that in those days, in order to make a tent, you needed to use a certain dye to color the tent material.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The dye was very strong, and the color did not easily fade.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a hand was corroded by the dye, the skin would be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Paul could tell the Ephesians to behold his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was a very great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I hope the brothers could see the financial problem of the apostles: If various churches can send support, thank God; but if various churches cannot send support, it does not mean that we should take other occupations or change our occupation as apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our occupation is as apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But I may make tents today in order to have this occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, in order that I and the brothers with me can be apostles, I may make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Making tents was not Paul's occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul's occupation never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From the time he was called in Damascus, his occupation never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order that the young men who were with him could have a supply, he made tents.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because he knew how, Paul made tents with his own hands when Timothy, Titus, Silas, and Luke were with him, to supply their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Behold, these two hands!</S>
