<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. IN ASKING GOD TO DEAL WITH HIS ENEMIES</H2><P>In Psalm 35 David asked God to deal with his enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Begging God to Fight<br>His Enemies with Weapons</H2><P>First, he begged God to fight his enemies with weapons (vv. 1-8). Verse 1 says, "Strive, O Jehovah, with those who strive with me;/Battle against those who battle against me." Do you believe that God desires such a prayer? This is not according to the Lord's teaching in the New Testament, which tells us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us (Matt. 5:44).</P><P>Verses 2-3 say, "Take hold of shield and buckler,/And rise up as my help./Draw out also the spear, and close up the way/Against those who pursue me;/Say to my soul,/I am your salvation." Instead of asking God for something, David here is teaching God how to deliver him by fighting against his enemies with weapons.</P><P>Verses 4-8 say, "Let those who seek my life/Be put to shame and humiliated;/Let those who devise evil for me/Be turned back and confounded./Let them be like chaff before the wind,/With the angel of Jehovah driving them on./Let their way be darkness and slipperiness itself,/With the angel of Jehovah pursuing them./For without cause they hid their net for me in a pit;/Without cause they dug a hole for me./Let destruction come upon them unawares,/And let his net, which he hid, catch him;/Let him fall into it, into destruction." Is this a spiritual prayer? Surely this prayer comes out of a man who is fully in himself. In the New Testament economy, a spiritual person could never ask God to come with a shield, with a buckler, and with a spear to fight against his enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Boasting in His Trusting in God<br>and in His Well-dealing with<br>Those Who Mistreated Him</H2><P>In verses 9-16 David boasted in his trusting in God and in his well-dealing with those who mistreated him. These verses say, "Then my soul will exult in Jehovah;/It will rejoice in His salvation./All my bones will say,/Jehovah, who is like You,/Who delivers an afflicted one from him who is too strong for him,/And an afflicted and needy one from him who robs him?/Malicious witnesses rise up;/They ask me about things I know nothing of./They repay me evil for good;/I am bereaved in soul./But I, when they were sick,/Had sackcloth as my clothing;/I afflicted my soul with fasting,/And my prayer returned to my own bosom./I conducted myself as if it had been my friend or my brother; /Like one mourning for his mother, I bowed down gloomily./But at my stumbling they rejoice and gather together;/The dregs whom I had not known/Gather together against me; /They tear at me and do not cease./As profane mocking parasites,/They gnash their teeth at me."</P><P>The above verses show that in David's consideration his enemies were very bad, whereas he was very good. His expressions in these verses display too much self-righteousness.</P>
