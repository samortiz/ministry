   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE LAW OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer's mind has reached the point of being renewed, he will marvel at the capability of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is now severed from dull and insignificant activities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer's concentration is more intensified, his understanding sharper, his memory stronger, his reasoning more precise, his eyesight farther, his work speedier, and his thoughts broader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He can more easily understand the thoughts of others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is less bound by his own little experiences, and he is more aware of the unlimitedness of spiritual knowledge and the need to have an open mind to accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the biases, prejudices, and opinions about the works of God are purged completely.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of mind can do the work that one usually cannot do and is able to bear two to three times more responsibility than what one can usually bear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, the believer's mind is not useful because it has not reached the stage of renewal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this does not mean that once his mind is renewed, there is no possibility of his being clamped down by the old mind anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a believer does not continuously resist old concepts, he will unconsciously think according to his old way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as a believer ought to walk according to the spirit daily and reject the behavior of the flesh, he should think according to the renewed mind daily and reject the old way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchfulness is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, a believer will go back to his former position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In spiritual matters, regression is something very real.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even after a believer's mind has been renewed, if he is not watchful, the possibility of believing in the evil spirits' lies and passively giving place to them still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a believer desires to keep his mind in a renewed condition and have his mind renewed day after day, he has no alternative but to know the law of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the spirit has its law which we have seen before , the mind also has its law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we will mention a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a believer practices these things, he will be victorious all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE MIND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we analyze the process of the walk of a spiritual believer, it may be divided into the following steps: the Holy Spirit reveals and makes known the will of God to the spirit of a believer; the believer realizes the meaning of this revelation through his mind and then exercises the power of his spirit through the will to move his body to execute this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the believer's living, nothing has a closer relationship with the spirit than the mind because the mind is the faculty that knows the things in the mental and material realm, and the spirit is the faculty that knows the things in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A believer knows all the things of himself through the mind, but it is through his spirit that he knows the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because both the spirit and the mind are the faculties of "knowledge," their relationship is closer than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our life of walking according to the spirit, the mind is the best assistant of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want to walk completely according to the spirit, we must know how these two assist each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible tells us clearly about the work of mutual assistance and reliance that exists between the mind and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In walking after the spirit, the cooperation between the spirit and the mind is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know" Eph 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two verses reveal the full relationship between the spirit and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we have mentioned before, "a spirit of wisdom and revelation" means that God has revealed and made known Himself and His will to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we have to pay attention to how the revelation received through the intuition of the spirit goes along with our mind.</S>
