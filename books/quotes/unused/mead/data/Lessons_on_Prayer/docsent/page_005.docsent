   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYER IS MAN BREATHING GOD, OBTAINING GOD, AND BEING OBTAINED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A real prayer is also man breathing in God just as he breathes in air.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While you are thus breathing in God, spontaneously you are obtaining God, just as when you breathe in air you receive air.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, not only is God obtained by you and becomes your enjoyment, but also your whole being surrenders to God, turns unto God, and is wholly gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more you pray, the more you will be filled with God, and the more you will surrender yourself to God and be gained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not pray for a week or, even worse, a month, then you will be quite far from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does it mean to be quite far from God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means that you cannot obtain God and be obtained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only remedy for this situation is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And it is not enough to pray for only two or three minutes; you must pray again and again until you have actually breathed God and are actually obtained by God, and God by you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, real prayer is of great importance to a Christian's spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, never think that prayer is merely asking God for something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, you need a house and you ask God to prepare one for you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After praying, you receive a word from the Lord saying that what you have asked shall come to pass unto you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The next day a brother comes and says to you, "Do you need a house?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My neighbor has two houses for rent; the location is convenient and the rent is cheap."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So, you immediately thank and praise the Lord, saying, "Hallelujah, the Lord is really the true and living God; He has answered my prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would not say that this is not prayer, but this is not adequate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, if you have really learned the lesson of prayer, whether you can find a house is actually secondary; the primary thing you should be concerned about is whether you have obtained more of God and whether you have been gained more by God through such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the result of a prayer is only the accomplishment of a particular matter, without obtaining God or being obtained by God, then such a prayer is a failure, a miscarriage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ultimate result of a prayer should be that the intercessor gains more of God and is gained more by God, though the thing which he has asked of God may also be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please consider, are your experiences of prayer like this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although many times we may not know such a meaning of prayer and may still pray to God concerning certain affairs, God still brings us into Himself through our prayers for those matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, a sister who is a mother loves her child dearly but loves the Lord very little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless how much you help her, she would not seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, one day her child becomes ill.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After numerous visits to physicians, the child remains sick.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She becomes helpless and has no alternative other than to put her trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When she comes to pray, she only asks the Lord to heal her child.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She does not have the slightest intention of seeking the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who would imagine that through such a prayer she would be able to actually meet Him, touch Him, and enjoy Him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of such a prayer, this one, who for many years refused to be gained by the Lord, has spontaneously entered into God and, at the same time, has been gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But still she does not understand what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After three days her child is actually healed, so she comes to the fellowship meeting and testifies how faithful God is, how He has answered her prayer, and how her child has been healed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although she has obtained the reality in prayer, she still does not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times we are just like that ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we see the desolation of the church and go to the Lord to pray, we feel that we are praying for the church's condition, but in God's view the purpose of our prayer is to cause us to touch Him, inhale Him, obtain Him, and allow Him to obtain us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe in the remaining years God will cause every one of His children to become more and more clear that real prayer is not to pray concerning affairs, ask for things, or intercede for people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Real prayer is to inhale God Himself, to obtain God, and to be obtained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those prayers for people, affairs, and things that are outside God are not the essence of prayer but are merely the outer skin or accessories of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A real prayer, a prayer of essence, is one in which you actually contact God, breathe Him, enjoy Him, obtain Him, are filled with Him, and allow Him to gain your being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the children of God can see this point they will have a better understanding of the real meaning of prayer.</S>
