   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TYPES OF THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament there are two types: one is the tabernacle, and the other is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people can speak on the tabernacle; there are at least one hundred books on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But it is difficult to find a book on the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men pay attention to the type of the tabernacle but neglect the type of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that the tabernacle and the temple are more or less the same thing, and that they are repetitive types.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the two types are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tabernacle was something temporary and on the periphery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The temple was something eternal and in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tabernacle was in the wilderness, and the temple was built by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tabernacle in the wilderness typifies the condition of the church on earth, and the temple in the kingdom typifies the eternal condition of the church before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we see this light, we will be very clear concerning today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God had obtained a tabernacle in Exodus already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This tabernacle followed the Israelites wherever they went.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later the tabernacle settled in Shiloh Josh 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the children of Israel stumbled and sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They had no king among them, and everyone acted according to that which was right in his own eyes Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, the Philistines came and were the enemies of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Samuel, Saul, and David were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two sons of Eli sinned, and the Israelites were defeated before the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The people tried to use the ark to protect them in battle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ark was the ark of the testimony, which was also the ark of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Israelites thought that the ark could help them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, God did not help them, and the ark left the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was captured and moved into the house of Dagon 1 Sam 4:1 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God did not try to protect the Israelites for the sake of the ark, nor did He need the Israelites themselves to protect the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the ark left the tabernacle, it never went back to it again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It remained outside the tabernacle until Solomon finished the temple, when it was moved into the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jeremiah 7:12 says that men were still going to Shiloh at the time of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the ark left the tabernacle, God left the tabernacle as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and was facing the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the condition of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time of Solomon, the king went to Gibeon to offer up sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Solomon prayed for wisdom in Gibeon, and his wisdom was unmatched by anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible says that Solomon went up and offered a thousand burnt offerings 1 Kings 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Chronicles 1 tells us that there was still the brazen altar, and there were priests at Gibeon vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the ark was no longer inside the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and had turned toward the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is also our way today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our way is the way of following the ark; it is not toward Gibeon, but toward the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today God is preparing all kinds of gold, silver, wood, stones, brass, and iron.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the time comes, Solomon will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On that day, no one will hear the sound of any work, because all the materials will have been prepared 1 Kings 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once Solomon came, the temple was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The materials for Solomon's temple were not cut on the spot; they were prepared ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although there are noises today, everything will be coordinated in that day, and there will be the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The desolation of the church is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the testimony of the temple throughout the past two thousand years has never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One truth after another has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These are not small recoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although there are all kinds of noises today, all the materials are being prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a fulfillment of the type of the building of the temple, the church of God is advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Presently, the materials are being prepared one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time there will no longer be any need for last-minute work; all that will be needed will be for the materials to be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The temple is not built on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, it is prefabricated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's work today is the perfecting of the Body of Christ for the arriving at the oneness of the faith Eph 4:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This has been God's work throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His works today are more numerous and more advanced than His works in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus said that the Father works until this day, and He works also John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As time goes on the Lord's work becomes better and better, and the content of it becomes richer and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we take the way of recovery, we will surely see God's work among us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sister Pearl Wang prayed: May Your word not be distorted through man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May Your word not be locked up by man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we not frustrate Your work, and may we not limit Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead, may Your work have a free way among us.</S>
