   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Corrected by the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your human concept distracts you from the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever you are distracted like this, you need the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After you have arrived at the wrong place, you need the right book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the magi had gone to Jerusalem, the wrong place, they were corrected through the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the Scriptures they learned that the right place was Bethlehem, not Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they had not been misled by their natural concept, the star certainly would have led them directly to the place where Jesus was in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But they were distracted and went astray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they needed to be corrected by the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the magi had been corrected by the Scriptures, had departed from Jerusalem, and had been restored to the right track, the star appeared again v. 9 . Living vision always goes along with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, none of the religious people in Jerusalem went with the magi to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is quite strange.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I had been there, I certainly would have gone to find out for myself whether or not Christ had actually been born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But none of them went.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although they were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living Person of the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How about today's situation?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Jewish religionists had cared for Christ, they would have gone to Bethlehem, which was not far from Jerusalem even by the ancient method of travel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Bethlehem was not far, none of the scribes, elders, or priests bothered to go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that you can have the knowledge of the Bible without having a heart for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To have the vision is one thing, to have the knowledge of the Bible is another thing, and to have a heart for the living Christ is still another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all need to pray, "Lord, give me a heart for You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4 Led Again by the Star to Find and Worship Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the magi saw the star again, the star led them to the place where Christ was vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The star led them not only to the city of Bethlehem, but to the exact spot where Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians often say that to know the Lord it is sufficient to have only the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a sense, I agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, in another sense I say this carefully I do not agree fully.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we have the Bible, we still need a living vision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that place, the star stopped v. 9 . The magi did not need to knock on any doors; they knew where Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This proves that we all need a clear, up-to-date vision that leads us directly to the place where Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The magi not only found Christ; they also worshipped Him v. 11 . Among the Israelites, no one was allowed to receive worship from others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was considered an insult to God, a blasphemy against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to them, only God was worthy of people's worship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the wise men worshipped a child, and that child was God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Isaiah 9:6 says, "Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The child found by the magi was called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The wise men worshipped Him and they offered to Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh Matt 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to know the meaning of the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the typology of the Bible, gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that the child Jesus had the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Frankincense signifies the fragrance of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to our naturally religious mentality, the resurrection of Jesus came only after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, before He died, Jesus told Mary and Martha that He was the resurrection and the life John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, even before He died, He was the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The life Christ lived on this earth was a life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Luke 2:52 tells us that even in His childhood He found favor with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was not something natural; it was the life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The record in Luke 2 reveals that the child was an extraordinary child.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was a unique child because He was a child in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In His entire human life and living there was the fragrance, the sweetness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Death could not hold Him or even touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only was He the life He was resurrection.</S>
