   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JUDGING SODOM AND GOMORRAH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The negative side of God's history during the life of Abraham was God's judging of Sodom and Gomorrah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The positive side was God's motivating, stirring up, and initiating the divine things in Abraham's life, which is a sign of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the negative side, God judged Sodom and Gomorrah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He burned Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Plain with brimstone and fire Gen 19:24-25 because of their grievous sin Gen 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of Abraham God sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow Gen 19:29, 12-22 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Lot and his family were fleeing, Lot's wife became a pillar of salt by looking back Gen 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her lingering look back at Sodom indicated that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was going to judge and utterly destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can see that Abraham suffered from two sources from his wife Sarah and from his nephew Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 13 Abraham had to solve the problem with Lot over the shortage of land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in Genesis 14 Abraham had to fight for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, by the time of Genesis 18 and 19, Lot had entered into Sodom, the center of sin, which was condemned and judged by fire from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lot escaped from God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah to the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But his two daughters made him drunk and committed incest with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children they had by this incest were Moab and Ammon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Moabites and Ammonites were rejected by God even to their tenth generation Deut 23:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This record of Lot should be a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through our fellowship in this message, we can see that Abraham is a sign of the life of God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is a sign of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all are the descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is our forefather and a sign to us.</S>
