<h2 class=head4>(7) They Are Blessed by Being Reproached in the Name of Christ, Because the Spirit of Glory and of God Rests upon Them</h2><p>First Peter 4:14 says, “If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.” “In the name of Christ” is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15) and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).<p>The reason the persecutions we suffer are the sufferings of Christ is that we suffer in the name of Christ. According to Peter’s word, we are blessed if we are reproached in the name of Christ. Do not think that it is a curse to be reproached in the name of Christ. On the contrary, this is to be blessed.<p>If we are reproached in the name of Christ, “the Spirit of glory and of God” rests upon us. Literally, the Greek says in 1 Peter 4:14 “the Spirit of glory and that of God.” The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the one through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 8:11). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more glory there will be upon us. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us.<h2 class=head4>(8) They Rejoice That They Are Counted Worthy to Be Dishonored on Behalf of the Name of Jesus</h2><p>When the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity, they can rejoice that they are counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus. In chapter five of Acts, the apostles were beaten and charged not to speak in the name of Jesus (v. 40). “They went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name” (v. 41). To be dishonored on behalf of the Name is to suffer shame for the Name. It is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the Name, the very name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus. Hence, the sufferers rejoiced that they were counted worthy of this.<h2 class=head4>(9) They Boast in Tribulations</h2><p>Through the experience of the divine dispensing the believers can also “boast in tribulations” (Rom. 5:3). The Greek word rendered “boast” also has the meaning of exult and glory; thus, we may boast, exult, glory, in tribulations.<p>Because our natural being needs to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed, God brings in certain tribulations and sufferings for our good. This is clearly revealed in Romans 8:28 and 29, where we are told that God causes all things to work together for good that we may be conformed to the image of His Son. Hence, tribulation and suffering are for our transformation.<p>We may appreciate peace, grace, and glory but not tribulation. Tribulation is actually the incarnation of grace with all the riches of Christ. This is similar to the incarnation of God in Jesus. Apparently He was simply the man Jesus; actually He was God. Apparently our environment is tribulation; actually it is grace. If we read Romans 5 carefully, we shall see that tribulation does not stand on the same level as grace, for it is under grace. In reality tribulation is a visitation of grace. This means that to reject tribulation is to reject grace. Tribulation is the incarnation of grace visiting us. Grace—God as our portion for our enjoyment—often visits us in the form of tribulation. If we realize this and experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we shall boast in tribulations.
