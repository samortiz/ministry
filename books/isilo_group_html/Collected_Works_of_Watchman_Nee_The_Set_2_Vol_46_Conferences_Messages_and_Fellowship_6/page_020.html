First, there is "bone." Adam's bone was the basis of Eve's life. Eve was built from his bone. Nothing was said of Adam's blood, because there was no propitiation in view, and there was no need of propitiation because there was no sin then to deal with. Adam was put to sleep so that Eve could be brought into being, and this sleep speaks of death apart from sin. Second, there is the "flesh." Man cannot eat "bone," but he can eat "flesh." "Flesh" is how we partake of Christ for the sustenance of the divine life which has been given us. The "flesh" is eaten for life, the blood is for propitiation. From the divine point of view, we have the "bone" for the building up of the Body of Christ. From the human point of view we have the "flesh" for the building up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 5:26 says, "That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word." What does water refer to? We should return to Paul's illustration. Adam's side, from which Eve was taken, is typical of the Lord's side which was pierced and from which flowed both blood and water. The blood speaks of the propitiating aspect of Christ's death, whereas the water speaks of the non-propitiating aspect of Christ's death. The blood is for God and has sin in view. But even when our sin matter is settled before God, we still need the water of the word for our continual purification. The blood does not cleanse our heart. The "I" cannot be cleansed; it must be removed. God does this by giving us a new heart. The blood cleanses our conscience because it puts things right before God; therefore, our conscience is at rest. "When I see the blood, I will pass over" (Exo. 12:13). The blood was on the outside for God to see; it was not for the believer, who was on the inside. The water stands for the non-propitiating death of Christ, and life is released by this death, which has nothing to do with sin.</p><p>Since man's fall Satan has had a double hold on man through sin and self. Our sins are the ground of his accusations, whereas our flesh is the ground of his activity in us. Since the blood has settled the whole matter of sin before God, it is the answer to every accusation of the enemy. The blood overcomes Satan because it enables God to stand justly on our side. Objectively, the blood delivers us from the power of Satan by removing all ground of his accusations; subjectively, the cross delivers us from the power of Satan by dealing with the flesh. The flesh is the ground of his working in us, just as our sins are the ground of his accusations of us. (Even God has to justify Satan's use of our flesh, for it bears his nature; it represents our fallen nature, and this nature has fallen over to him.) The blood propitiates; the cross does not propitiate. The blood deals with sin; the cross deals with us. The blood does not cleanse the flesh, which cannot be cleansed and must be done away with. The blood speaks of substitution; it speaks of His death for us. The cross speaks of identification; it speaks of our death with Him.</p><p>We are identified with Him not only in death, but also in resurrection. We must realize the importance of resurrection. When Christ passed into Hades, all the powers of hell were there to hinder His resurrection. Satan's greatest power is death; beyond this he has no power. In resurrection Christ passed beyond the touch of the satanic forces. Satan has no power over us only as we are in union with Him in resurrection. The natural life in us can always be touched, but not the resurrection life. A person, however patient by nature, always succumbs to the adversary's temptation to impatience, whereas one who by nature is very impatient can go patiently through any test if he relies upon the imparted patience of Christ. A healthy person, who could stand anything in the ordinary course of activity, will be physically drained if Satan assails him. But the weakest person who depends upon Christ's resurrection life for his body can go through any test without physical breakdown, because Satan cannot touch the resurrection life in him.</p><p>Christ by death destroyed him who has the might of death. But this triumph over the enemy, which has been established in Christ in His resurrection and exaltation and has been judicially accomplished on behalf of the church, has to be wrought into the church in the power of His resurrection life. Christ has dealt with Satan judicially, but He is waiting until all His enemies are made His footstool (Heb. 10:13), and this has to be accomplished by the church. The Lord has bruised Satan's head; his doom is sealed. However, the fact that he is a defeated foe has to be fully demonstrated in and by the church. Christ has already won the victory, but the fact of His victory must be manifested in the church.</p><p>The church has a definite responsibility before God. First and foremost, it is saving souls. Yet it is not to save them from hell, but to save them for the glory of God. The King must have people for His kingdom, and the increase of people means the increase of His glory. Second, the church bears the responsibility to register the victory of Christ in the devil's territory.</p><p>Why do we seek victory? Why do we seek enduement? It is so that we can be fully equipped for the cooperation with God in the outworking of His eternal purpose. Victory and enduement are precious items, but we must not lose sight of our great objective. It has pleased God to limit Himself to human cooperation for the accomplishment of His end. Christ has done everything potentially, but the accomplishment of His finished work has been committed to the church. We have been entrusted with the task of casting down God's enemy from the heavenlies!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
