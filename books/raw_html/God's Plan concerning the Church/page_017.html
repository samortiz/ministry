<h1 class="title">TALKS CONCERNING<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN INACCURATE CONCEPT</h2>
<p><em>Question: By paying attention to the ground of the church, are we making Christ a small Christ, a local Christ, and are we making the church only a small church, only a local church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: By paying attention to the ground of the church, we are not making Christ a small Christ, a local Christ, nor are we making the church only a small church, only a local church. Within the denominations, even in the Catholic Church, there are many Christians, who have the life of Christ and who belong to the church. Nevertheless, the ground upon which they stand is not the ground of the church but the ground of sects and denominations. However, since a Christian belongs to the church, he should return to the ground of the church. If he does not return to the ground of the church, he is standing on an improper ground even though he belongs to the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: By paying attention to the ground of the church, will we lose Christ as our center and become detached from Christ? Will we also become narrow-minded and thus limit the move of the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: By paying attention to the ground of the church, we are taking Christ as our center and also taking care of God&rsquo;s purpose; we are not detached from Christ. Paying attention to this ground makes Christ as our center a reality, and it also meets the need for Christ to be our center. Furthermore, when we pay attention to the ground of the church, we are caring for the intention in God&rsquo;s heart; we are not being narrow-minded or limiting the move of the Lord. Paying attention to the ground of the church does not limit the Lord&rsquo;s work; rather, it becomes a great limitation to man&rsquo;s naturalness and flesh. Any kind of correction is a great restriction and limitation to man. The truth concerning the ground of the church strongly corrects the various situations within Christianity today. It restricts many human actions. Following what is revealed in the Lord&rsquo;s Word can never limit His move or work.</p>
<p>If all of God&rsquo;s children came to the local ground, God&rsquo;s work would spread extensively. We do not mean that God works only on the ground of locality. Rather, as we have said repeatedly, God works on many different grounds. He has carried out a considerable amount of work even in the Catholic Church, which is full of fornication and idolatry. Nevertheless, the Lord&rsquo;s intention is that those who have been worked on by Him would return to the ground of locality so that He may gain a group of people for His pure testimony. This is not to limit the Lord or to be narrow-minded. After the children of Israel were taken captive, not all of them returned to Jerusalem. Some wanted to stay in Babylon. However, through His prophets God repeatedly urged His people to go back to Jerusalem, the original ground (Ezra 1:1-3; Neh. 7:5-6; Ezek. 34:13; 36:24). This was not narrow-minded or limiting. We acknowledge that the Lord works in the various Christian groups; however, many children of God are scattered on different grounds.</p>
<p><em>Question: There have been many spiritual men who neither stood on the ground of the church nor paid attention to this matter, but they were greatly blessed by the Lord and had His presence. Should we pay attention to these ones?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The age of the church is the age of grace. In this age God gives grace freely. As long as someone affords Him a little opportunity, He will give grace to that person. Hence, receiving grace is only relative; it is not absolute. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a person or a group of people who have been blessed have no problem before God, nor can we take their condition as a standard. Some in the Catholic Church have been greatly blessed. However, we cannot take the condition of the Catholic Church as our standard. This also applies to the ground of the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beginning in the age of Martin Luther, God has been moving forward in His recovery. Those who take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can measure those who took the way before them. This is because the Lord has gone further in them. However, those who took the way earlier cannot measure those who come after them according to the standard of their age, because such a measurement would be short. The Lord has never stopped with any one person but has advanced to others. For example, Mrs. Penn-Lewis could measure Andrew Murray, who was before her, in regard to identification with Christ&rsquo;s death, which was recovered through her. However, she could not use what was recovered through her to measure T. Austin-Sparks, who came after her, because the Lord advanced further to recover the matter of resurrection through Brother Sparks. Therefore, we cannot use what God recovered in the past as a standard to measure His present recovery. To do so would be inaccurate and unfair.</p>
<p>We accept all the correct and scriptural revelations that have been recovered through the past two thousand years, regardless of whom these things came from. However, we say no to everything that is not good or proper related to these things. We want the spiritual things from Madame Guyon, but we refuse to take her ground, the ground of the Catholic Church. We want the spiritual things from Mrs. Penn-Lewis, but we refuse her inaccurate expositions. Likewise, from a spiritual person, we can accept only what is spiritual, not what is murky. We are not biased. We accept everything that is right and proper that has been recovered throughout the past two thousand years, regardless of whom it came from. If the ground of the church was ordained by God originally, it must be what God desires to recover today. We cannot accept anything that makes this matter murky. We believe that God is recovering the truth concerning the ground of the church. However, quite a number of spiritual ones are not clear regarding this.</p>
<p><em>Question: Paying attention to the ground of the church easily provokes opposition. Should we avoid speaking about the ground of the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not avoid speaking the truth concerning the ground of the church simply because we fear that people will not understand and may even despise this truth. The teaching of the New Testament shows that the Lord Jesus and His disciples&rsquo; attitude and preaching were definite and clear and that they never avoided speaking something for fear of men&rsquo;s lack of understanding or disagreement. In the same way, we should vindicate what is right and condemn what is wrong. For example, when Paul saw Peter&rsquo;s hypocrisy, he was afraid that this would bring confusion into the gospel and thus opposed Peter to his face (Gal. 2:11-14). Our environment is very similar to that of Paul. Because the truth of the ground of the church is not sufficiently clear, there is confusion today. Although other people can ignore this truth, we cannot. We have no choice but to speak unreservedly until people understand and see that this is a truth in the Bible. We should never speak ambiguously in order to please people or consider that if they do not understand or accept the truth, we should speak the truth only behind closed doors. We should not be like this. Rather, we need to specifically underscore the truth that believers most urgently need to see today, that is, that the expression of the church is local and that any work apart from the local ground tears down God&rsquo;s building.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
