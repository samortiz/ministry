   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems that we are so spiritual, so Christ-like, when we come together for a meeting, but when we are in the kitchen it seems that we are anything but Christ-like.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the church we are here to do nothing else but minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To cook a good meal for the saints, to prepare a good place for meeting, to play the piano in a skillful way none of these things are meaningful unless they minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever we do in the service of the Lord should minister Christ to others.</S>
