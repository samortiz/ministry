To be holy is to have the divine, holy nature of God permeate and saturate our entire being to make our entire being as holy as God is
God's choosing and predestinating indicate one thing God's desire is to dispense Himself into our being that we may have His nature and life
Ephesians 1 also shows us that following the Father's choosing and predestinating us, the Son, Christ, came to redeem us
We were dead persons , but Christ in His redemption has healed us of all sicknesses that we might be brought back to Him and to His headship
The Spirit of God is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us to dispense all that God is and has into our being
The ink in the form of the seal will be absorbed by the paper, and they will be mingled and blended together as one entity
Now in this universe there is a group of people who have been sealed by the consummated Spirit of the Triune God
The Head of this Man is the Triune God, the dispensing One, and the Body of this Man is His issue, the issue of the dispensing God
We, the chosen ones of God the Father, have been called into a hope without limitation the Triune God as the unlimited hope to us
His unlimited self has been given to us as the unlimited hope, into which we, God's chosen ones, have been called
We are living in America, and we may say that we have been called into America to explore the riches of America for our enjoyment
The hope into which we have been called is God Himself, and the glory into which we will enter is also God Himself
In order for this to be carried out, there is the need for a group of people in God's creation to be firstly gained by this Head
We have received Him, and He has wrought Himself into us to make us one with Him, making us a group of headed up people
At the end of Ephesians 1 is God's great power, which is the power of resurrection , and this resurrection power is the processed Triune God
Many Christians have heard something about the church, but not many know the real significance of the church as the Body of Christ
God desires to have a church as the very Body of Christ to match Him as the universal Head for His full expression
Such a Spirit as the seal is sealing us all the time with all the ingredients, elements, and essence of the processed Triune God
The all-inclusive Triune God has a consummation, and this consummation is the compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit
If we go to visit another local church, do we consider ourselves as being one with the saints in that locality?
We may unconsciously feel that we belong to the organization in our locality and that now we are guests in the church which we are visiting
Wherever we are and whatever we do, we should consider ourselves as living members of the organic Body of Christ
Paul sent for the elders to come to him, and then he told them that the Holy Spirit had appointed them to be the overseers
The teaching, practice, and concept of hierarchy has led many Christians away from the church as an organism to an organization
We do not like hierarchy because it is altogether a matter of organization and has nothing to do with the organic Body of Christ
The thought of organization related to the church cannot be seen in the entire book of Ephesians, a book on the church
Because the United States is an organized government, we can see the matters of autonomy and federation to a certain extent
If a case in a court of law cannot be decided by the state court, it eventually goes to the Supreme Court, a federal court
We must be careful concerning the creeping in of different teachings related to matters such as autonomy and federation
The age of this world,' according to which we walked, refers to the modern appearance, the present course of the world, the satanic system
In the past we walked according to Satan, the ruler of the evil spiritual power, and this evil spiritual power operated in us
According to verse 3, we also behaved ourselves 'in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts'
The phrase in Christ indicates that the Triune God through the death resurrection and ascension of Christ has been dispensed into our being
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are also a poem, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
We may not think that we are so wonderful, but we have to see the divine fact that Christ is in us and that we are in Christ
As the Body of Christ the church needs Christ as its life as the new man the church needs Christ not only as its life but also as its person
The Body is for the expression of the Head, and the new man is for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
If they were independent from one another, the one new man would be cut into pieces and death would be the result
A certain financial matter may be a local administration affair, but even in such a matter, the churches should depend on one another
Sometimes a certain church should communicate, fellowship, with another church even in the matter of material needs
We are no longer strangers and sojourners but God's household, participating in the divine life and enjoying the divine riches
Ephesians 2 shows us that God remade recreated regenerated us by Christ passing through death and resurrection and entering into ascension
He came to know this mystery, which is called the mystery of Christ because it is altogether concerning Christ
The New Testament is a record of the New Testament ministry that has released what was hidden in God's heart to unveil the mystery of Christ
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but also the expression of the riches of what God is
When a cup is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water, the overflow of the water is the fullness of the water
If we want to prepare a great feast for many people, we need to have a plan to serve them with many rich dishes
God raised up apostles whom He commissioned to carry out His distributing plan, and this commission is the stewardship
Our preaching the gospel is a distribution to the God-chosen sinners of what Christ is and of what Christ has done
The apostles preached the gospel, taught the truth, set up churches, and then labored to build up the churches
What we are doing in the Lord's ministry is to distribute the riches of Christ to all the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people
When these riches are eaten, digested, and assimilated by us, they become a part of us, and they even become us
A husky American man who assimilates so much of the American foodstuffs is the fullness, the expression, of the riches of America
The church is the mystery of Christ, which is the Body of Christ constituted with the untraceable riches of Christ
Because of God's heart's desire for the church to be constituted with the riches of Christ, Paul prayed for the church
We need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts
When we get strengthened into the inner man, this opens the way for Christ to get Himself settled in our entire being
Christ making His home deep down in our hearts is an organic matter full of life and has nothing to do with any kind of organization
The second 'that' is the result of the first, the third is the result of the second, and the fourth is the result of the third
In other words, these riches will become the very fullness of God in us through our experience and enjoyment of Christ
If we talk about organization in relation to the church life, we are off from the central lane of God's New Testament economy
If some saints are living organically in Christ, enjoying Him all day long, they will become burdened to clean the hall
The saints serve, not by being hired or organizationally arranged, but by being organically one with the living Christ
About forty years ago in Shanghai, there was a sister in the church who was the wife of the manager of a big bank
Because the hall was not on an open street but in a narrow lane, the chauffeur dropped her off near the hall and drove away
One day he decided to follow her because he wanted to find out why she was going to this part of town every Saturday morning
She was the wife of a rich man who had servants cleaning his home, but every Saturday she went to the hall to do the cleaning work
Some people told us that if we were going to attempt to build the church organically, nothing would be accomplished
In the book of Revelation, the leading ones in the churches are not referred to as elders but as the stars, the messengers of the churches
If a brother is more experienced, more matured, and has more measure in the growth of Christ, he is more useful in the church
To bear more responsibility in the church, we have to eat more and grow more so that we possess a greater measure of the growth in life
We have seen that the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the Body of Christ for God's full expression
God made a plan, an arrangement, to carry out His dispensing, and this arrangement was hidden in Himself as a mystery
On the other hand, He commissioned His apostles with a stewardship to carry out His plan to distribute all the riches of Christ
The apostles distribute the riches of Christ by preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ to the God-chosen sinners
The apostles must minister more and more riches of Christ into the living members of the Body of Christ in order to perfect them
The Apostle Paul prayed that the saints would experience Christ in all of His riches for the building up of His Body
After becoming members of the Body of Christ, we have been bothered, troubled, and confused by our ugly mind, emotion, and will
The brothers are mostly in their mind, the sisters are mostly in their emotions, and all of us exercise our independent will
The spirit is the unique room, the wonderful room, the room that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth
Whenever we turn to our spirit, everything is ready for Christ to move, to work, to spread, and to root Himself in our entire being
Christ desires to spread within us, to work Himself and to root Himself deep down into every part of our inner being, our heart
Things other than Christ, such as department store sales, a Master's degree, a better car, or modern fashions, may fill up our heart
While you are thinking about other things, something is there reminding you to turn to the Lord and to call on Him
Matters such as autonomy, federation, organization, regulation, and control are foreign particles in the church, the wonderful gem
It is shameful to bring in foreign particles to this gem such as autonomy, federation, organization, regulation, and control
God through His incarnation went to the cross to accomplish an allinclusive death passed through resurrection and entered into ascension
The basic factor, the basic element, that is needed for the building up of a young church, a baby church, is for it to grow
We also did not know about God's dispensing, the mingling of God with man, or the crucial revelation of life in the Scriptures
We spent many years to study the teachings of the church fathers and the top teachings throughout the history of the church
The Lord has granted us a merciful discernment to discern what we should receive that matches the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures
There is no possibility of either autonomy or federation in a person's body because they are organizational matters
The peak is that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, and a masterpiece as the new man
We need to be warned concerning teachings that distract us away from God's central purpose to build up the organic Body of Christ
The one God and Father of all, who is over all, through all, and in all, is the source of life and the object of our worship
The Body is built by one ministry of many gifted persons perfecting the saints to do the same one building up work
For the building up of the Body, the Head has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers
Their work is 'for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
In Ephesians 4:12 'unto the work of ministry' is in apposition to 'unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
In today's Christianity, so-called ministries that are different from the apostles' ministry build up denominations
To perfect the saints is to develop their organs, equipping and furnishing them with functions through the growth in the life of Christ
The saints are perfected to do the work of the ministry for the direct building up of the Body of Christ by their growth in Christ
Verses 17-32 of Ephesians 4 is another section showing us how to build up the Body of Christ by the growth in Christ
Paul tells us that we should no longer walk as the nations who walk in the vanity of the mind, estranged from the life of God
For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to put off the old man and be renewed in the spirit of our mind
When a piece of paper is sealed with a seal, the paper receives the ink essence and also the likeness and the shape of the seal
The sealing Spirit brings the essence of the Triune God into us and causes us to bear the likeness of the Triune God
To practice the Body life we need to forgive one another, forgetting one another's offending, as God in Christ forgets our offenses
Ephesians 4:17-32 gives us a picture of a life that can carry out the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ
There is much, much hope, promise, and potential that all the churches in the Lord's recovery could be built up in this way
In the previous chapter, we saw from Ephesians 4 that the church is one unique Body which is built up by the one New Testament ministry
To participate in this building up ministry we need to live a life that is full of God's reality and God's grace
We need to be daily and continually renewed in the spirit of the mind the wonderful mingled spirit which fills occupies and directs our mind
Ephesians 4 also shows us that such a life requires that we no longer walk in vanity and that we give no place to the evil one, the Devil
Such a life qualifies us and enables us to participate in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ
In chapter three Paul unveils that we are supplied with the riches of Christ to be the fullness of the Triune God
In Ephesians 5 Paul goes on to tell us something further concerning the Body of Christ from another angle or point of view
To be the children of light who walk in love and light is to be prepared to participate in the bride of Christ
According to Ephesians 4, we need grace and truth for the life that qualifies us to participate in the building up of the Body of Christ
When we receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior and our life, we are brought into fellowship with the Father to enjoy Him as love and light
The Son is the expression of love, which to us is grace, and this grace brings us to the source of grace, which is the Father as love
Jesus Christ brings us to the Father, who is love as the source of grace and who is light as the source of truth
We have a person in us who loved us, and now by this person, in this person, and with this person we can love as He loved
When the wedding of the Lamb comes, we, the children of light, will be a bride to satisfy the One who loves us
Why would you not spend this time to pray for a certain brother who has been backsliding for years and never comes to the meetings?
The reason we might be foolish to waste our time by unnecessary shopping is that we do not know the will of the Lord
At four in the afternoon his grandfather would return home, wash and dress up, and go to visit people concerning Christ nearly every day
He lowered Himself in position and status to go to Samaria to meet a sinful woman and to go to Jericho to meet the sinner Zaccheus
Many have found out that when they went out to knock on people's doors and baptized someone, they were filled in this way
Even among the teenagers, the seventeen and eighteen year olds may prefer not to be with the thirteen and fourteen year olds
Christ sanctifies the church that He might present the church to Himself not only holy but also glorious for expressing God
As we have seen, the church as the Body of Christ needs Christ as its life, and the new man needs Christ as his person
Chapter six of Ephesians shows us that we need not only to wrestle for the church, but also to love Christ in incorruptibility
