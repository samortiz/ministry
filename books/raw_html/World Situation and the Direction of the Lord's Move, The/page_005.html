 <h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF EUROPE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Europe, in Its Geographical Location,<br />
in Its People, in Its Culture in History,<br />
and in Its Capacity in Ability, Being Crucial<br />
to the Present Situation of the World</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the importance of Europe in two things. First, Europe, in its geographical location, in its people, in its culture in history, and in its capacity in ability, is crucial to the present situation of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe, in the Consummation<br />
of the Fulfillment of the Vision concerning<br />
the Great Human Image in Daniel 2,<br />
Being Also More Vitally Crucial Than<br />
Any Other Country and Race&mdash;<br />
the Crushing of the Two Feet<br />
of the Great Human Image Being the Crushing<br />
of the Entire Human Government</h2>
<p>Further, Europe, in the consummation of the fulfillment of the vision concerning the great human image in Daniel 2, is also more vitally crucial than any other country and race&mdash; the crushing of the two feet of the great human image will be the crushing of the entire human government (vv. 34-35). We have already pointed out what this great human image prophetically typifies. The periods of history signified by the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs have been fulfilled. But the ten toes have not been fulfilled. According to Revelation 17:12, ten kings will be raised up before the great tribulation in the revived Roman Empire. They will be one with Antichrist in opposing God and persecuting His people&mdash;the Jews and the believers. These ten kings are likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (Dan. 2:42). They will submit themselves and their kingdom to Antichrist (Rev. 17:17).</p>
<p>Western culture is composed of Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. Roman politics is carrying on Western culture, and the Bible prophesies that the Roman Empire will be revived. The ten kings typified by the ten toes of the great image in Daniel 2 will be under Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire (see Revelation 17:10-11 with notes&mdash;Recovery Version). All of this will transpire in Europe.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes to crush human government, He will crush the feet with the ten toes. This will be the crushing of the entire image from the head to the feet. Daniel 2:34-35 says, &ldquo;You were watching until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; Christ is the great stone who will crush the two feet of the great image, which will be the crushing of the entire human image, the entire human government.</p>
<p>We need to see this as a basis to understand the Lord&rsquo;s mind. Before this crushing transpires, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must spread to Europe and be rooted there. The spreading of the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be a preparation for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to bring the recovery and restoration not only to Israel but also to the entire creation.</p>
<p>Of the three influential factors in today&rsquo;s world, the Far East and the United States have been occupied and taken by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Europe still remains as a region in which the Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs to be rooted and grow. I hope that we would bring this fellowship to the Lord and pray. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, these days are the consummation of the age. Lord, in these days rekindle my love toward You.&rdquo;</p>
