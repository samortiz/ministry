   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITH MAN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What did Christ say?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here is the purpose behind Christ's confounding of the young man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He wants us to realize that with men these things are impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not saying that the Lord demands everyone to sell all his possessions before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was making all those who thought that they were able realize their real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God only wants to show man that he is unable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man's life is an impotent one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no possibility for him to become able.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If man would confess his inability and give up before God, everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O young man!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O young ruler!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why do you have to depart sorrowfully?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is right to recognize your inability.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it is wrong to leave sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What you could have said was, "Lord, I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Save me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you had said this, everything would be different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's purpose is not for you to turn away, but to make you see that you are not able.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a man says, "I am able," God becomes unable in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But whenever man becomes unable, God will become able.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have exhausted our strength, God will manifest His power and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE HISTORY OF THE ISRAELITES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us look a little more into the history of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After God gave the law, the children of Israel seemingly responded in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They said that all the Lord commanded them, they would do Exo 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first commandment that God gave was that there should be no other God besides Him 20:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses received this commandment on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But even before he came down, the children of Israel had already built themselves a golden calf, saying, "This is our God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They promised easily that they would obey God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God showed them that they were unable to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This happened to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It happened to the young ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is also happening to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Over and over again, God is showing us that we are unable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>WHO CAN KEEP GOD'S LAWS?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Well, then, who can keep God's laws?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the second crucial question we have to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that every commandment in the Bible is unreasonably demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every rich man has to sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and then follow Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is this not unreasonable?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The demands of Christ are so severe; they take your life!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He says that whoever loves his father, mother, or children more than Him is not worthy to be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither is any worthy of Him who will not take up his cross to follow Him Matt 10:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this not asking for your life?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The clause concerning the bearing of the cross is especially so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The modern equivalent of the cross is to take a criminal to the execution ground with his hands and feet bound and then have him dragged through the streets for public ridicule.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you cannot be like that criminal, you are not worthy to be His disciple!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is not He demanding our life?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Again, He says, "Love your enemies" 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Mere forgiveness is close to impossible for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet He talks about loving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, we have to see that all of God's commandments are impossible to keep.</S>
