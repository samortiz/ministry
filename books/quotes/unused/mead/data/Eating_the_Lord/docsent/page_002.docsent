   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF EATING Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9, 16; Exo 12:6-8; Deut 12:6-7; 15:19-20; 16:10-11, 15; John 6:35, 57, 63; Rev 22:2, 14 THE BIBLE A BOOK OF EATING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does the Bible speak about?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is entirely correct for us to say that the Bible speaks about Christ, life, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, it is not wrong to say that the Bible speaks about wives submitting to their husbands, husbands loving their wives, children honoring their parents, and parents caring for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither is it wrong to say that the Bible speaks about humility, patience, peace, and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nor is it wrong to say that it speaks about God's love, God's light, and God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, it is not wrong to say that the Bible teaches us to worship God, to love God, and to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can list hundreds and even thousands of topics that the Bible speaks about.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the strange thing is that we may never have heard a message in Christianity telling us that the Bible speaks about eating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is true that the Bible is a book of life, a book of salvation, a book of love, and a book of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, after reading the Scripture verses above, you have to admit that the Bible is a book on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After God created man, God did not say that man needed life or salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither did He say that man needed to love and obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nor did He say that man needed to be humble or to be peaceable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God created man, He put man in a garden, and He placed man before the tree of life, telling him in effect, "Eat!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eat!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eat!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does the Bible speak about?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It speaks about eating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of book is the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a book on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible is a profound and mysterious book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not become boring even after repeated readings, and it cannot be exhausted even after you have read it a hundred times, a thousand times, or ten thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how many times you read the Bible, there are still new things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thirty years ago I already had worn out three or four Bibles from repeatedly reading them, and I thought I understood the Bible almost completely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I gradually came to realize that there are still many truths in the Bible that I have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this time if you were to ask me, "Brother Lee, what have you now uncovered from the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would say, "Now I have uncovered one word eat."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>READING THE BIBLE REQUIRING US TO DROP OUR OLD CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, this word is clearly in the Bible, yet we did not see it even after reading the Bible many times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because every old concept we have is a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is more than evident that the word eat is in the Bible, yet we could not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is due to the fact that we have our old preconceived notions, our old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The verses in the Scripture reading from the book of Deuteronomy contain a statement that is repeated many times: "You shall eat, you and your households" 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet we may not see this even after numerous times of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when we read Joshua 24, we clearly see a sentence such as, "As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah" v. 15 . This sentence is spoken only once in the sixty-six books in the Bible, but every Christian sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because our natural concept is to serve God; we simply do not have the concept of eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, even after having read the verses on this subject a thousand times, we still may not see the word eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eating is in the Bible, but it is not in your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, the word serve is in your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Honestly speaking, even without Joshua 24, according to your mentality you would always say, "I and my household will serve Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It just so happens that the Bible has such a verse that corresponds with your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the idea is quickly imprinted in your mind immediately after you have read the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not to read the Bible into your mind; rather, it is to read your mind into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is our problem with respect to reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God says that His thoughts are not our thoughts, yet we are not willing to drop our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every time you come to read the Bible, you are not actually reading the Bible; you are reading your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, day after day you have the concept that wives should submit to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, one day when you come to Ephesians 5 concerning wives submitting to their husbands and husbands loving their wives, you are quick to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, you may not see the many more important words in the Bible, even though you have read them again and again.</S>
