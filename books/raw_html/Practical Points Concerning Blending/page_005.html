Lord, we tell You that we need You all the time. This morning, even the more, we ask You to come down to visit us, to touch every heart and every spirit and open up the minds of the entire congregation. Lord, anoint us; anoint our mouths to speak, and anoint our ears to hear. Give us the understanding. Open the heavens to us. Open Yourself, even open Your heart; and also open us toward You. We desire to hear Your word from Your heart. Lord, we do not like to have a doctrine or teaching in dead letters. We are not here for this. We are here for touching You deeply in the depths of Your word. We do not want to be skating on the surface; we desire to go down to the bottom to see You, to see Your heart, to see what You want today. Even today while we are in Your recovery, we want to know what Your move is. Lord, grant us the revelation. Grant us a vision. Grant us the seeing that we need. Lord, be one spirit with us in speaking and in hearing. Amen.
