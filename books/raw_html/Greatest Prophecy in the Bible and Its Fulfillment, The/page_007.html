        <h2 class="head2">Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts.&rdquo; <em>Your</em> here is plural in number. Christ makes His home in all our hearts. Surely this means that Christ is a person. If He were not a person, how could He make His home in your heart? If you put a desk into your apartment, you do not say that the desk makes its home in that apartment. But suppose I go to settle in your apartment. You would say, &ldquo;Brother Lee is making his home in my apartment.&rdquo; This is because I am a living person. Likewise, Christ is a living person, so He can make His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>In order to know how Christ can make His home in our hearts, we have to know some other big terms, such as <em>the stewardship of the grace of God, the economy of the mystery,</em> and <em>the eternal purpose of God,</em> which God purposed in eternity in Christ (vv. 2, 9, 11). Before the foundation of the world, before creation, God in eternity past made a purpose; that is, He made a plan, to dispense Himself into a group of human beings so that they might have Him living within them not only as their life but also as their person that they might be fully one with Him to be His Body, His expression. After God&rsquo;s plan, He started to create. Then in time God came into His creation by the way of incarnation. He was incarnated into the human race, into a young virgin. He came into His creation to become the life and person of a man of Nazareth, Jesus. From that time, on this earth and in this universe, there was one man who was one with God, having God as His life and as His person. That man named Jesus was the expression of God, the vessel that contained God. Now God is going to produce more men like that man. The high level of the gospel is that God has planned to dispense Himself into you and me so that He may be one with us and so that we may be one with Him, so that He may be our life and our person and we may be His Body and His expression. God can make His home in us, and we can have an abode in God.</p>
<p>God is, no doubt, dwelling in the heavens, but He is not so satisfied with that dwelling place. If you migrate to a locality and stay in a motel, that is just a temporary dwelling for you. You are not satisfied with it and are looking to get a home. The third heaven today to God is just like that motel. Temporarily He stays there, but He is expecting to get out of that and get into the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 tells us that one day God will come down out of the heavens (v. 2). He will come out of that &ldquo;motel.&rdquo; There is a motel in the universe for God, but He would not dwell there for eternity. God desires to have a better dwelling place. The church is God&rsquo;s better dwelling place. God desires to have an eternal habitation, the habitation of God in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). This is God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying the Riches of Christ<br />
to Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>Based upon this plan God has an economy. God&rsquo;s economy is His household management, arrangement, administration, or service, to distribute, dispense, Himself into us. Through His divine dispensing of Himself into us, we are filled with the unsearchable riches of Christ in order that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:8, 19). The fullness of God implies that the riches of all that God is have become His expression. When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16). The fullness of Christ (Eph. 1:23), the embodiment of God, is the very fullness of the Triune God. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is to us, such as light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, and righteousness, what He has for us, and what He accomplished, attained, and obtained for us. These riches of Christ are unsearchable. We cannot measure how wide, how long, how high, and how deep the riches of Christ are. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Through the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s riches, we become His fullness to express Him.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit is the practical realization of all the riches of Christ, and this Spirit has come into our spirit (Rom. 8:16). We may use electricity as an illustration of this. With electricity there are many &ldquo;riches.&rdquo; It generates power, light, heat, and the ability to communicate through devices such as the telephone and television. All these items are the riches of electricity. But the riches of electricity are practically in the current of electricity. The current of electricity has been installed in our buildings, and with the installation there is the switch. When we need to apply electricity for what we need, we can turn on the switch and get it. In the same way, the heavenly electricity in the current of the Spirit has been installed in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, we are turning on the switch to apply the heavenly electricity.</p>
<p>The riches of Christ today are realized in the Spirit, and the Spirit has been fully installed in our spirit. Whenever we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we turn on the switch to enjoy the riches of Christ (Rom. 10:12). When you shut your mouth and keep silent, the switch is off. To switch on is to open up your mouth and call on the name of the Lord. God has an economy to dispense Himself into us. The Spirit with all the riches of Christ has been installed in our spirit. The more we &ldquo;switch on,&rdquo; the better. To turn the switch on is to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:16-17). It is by this switching on that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is being dispensed into us again and again, more and more. Day by day, even hour after hour, He is being dispensed into our being.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that this divine dispensing is carried out by our eating of Christ as our spiritual food (John 6:57). Eating is to take something as nourishment into your being. Then you digest and assimilate it to make its very ingredients, constituents, and elements yours. When you eat chicken, your stomach digests it, and it is assimilated into your blood to become your element. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life...He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (vv. 35, 57). What is it to eat Christ? To eat Christ is to take Christ into you, digest Him, assimilate Him, and make His element your very element. Eventually, whatever you eat becomes you. Even dietitians say that you are what you eat. If you eat chicken, the chicken eventually becomes you. In like manner, if you eat Christ, you become Christ. To eat Christ is to take Christ into you so that Christ can become your constituent, your element, and your &ldquo;organic tissues.&rdquo; Then Christ becomes you, and you are one with Christ.</p>
<p>We can take Christ in by realizing that today He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). All the items of His riches are included in this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, and He is in our spirit. When we switch on by touching our spirit, He will get into us and be assimilated by us to become us. This is to eat Jesus. By eating Jesus, all His riches become ours, and we are filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
