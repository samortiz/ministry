   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider the person who saw the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What kind of person was Ezekiel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, he was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A priest is one who lives in the presence of God, serving God and mingling himself with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ezekiel was such a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, Ezekiel was the son of Buzi.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Buzi means contempt or despised.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel was a prophet despised by the people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his ministry, he received no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If today in the Lord's recovery you are one of the Ezekiels, you will be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that you will have any glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the people will despise you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But though we may be despised by others, we should never be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must be Ezekiels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you know the meaning of the word Ezekiel?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means "God will strengthen" or the "Almighty One, your strength."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter how much people despise you, you must be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the Lord told Ezekiel that He would make his face stronger than their faces and his forehead stronger than theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His forehead would be like adamant, like a diamond, like a flint, so hard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was despised by people, but he was strengthened by God 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The name Ezekiel ends with the suffix el.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does el mean?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means the "Almighty One."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On one hand, he was the son of Buzi, despised by others, but on the other hand, he was Ezekiel, strengthened by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CONDITIONS The Heavens Being Opened</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we need to see the conditions for seeing the visions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, the heavens were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever people on this earth are one with God, the heavens will be opened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first time that the Bible mentions the heavens being opened was when Jacob was wandering in his attempt to escape from his brother, Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That night he had a dream, and in the dream the heavens were opened to him Gen 28:11-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What did this signify?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It signified that God was going to gain that naughty Jacob as His beachhead on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the heavens could be opened to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the heavens were opened to declare that there was a man on the earth who was one with God in the heavens Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the land of captivity, there was also a man, Ezekiel, who was mature and one with God so that the heavens were opened to him Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the heavens opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are today's Ezekiels, the heavens will be opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Vision Received</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only were the heavens opened, but also a vision was revealed or unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This message is not a kind of sermon that I have composed by collecting materials from different books.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is shameful to collect materials from others' books and then pass them on to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we pass on to the children of God must be something we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It must be something as a vision we have received from the open heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What I am ministering to you is not a theory, a concept, a teaching, a doctrine, or a kind of systematic theology from a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, it is a vision from the open heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An Express Word</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the word of God came to Ezekiel expressly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need an express word, not an ordinary word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For such an express word, do not go to the expositions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not even go to the books of Watchman Nee or Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must have an express word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With Ezekiel, the heavens were opened, the visions came, and the express word also came.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Hand of God</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What followed the express word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The hand of God followed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If what we minister is truly God's word God's hand will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's hand always follows His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever He says, He does.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you minister a lot, and nothing happens, this means you have a babbling mouth, but God's hand is not working.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may have a speaking mouth, but you need God's almighty hand to work out what you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, today we need the heavens opened; we need the vision coming to us; we need the word to come expressly; and we need God's hand to follow!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I were speaking and the divine hand did not follow, that would be a vain babbling and you should forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if what I am ministering here is God's express word, be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Don't touch the word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I may be a small man, but God's hand is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He will work according to His speaking.</S>
