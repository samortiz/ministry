   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 16:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 16:17-18 says, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These ones even make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teachings which we have heard, teachings, which, no doubt, are the ministry of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a very serious matter, yet Paul still did not tell us to cut off such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most we can do is to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Maybe we can also render some advice to them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not they would listen is up to them, but we should not go further than this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Titus 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Titus 3:10 says, "A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A factious man is a sectarian man, a man making divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning this verse note 102 in the Recovery Version says, "In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church's profit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul still did not say, however, to excommunicate such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to be very careful not to interpret this case as a case of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To reject does not go as far as to cast away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third John 9-10</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third John 9-10 says, "I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This situation was very serious because Diotrephes himself was casting brothers out from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, John did not tell the saints that they had to make a decision to cast Diotrephes out, although he was casting out people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second John 10</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second John 10 says, "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The teaching referred to in verse 10 is "the teaching of Christ" in verse 9 which is the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception 1 John 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son" v. 9 . If anyone comes to us and does not bring this teaching concerning Christ's deity, do not receive him into your house and do not say rejoice to him; do not greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this particular case, we should not greet such a one, we should not receive him into our house, and we surely should not receive him to the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 5:9-13</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 5:9-13 is the strongest passage concerning removing someone from the fellowship of the church: "I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with fornicators, not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or an avaricious man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man; with such a one not even to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For what have I to do with judging those who are without?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you not judge those who are within?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But those who are without God judges.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remove the evil man from among yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a clear case of removing, cutting off, an evil man from the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Timothy 1:20 and Second Timothy 4:14</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The case of Alexander the coppersmith is recorded in 1 Timothy 1:20 and 2 Timothy 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Alexander was one who attacked and opposed the Apostle Paul to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, such a one should not be taken into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these Scriptures present cases which we have to consider in our fellowship concerning receiving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not remove, cut off, someone from the fellowship of the church in a light manner, but we must do it carefully.</S>
