<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Discussing&mdash;Conferring to Rebel</h2>
<p>The process of man&rsquo;s fourth fall began with a discussion, a conference (v. 3). These corrupted people came together to confer over the matter of rebellion. They were created and governed by God originally, yet they met together to confer and discuss their intention to rebel. This was extremely wicked.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Bricks&mdash;<br />
Human Labor Plus the Mud of the Earth</h2>
<p>After their discussion, they took a further step of making bricks and burning them thoroughly (v. 3). The Bible always mentions the use of stones in relation to God&rsquo;s building and the use of bricks in relation to man&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Let us consider four items in God&rsquo;s work. According to Exodus 20:25, the altar was built with stones. It was not only built with stones but with stones in their original form, that is, unhewn stones. When the children of Israel built an altar with stones, they could not use tools. This means that the element of human labor should not be added to God&rsquo;s work. The temple in 1 Kings 6:7 was also built with stones. In addition, the city of Jerusalem was built with stones, and the city of the New Jerusalem, whose Architect and Builder is God (Heb. 11:10), will be built with precious stones (Rev. 21:18-20). God&rsquo;s building work involves stones, whereas man&rsquo;s building work involves bricks. The tower of Babel was built with bricks, and the two storage cities of Pharaoh were also built with bricks (Exo. 1:11, 14; 5:7-8).</p>
<p>Stones are natural and God-made; bricks are produced by human labor with the mud of the earth, that is, by using human labor to burn and harden the mud of the earth. God&rsquo;s work, however, is made with stones, meaning that God builds everything with something of Himself as the material. In contrast, man&rsquo;s work is made with bricks, meaning that it is accomplished with human labor using earthy things void of the element of God. Genesis 11:3 says that man used &ldquo;brick for stone&rdquo; when the tower of Babel was being built. This meant that man replaced God&rsquo;s work with his own work. In the Bible all the things made by man are &ldquo;bricks,&rdquo; that is, something of the earth plus human labor. Everything produced by human labor and earthy material is brick.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a City&mdash;a Self-made, Godless Living</h2>
<p>After producing bricks, the people built a city. When reading Genesis 11, most people focus on the tower of Babel rather than on the city of Babel. This is not accurate, because verse 4 plainly says, &ldquo;They said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower.&rdquo; This verse mentions a city and then a tower. Hence, the emphasis is not on the tower but on the city. We know that a city is the center of human life, and therefore, it is a symbol of human life. A city made of bricks is a symbol of a life built by human labor, that is, a life without God. This shows that the kind of life that man builds does not have God, does not want God, does not rely on God, and is not for God. The city of Babel symbolizes such a life. The city of Babel represents a living produced by a group of fallen, rebellious people who put God aside, deny God&rsquo;s right and authority, and use their human labor on the things of the earth. Such a life has man but not God, wants man but not God, relies on man but not God, and is for man but not God. Such a living is symbolized by the city of Babel.</p>
<p>People on the earth today, including those in so-called religions, are still building the city of Babel. It is possible that even many works in Christianity are cities built only with human labor. If the work that we are doing in God&rsquo;s name is really being done by ourselves and for ourselves, our work is building only the city of Babel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a Tower&mdash;<br />
a Declaration of the Renouncing of God</h2>
<p>After building a city, the next step was to build a tower. In chapter 11 the people built a city and then a tower. The city was central, whereas the tower was auxiliary. Using an analogy, we can say that the city was like a tomb, and the tower was like a tombstone that declared who is in a tomb. The tower of Babel was an epitaph, a declaration, of the city of Babel. Since the city of Babel is a symbol of a godless life built by men apart from God, the tower of Babel is a declaration that their life denied God and rejected His right and authority.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making a Name for Man&mdash;<br />
Renouncing God&rsquo;s Name, That Is,<br />
Renouncing God</h2>
<p>The building of the tower of Babel not only declared that the people did not want God but that they wanted to make a name for themselves. Their renouncing of God&rsquo;s name was actually their renouncing of God. Their making a name for themselves was actually their exalting of themselves. Genesis 4:26 says that men began to call upon the name of Jehovah at the time of Enosh. The name <em>Enosh</em> means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; When a person truly knows the vanity and frailty of human life, he will prostrate himself before God, call on God&rsquo;s name, and exalt God&rsquo;s name. However, men exalted their own name, making a name for themselves. Chapter 11 shows that people fell to the uttermost by building a city and a tower in order to make a name for themselves. However, God would not allow them to succeed in their conspiracy.</p>
