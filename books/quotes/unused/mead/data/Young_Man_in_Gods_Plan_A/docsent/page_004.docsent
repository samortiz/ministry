   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING OURSELVES EMPTY, OPEN,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FRESH, NEW, LIVING, AND YOUNG WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first young man used by God in the Scriptures was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God did not create an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "old" came from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If man had never fallen, he could never be old.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If man had never fallen, it would have been possible for him to live many years and not become old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God had no intention to have many old men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's intention is to have many young men with every one fresh, new, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>None of us should be old.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be old means to be set, settled, and occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes some of the saints would refer to me as an old brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that this is a respect to me, but actually I do not like to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not look upon myself as an old brother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am not set, settled, and occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We always need to exercise to be young, to be new, to be renewed, to be fresh, and to be living all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is only when you are young that there is a possibility for God to come in to call you, to choose you, and to use you to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to give the Lord the way to go on in His progressive move through us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that you will be a living, fresh, and new channel for the Lord to go on in His own way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will require you to offer yourself to Him, to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When D. L. Moody was a young man, he heard someone say that something wonderful would be worked out on this earth if a man would offer himself fully to God, to be fully possessed and occupied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he heard that word, he immediately responded to it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He gave himself fully to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the secret as to why God could use D. L. Moody so much and why the Lord could go on quite a distance of His way through D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that we would take this fellowship and tell the Lord, "Lord, I thank You that I am still young.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want there to be anything set, settled, or occupied with me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to be fully open to You for Your new move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Come in and occupy, take, and possess me for Your up-to-date move on this earth."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would pray to the Lord in this way, we will be the persons who will turn, who will transfer, the age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is always something new to be worked out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy Spirit is now working and moving in the hearts of the children of God for the carrying out of His move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is ready, but He is waiting for some people to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The situation in today's religion cannot satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God wants to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants to do something new in life, in knowing Christ, in experiencing Christ, in preaching Christ, in dispensing Christ, and in expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The doctrines, the forms, the organization, the rituals, the regulations of organized religion, and the miraculous gifts cannot satisfy God nor can they fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are not what God's heart's desire is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God wants to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He desires that Christ Himself would be known, realized, experienced, and expressed in a full and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are occupied with the miraculous gifts or with Bible knowledge, God cannot come in to use you for His up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are settled into a certain form, organization, or ritual, you cannot be used by the Lord to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to be new, empty, and open, telling the Lord that you are here for nothing on this earth but for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to tell the Lord that we are not here for religion, nor are we focused on teachings, doctrines, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we are here one hundred percent for Christ Himself as the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you would be so fresh, young, and new with the Lord, He would have a way to carry out His new move through you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why the Lord said in Luke 18:17, "Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A little child, not filled with and occupied by old concepts, can easily receive a new thought.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, people need to receive the kingdom of God as a new thing, with an unoccupied heart, like a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may be an older brother in years, and yet still be young in the spirit because you are not set, settled, or occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we open ourselves absolutely to the Lord, He has a way to dispense something new, fresh, and real of Himself, of His thought and desire, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the Lord gain a group of people in these days to turn the age for His new move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I could help others to be saved and to be raised up to love the Lord, to seek after the Lord, this would make me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I would not really be satisfied until I knew that a good number of saints could be used by the Lord in His hand to turn the age through their life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not merely fellowshipping concerning salvation or spirituality, but we are dealing with God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The young people need to realize that this is their golden time to be used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord needs you as a channel through which He can carry out His move.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way for you to grasp this opportunity is to go to the Lord to open and empty yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You need to give yourself to Him and allow Him to take you, to possess you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Never have something within your being set, settled, or occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Keep yourself empty, open, fresh, new, living, and young with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the Lord will be able to go on through you in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all need to consecrate ourselves once again to the Lord for His eternal purpose.</S>
