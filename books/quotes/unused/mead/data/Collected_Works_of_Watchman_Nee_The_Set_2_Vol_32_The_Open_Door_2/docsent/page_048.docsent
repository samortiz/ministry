   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Fei Chang-bau, Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From Issue No. 8 of The Open Door, I learned that you have recuperated from your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank God for His great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although I am separated from you in body, my heart has been constantly in fellowship with you before the Lord, and I often have mentioned your name and prayed for you before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Four years ago God revived His own work in the churches in Nan-Sha.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The churches which long had been dormant have had a big turn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can only thank and praise the Lord with all our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I see that God is raising up a group of workers in Nan-Sha for the building up of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are now seven places with the Lord's table, and three other places are about to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recently, God raised up a group of gospel preachers to preach the gospel in the mountain villages around Shao-Shing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has started His work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The door of preaching is now open, and soon churches will be established.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Shan Kai-fen often comes to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the political situation is tense, God has given us peace under His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has shown me that if a servant of God is humble before God and men, God will continually use him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if he becomes proud, he will immediately be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David and Saul can be examples to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a church is in one accord, it will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout history there have always been two groups of people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are the fleshly ones and the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fleshly ones always persecute the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God's sovereignty always turns things to the benefit of the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fleshly ones continually persecute the spiritual ones so that the self of the spiritual ones will die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will deal with the fleshly ones and will save the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May we pray for each other before the Lord so that His plan will soon be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord be with us until He returns, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fei Chang-bau, July 11</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>...Presently, there are no workers here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa and others do not have the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, the meeting that is on the line of the work i.e., the Lord's Day morning meeting was stopped temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has shown us that there is a difference between the church and the work and has taught us to obey this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Lord's arrangement, we have no more meetings on the line of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But all the meetings of the local church continue as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although most of the brothers and sisters are unaccustomed to this practice, we cannot easily invite people to preach, because we have to care for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, we feel that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai have been overfed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We would rather allow them to go hungry for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they feel the need again, our Lord will surely provide....</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yu Cheng-hwa, Wu You-an, Du Tsong-chen, Lin Kwang-biao</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>August 28</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please give our regards to Sisters Wang and Chang, Brother Chang Yu-zhi, and Mr. and Mrs. Yuen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I received your two letters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am concentrating on the work for the Lord and have no clear assurance yet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the near future, I will have to find some way to support myself and wait on God's leading through a job.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Over thirty brothers who fled from the war in Chekiang arrived here safely.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are now being accommodated at the Yi-Yang Relief Center.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please pray for them until, as you hoped, they no longer have a need to be supported by others and are self-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peace to you in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, August 15</S>
