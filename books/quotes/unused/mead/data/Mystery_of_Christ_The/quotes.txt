[2]  This book contains a series of messages given by Watchman Nee in Shanghai in 1939 on the mystery of Christ.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-6; John 12:32; Luke 12:50-52 THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE AGES
[4]  In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of his understanding of the mystery of Christ.
[5]  Since the nature of the new man the church is Christ, we can say that the church is Christ.
[6]  In this message we will speak on the Body of Christ.
[7]  In the New Testament, Paul was the only apostle who used the expression the Body of Christ to denote the church.
[8]  In other places in the New Testament, the church is called the temple of God, the household of God, etc. But Paul specifically said that the church is the Body of Christ.
[9]  Even if we have all the knowledge there is about the Body of Christ, we still may not have seen the Body of Christ or touched the reality of the Body.
[10]  The work of the cross goes as far as the Body of Christ and consummates with the Body of Christ.
[11]  BEING A BELIEVER AND BEING A MEMBER Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col 3:10-11; Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:4-16, 20, 26
[12]  In the last two messages we saw that the church is the corporate Christ, and we saw also that in order to know the Body of Christ, we have to deal with our natural life.
[13]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 2:15; Col 3:10-11; 1 Cor 12:20-21; Rom 12:3-6 THE NEED FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY
[14]  Every Christian should know that he is only a member.
[15]  In the Body all the members must be joined together before they can become the Body.
[16]  Many of us have the experience that when we are dry and have no way to go on, we need other brothers and sisters to intercede for us before we can get through.
[17]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND MINISTRY OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 2:15 THE PROTECTION OF THE BODY
[18]  This Body renders supply to every member of the Body.
[19]  If you are simply a believer, you can act as you please, but if you are a member of the Body, then you must allow yourself to be limited by the other members.
[20]  The cross leads to the Body, and the cross operates in the sphere of the Body.
[21]  In the church meeting every member should function according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[22]  Then we will see that we are members of the Body of Christ, that we need the protection and limitation of the Body, and that we need to function in the Body and supply other members so that the life of the Body will flow in an unhindered way.
[23]  CHAPTER SIX AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 2:15; 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col 2:19; 3:10-11 THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY RESTING IN THE HEAD
[24]  The Bible emphatically tells us that Christ is the Head.
[25]  One day God will head up everything in the universe under Christ.
[26]  Paul spoke of "holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God" Col 2:19 .
[27]  Since Christ is the Head of the Body, we have to hold the Head.
[28]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE ANOINTING OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27; Luke 3:22; 4:18; Eph 4:1-10, 30-32; Psa 133
[29]  The Bible shows us that God's anointing is only for the One who has totally satisfied God's heart His Son, Christ.
[30]  If this is so, why does the Body receive the anointing?
[31]  The anointing is so precious because grace flows from the Head to the Body by means of the anointing.
[32]  The function of the anointing is to maintain the link between the Head and the Body, as well as the link between all the members.
[33]  In the Old Testament men had God's word the law.
[34]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE ORDER OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-8; Eph 4:9-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 11:29 THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS
[35]  First Corinthians 12:18 says, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed."
[36]  Every member has a particular portion with which he serves the Body of Christ.
[37]  Ephesians 4:11 speaks of a group of people who are for the Body; they are God's gifts to the church, supplying Christ for the building up of the Body.
[38]  In addition, in the local assembly there are members who have the right to exercise authority.
[39]  CHAPTER NINE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Acts 6:6; 8:4-5, 12, 14-17; 9:3-6, 10-12, 17; 19:6; James 5:14-16; Matt 18:15-16, 19-20; 1 Tim 4:14; 5:22; 2 Tim 1:6 THE APOSTLES' LAYING ON OF HANDS
[40]  There is an example in Acts 8 that shows us the principle of the Body.
[41]  In James 5:14-16 we see the laying on of hands in relation to sickness.
[42]  CHAPTER TEN THE RICHES IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: Deut 32:30; Psa 133; Eph 1:23; 2:20-22; 3:10, 18-19; 4:13; 6:11; 1 Cor 12:27; Matt 18:15-18 THE MEASURE OF CHRIST
[43]  The Body of Christ is not only universal; it is also local.
[44]  The local church, being the local expression of the Body of Christ, has the headship of Christ and, therefore, can know the mind of Christ, which is always communicated to His Body.
[45]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MINISTRY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:4-31 SEEING THE REVELATION
[46]  A Christian must see not only that he is a believer but also that he is a member of the Body.
[47]  First Corinthians 12 tells us that all the members should seek the gifts and ministries.
[48]  God's intention is to have special members fulfill special ministries, using them as channels for the Lord's life to flow into the Body and to increase the measure of the Body through them.
[49]  When the life we receive from the Lord flows into the Body, the measure of the stature of the Body increases.
[50]  What we minister to the Body is Christ, and what the Body receives is Christ, because Christ is all and in all in the Body.
[51]  First Corinthians 12:4-30 is divided into four sections:
