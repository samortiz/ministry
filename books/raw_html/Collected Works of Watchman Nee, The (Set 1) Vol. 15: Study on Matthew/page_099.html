<P>Verses 48-51:"But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." Verses 48-51 are also divided into four sections: (1) Is the evil slave a Christian? (2) What error has he made? (3) The reason for the error of the evil slave. (4) The result.</P><P>(1) Is the evil slave a Christian? Yes, he is a Christian; he is saved. The reasons are: (a) This evil slave is the slave appointed by the Lord in verse 45. The Lord's commission is neither like man's laying on of hands nor like the setting up of committees or supervisors. Man's laying on of hands and appointment may contain mistakes. The Lord does not make this kind of mistake in His appointments. This evil slave is the same person as the faithful and prudent slave. Whether he is a faithful slave or an evil slave depends on how he serves. (b) Identifying the Lord as "my master" shows that he has a personal relationship with the Lord, and "in his heart" also substantiates this fact (just to confess with the mouth may not prove his relationship). See also Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 12:3. (c) He believed in and also waited for the Lord's coming again. His only mistake was that he thought the Lord would delay His coming. Those who are not saved would not say this.</P><P>The above three points are most obvious. But many think that this slave is not saved, based on his conduct and the punishment he receives. They think: (1) if he were saved, how could he beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink? The fact of the matter is that a saved Christian is still capable of committing any kind of sin. In 1 Corinthians 5 there was an adulterer, but he was still saved (v. 5). (2) The Lord appointed his portion with the hypocrites. This word "with" is very important. It is clearer in Luke 12:46: "And will appoint his portion with the unbelievers." From this we know that he is not an unbeliever. (3) "Cut him asunder." One cannot trust in a literal interpretation of this, because otherwise, how can there be weeping and gnashing of teeth in the succeeding part of the verse? In the original text to "cut asunder" does not mean to put to death; it means only to separate him from the Lord. Read Luke 12:46-48. There is a possibility that a slave may be whipped; however, to be whipped does not mean to perish, because the Lord's sheep never perish (John 10:27-28).</P><P>(2) What errors did the evil slave make? There are two sins in verse 49: (a) to beat his fellow slaves (this is toward the believers within) and (b) to eat and drink with the drunken (this is toward the unbelievers without). To beat means to abuse the authority given by the Lord. To eat and drink means to have fellowship with the world, to traffic with the world. Discipline is in God's hand. Between brothers, there can at most be a rebuke. To beat is to usurp God's disciplinary authority. Whenever you think you have special authority to rule over a fellow slave, you are beating. Matthew 23:8 says, "You are all brothers." To beat a brother also means to lose the ability for self-control. When you do not smite others, you rule over yourself. To beat does not necessarily mean to use a stick or a whip or a rod. It means to cause people to suffer pain or to be wounded. If you hurt others with your words, or if you cause pain and suffering to others through your meanness or sarcasm, that is also to beat. If the purpose is to make others feel bad for three or five days so that you can feel better, this also, in reality, is to beat. We can only use oil and wine to heal wounds; we cannot perform surgery. God's children already have enough sorrows. How can we add more painful wounds to them! Yet he who is proud and independent and has a temper finds it easy to beat others.</P><P>The evil slave is also associated with the world. In the Bible the "drunken" are those who indulge themselves in the world. When man becomes stupefied through wine, he is drunk. Today man becomes stupefied because of money, wealth, a name, etc. This also is to be drunk. The slave is a believer; therefore, he should not have fellowship with the drunkards (in accordance with the teaching of 2 Corinthians 6). In the Bible, eating and drinking specifically imply fellowship. The first sin of the world occurred when two were eating together (Gen. 3:6). After Lot quarreled with Abraham, he began to have fellowship with the world (13:5-13). Whenever you dislike a brother and instead like the people of the world, you are fallen. The above two sins are easily committed by any believer.</P><P>(3) What is the reason for these errors? The reason is seen in verse 48: "My master delays." The slave believed that the Lord was coming again, but he also believed that He was delaying His coming. Anyone who does not believe that the Lord is coming quickly is an evil slave. The reason for the slave's mistake, according to what the Lord said, is in verse 48. Even though with his mouth he said that the Lord would come quickly, in his heart he still considered that the Lord would delay. This kind of person is in peril. If one does not take the attitude that the Lord will come quickly, he will not be watchful.</P><P>Many people do not want the Lord to come quickly. They are afraid that when the Lord comes, He will spoil and terminate their plans. They cannot pray John's prayer: "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). We must have an attitude and a desire for the Lord to come quickly. To merely know the prophecy well is of no use. The evil slave was also well versed in prophecy.</P><P>(4) The result: the Lord came a little sooner than the slave expected. If you think that the Lord will delay, He will come sooner than you expect. In His punishment the Lord will separate you from Himself and will appoint your portion with the hypocrites. To be appointed a portion with someone does not necessarily mean to suffer the same punishment as that one. The prisoners in a jail have all been appointed the same portion which is the prison, but they do not all experience the same kind of punishment. To be appointed the same portion means to suffer together. "There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." This signifies much regret and remorse.</P>
