<P>Concerning verse 2, Spurgeon said that if someone is a leper yet he does not come to worship the Lord, his leprosy must be very serious. In Mark 9:22-23, the man said, "If you can...." It was a questioning of the Lord's power, and that is why the Lord rebuked him. Here, the leper said, "Lord, if You are willing." This is a matter of the heart. The leper did not doubt the Lord; he just did not know whether or not the Lord was willing. The Lord said, "I am willing," meaning "I am definitely willing." Thus, we can see the Lord's heart toward the sick ones.</P><P>Verse 4: "Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." This is because at that time the law had not been abolished. Only through the death of the Lord can we be freed from the requirements of the law, as shown in Romans 7:4. At that time the Lord had not yet died; therefore, they had to follow the law.</P><P>Verses 5-10: Fever is an abnormal power; paralysis is an abnormal weakness; and leprosy is an abnormal filthiness. To have great faith is to believe in God's authority. God's authority and God's word go together. For instance, "God said, Let there be light: and there was light." God created the heavens and the earth by His authority. The Greek word for power literally means "dynamite." The Greek word for authority denotes a very marvelous power that can subdue everything. People today pay attention to power but do not care for authority. Men commit sin because they overthrow the authority of God. During the time of the great tribulation, all the people in the world will try to use their power to overthrow God's authority. Satan is what he is because he wants to overthrow the authority of God. Not only will he not submit himself to the authority of God; he also stirs people up to oppose God. However, Christ withstood Satan with authority. The sharp sword coming out of the Lord's mouth is the power behind His authority. God does not use power to directly rule over the world. Therefore, Christians today should learn to submit themselves under the authority of God.</P><P>Verses 11-13: When the Lord mentioned the kingdom of the heavens, He did not specify whether it is in the present or in the future. Some say it refers to the present age. If so, then verse 11 cannot be explained. But in chapter eleven, verses 11-12, it seems that the kingdom of the heavens is in the present age. In Matthew 5:3 it is in the future because it is related to reward.</P><P>"The kingdom of God" is mentioned five times in Matthew. God's kingdom is God's sovereign authority. There must be a difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens; otherwise, the Lord would not have used a different term. The kingdom of God is both today and in the future.</P><P>The way to explain the question is to first look for the facts, the phenomena, and then look for the explanation. The major sections: (1) Chapters one through four are the first major section. (2) Chapters five through seven are the second major section. (3) Chapters eight through nine are the third major section. The minor sections: 8:1-17 is divided into four small sections: (1) verses 2-4, the cleansing of the leper; (2) verses 5-13, the healing of the paralytic servant; (3) verses 14-15, the healing of the fever of Peter's mother-in-law; and (4) verses 16-17, the healing of many who were ill.</P><P>The four titles of the Lord on the earth as the Son are: (1) the Son of God, (2) the Son of Man, (3) the Son of Abraham, and (4) the Son of David. In the four small sections in chapter eight we see the Lord as the Son in four ways: (1) In the cleansing of the leper He is the Son of God—this is in relation to the Jews. (2) In the healing of the paralytic, He is the Son of Abraham—this is because of faith and because it is in relation to the Gentiles. (3) In the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, He is the Son of David—this is in relation to the Jews in the future. (4) In the casting out of demons and in the healing of all men, He is the Son of Man—this is in relation to all people.</P><P>Verse 14: "And Jesus, coming into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever." The word "house" is one of the key words in this book. It refers to the Jews. In the Bible this word has its special significance. The same word is used in Matthew 2:11. In Matthew's record, the magi saw the Lord in the house; in Luke's record, the Lord was found in the manger by the shepherds.</P><P>The Lord healed the leper in the open air, not in a house. Coming into the house is an indication of intimate communication. Here it shows that there were only a few Jews who received salvation at the Lord's first coming. The Lord came to Peter's house to heal Peter's mother-in-law. A house is a place of intimacy and affection. This shows that all the Jews will be saved in the future. The Lord healed both the leper and Peter's mother-in-law by touching them. This indicates that the Lord has a special relationship with the Jews. Verses 16 and 17 show what the Lord will do in the coming kingdom. Matthew recorded the events in this way because the order in this book is according to doctrine.</P><P>Verse 15: "And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him." The Lord's touch is powerful. Once He touches us, His power contacts our weakness. Wherever the Lord touches, Satan has no more ground.</P><P>Verse 16: "And when evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed." "Many" here means a great many, a multitude. Here the Lord cast out demons "with a word"; this is a reflection of the case where the Lord healed the paralytic by speaking a word, as seen in the second small section. This shows that the Lord is the Son of God. "Brought to Him." This is to stand in a position where one can receive the blessing of the Lord.</P>
