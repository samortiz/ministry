<h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP<br />
IN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Old Testament presents a type, whereas the New Testament is the reality. On the day of Pentecost, the number of disciples increased from one hundred twenty to more than three thousand (Acts 2:41). Later, another five thousand were added (4:4). In the book of Acts we can see clearly that there was a line of authority among the disciples. Although the Bible does not use this term, we can surely sense that Peter, John, and James represented God&rsquo;s authority. The elders in the churches also represented this authority. At the same time, the service of the apostles and the saints was full of fellowship. They fellowshipped with God and brought God&rsquo;s fellowship to His people. During the days of the early church, there was order and authority as well as the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this condition did not last long. The church gradually became desolate, just as the Israelites in the Old Testament; that is, the church had problems related to the matter of fellowship. Once the fellowship was lost, the authority became improper. This authority became so improper that eventually the church fell completely into the realm of human organization, being entirely under man&rsquo;s rule. The eventual result of this fall was the establishment of Roman Catholicism, which brought God&rsquo;s people into an improper situation of utter desolation.</p>
<p>For the church to be recovered, the reality of the priesthood had to be restored, just as in the Old Testament. When Luther rose up to recover the matter of justification by faith, the matter of fellowship with God was restored. Although Luther paid attention to the matter of authority and order, it was the Moravian brothers who recovered the matter of authority and order in the eighteenth century. They also experienced the matter of fellowship. In the nineteenth century the Brethren had a very strong recovery of the aspect of fellowship. They fellowshipped with God and with one another; this was truly a great blessing from God to them. Their fellowship was such that they were in one spirit as one man. Gradually, authority and order were also recovered among them.</p>
<p>Our own history also began with the recovery of fellowship. Not only was personal fellowship with God recovered but also mutual fellowship with one another in the Lord. Then the Lord began to show us truth and light concerning the church, the Body, and service in coordination so that we would know the matter of authority and order. Based on His leading among us, there has been the appointment of elders and the arrangement of service. Even now, the matter of authority and order is becoming more and more practical among us.</p>
<p>However, we must remember the lessons of history. It is not easy to maintain a normal condition of fellowship in coordination with authority. If we are not careful, fellowship will be lost, and only authority will remain. If this occurs, the exercise of authority will not be balanced, and our condition will become abnormal. I am speaking concerning this matter with a fully guarded heart. I hope that all the brothers and sisters would have such an inner sense. There is a danger that we would gradually lose the matter of fellowship. If the fellowship among us is weakened, authority will become more prominent than fellowship. This will result in an unbalanced and abnormal situation. Since there is such a danger among us, we should be on guard. This does not mean that we should do away with authority and order; rather, it means that we should strengthen the matter of fellowship. Otherwise, we may speak of building up and endeavor to practice the building up, but the more we endeavor, the stronger authority will become and the weaker fellowship will become. This will result in an unbalanced situation. Hence, before we endeavor to strengthen the building up of the church, we must have a clear view concerning this matter. If we lack the balance from fellowship while pursuing the matter of building up, the aspect of authority will become stronger and stronger among us, while the aspect of fellowship will lose more and more ground. This will cause an extreme imbalance among us, and eventually, we will become altogether abnormal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BLENDING OF THE SPIRITS OF THE SAINTS<br />
AS ONE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Fellowship refers to personal fellowship with God and mutual fellowship among us. These are not two different kinds of fellowship but rather two aspects of one fellowship. Proper fellowship always includes fellowship between us and the Lord and between us and the saints. Inwardly, we must have a clear flow of fellowship with God and with the saints, just as the blood in a physical body flows to the head and to all the members. No member can say that his blood flows only to the head but not to the other members. If his blood does not flow to the other members, there will be a big problem in the circulation of blood. This is a very clear example. Fellowship does not refer only to fellowship with God, but even more, it refers to fellowship with other saints in the fellowship of God.</p>
<p>In the past, when we spoke of fellowship with God, we often considered it only in relation to our fellowship with God. Even when we spoke of fellowshipping with the saints, our understanding was limited to the thought of interacting with the saints. Actually, this is not the meaning of fellowship. Fellowship with God includes fellowship with the saints, and fellowship with the saints comes out of fellowship with God. Fellowship includes more than outward communication and outward associations; it involves the blending of the spirits of the saints in the Spirit of God, all of whom are blended as one.</p>
<p>If we exercise according to this understanding, we will discover that there is no difference between fellowshipping with the saints and fellowshipping with God. When we fellowship with God, our spirit has a clear way to fellowship with the saints, and when we fellowship with the saints, praying, worshipping, giving thanks, and praising, our spirits have a clear way to fellowship with God. These two aspects of fellowship speak of one flow, not two flows. When a light bulb is connected to the power plant through the flow of electricity, it is also connected to other light bulbs. At the same time, when a light bulb is connected to other light bulbs, it is also connected to the power plant. There is only one flow, not two flows.</p>
<p>We must see that the fellowship of the church is the fellowship of God and the fellowship of the Body. The fellowship of the Body is the fellowship of the saints with God; it is also the fellowship among the saints in the fellowship of God. It is regrettable that we consider fellowship with God and fellowship with other saints as being two different things. We must be corrected and begin to see that these two aspects of fellowship are related and are even one. When we fellowship with God, our fellowship includes the brothers and sisters, and when we fellowship with the brothers and sisters, our fellowship includes God. In one spirit the saints fellowship with one another and with God. If this is not our experience, our fellowship is problematic.</p>
