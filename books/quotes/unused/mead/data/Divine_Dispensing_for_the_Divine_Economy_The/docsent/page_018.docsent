   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One God as the Father of All, Who Is</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>over All as the Father, through All as the Son,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and in All as the Spirit, Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Fullness of His Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to All the Members of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ultimately, in Ephesians 4:6 there is "one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God the Father is in three situations: He is over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Over all" indicates that He is the overshadowing One, covering us and taking care of us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Through all" means that He knows our situation intimately because He has passed through all of the things regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are a manager of a company, you must go through all of the offices and rooms of your company in order to know what is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"In all" means that He stays within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the Triune God is in three situations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Over all" refers to the Father, "through all" refers to the Son, and "in all" refers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father functions as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, this One is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These Three are one in reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divine dispensing comes out of the Three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The divine dispensing taking place within us is the operating of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as the aggregate, totality, and consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Spirit is moving in us, anointing us, watering us, feeding us, satisfying us, strengthening us, comforting us, saturating us, and permeating us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are so many words to describe His dispensing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of the foregoing items, such as watering, feeding, strengthening, permeating, saturating, and anointing, are matters of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every day we should be built up by receiving the divine dispensing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not expect to have a spectacular time each day in receiving the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I recently spoke a word to the trainees in the full-time training concerning their daily spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I told them not to expect to have a spectacular result in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should forget about having something spectacular.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn to be satisfied with ordinary days which are filled with regular and normal practices in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the morning we should have some time with the Lord to touch Him and be revived by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we need to pass through a daily routine to get ready for work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To live a life in the divine dispensing in a normal way will make us healthy both physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not we have good or bad days is not up to us; it is up to His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has already chosen us, and it is too late to turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are blessed because the processed and consummated Triune God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is in us, not in a spectacular way but in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be blessed to be satisfied with ordinary days in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Triune God is certainly in us, but His being in us is not spectacular.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day He is within us dispensing and positively strengthening and encouraging us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the last three years, I have experienced many troubles, yet nothing has disturbed me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have published more messages, I have visited more places, and I have held more conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, this is not because I have had spectacular days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have just lived an ordinary life of receiving His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Epistles reveal that the work of Christ within us is a fine work of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I cannot tell you how much the fine dispensing has been going on within me during these last three years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our destiny is to live an ordinary life in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Father God has destined that we live in an ordinary way under His continual dispensing.</S>
