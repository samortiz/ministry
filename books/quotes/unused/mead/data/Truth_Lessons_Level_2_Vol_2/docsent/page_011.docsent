   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENOCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From Enosh, the third generation from Adam, to Enoch, the seventh generation from Adam, there were no outstanding persons who could serve as spiritual representatives or signs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, in terms of spiritual representation and significance, Enoch was the continuation of Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Enosh called upon the name of Jehovah and enjoyed the riches of God; Enoch, in the spiritual sense, carried on from Enosh and went a step further to walk with God, and was taken by God so that he escaped the ultimate issue of man s fall, that is, death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Walking with God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he begot a son, whom he named Methuselah, which means when he is dead it the judgment of the flood shall be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The significance of this name corresponds with Enoch s prophecy: Behold, the Lord came...to execute judgment against all Jude 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This certainly indicates that he must have known, through God s revelation, that one day the Lord would come to judge that ungodly and unrighteous generation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, when he begot Methuselah, he gave him such a name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has been calculated that when Noah was six hundred years of age, at the time when the flood came to judge that evil age Gen 5:25-29; 7:6 , Methuselah was nine hundred and sixty-nine years old, the age at which he died.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Enoch must have been warned concerning this, and, fearing God, he began to walk with God, that is, to live and move with God, taking God as his center and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Enoch s walking with God must have been due to his believing in God and his seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Hebrews 11:6, Enoch believed not only that God is, but that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that Enoch not only believed that there is a God, that is, that God exists, and that He is real, living, and present, but he also believed that God is a rewarder who will reward those who seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, Enoch believed in God, sought Him out, and walked with Him for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This satisfied and pleased God, and as a result God rewarded him with Himself as the eternal life and enabled him to escape death and to be taken by God so that he did not have to see death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Being Taken by God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Enoch s being taken by God meant that he was taken out of that evil age, which was ungodly and unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only was he exempted from suffering the judgment of the catastrophe concerning which he prophesied, but he even did not have to see the death that all fallen men must pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death is the ultimate destiny of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not only those who forsake God s way of redemption and life and take the way of death who must die; even those who take the way of God s redemption and life, and who live according to God s revelation and for God s will, are subject to death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Enoch found the way to escape death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By walking with God for three hundred years, fully enjoying God s salvation, he lived a life that enabled him to escape the power of death, to overcome the destruction of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, God took him away, separating him from death so that he did not see death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is God s ultimate salvation, the ultimate consummation of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Becoming the Representative</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of All the Overcomers Who Will Be Raptured</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While They Are Living</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Enoch walked with God and was taken by God while he was living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, he also is a model, representing all the overcomers who will be raptured while they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that all who take God s way of redemption and life by calling on Him, enjoying His riches, and walking and living with Him can receive grace to such an extent that they will not see death John 8:51; 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Elijah, the overcoming prophet in the Old Testament, was raptured while he was living 2 Kings 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the future, when the Lord returns, the overcoming believers, because they live soberly and watchfully, will be raptured while they are living, not having to see death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus they will escape the great tribulation that is coming upon the whole earth Matt 24:21; Luke 21:34-35; 1 Thes 5:3 and will be taken up to Mount Zion Rev 14:1 , where the Lord Jesus has been since the time of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There they will walk, live, and be with Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these items are represented by Enoch s walking with God and being taken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Enosh means frail man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In giving his son this name, Seth must have sensed the extreme fragility, impotence, and complete helplessness of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Enosh must have inherited the same realization and sense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because Seth sensed his own fragility and impotence, he must have begun to call on the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Enosh was born of such a father, one who called on the name of Jehovah, he inherited this blessing naturally and became one who called on the name of Jehovah and thus enjoyed God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, he became a model representing all those who call on the name of Jehovah and enjoy the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the spiritual sense, Enoch carried on from Enosh and took a further step to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he begot Methuselah, he received the revelation from God that one day the Lord would come to judge that ungodly and unrighteous generation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, he was warned and, fearing God, he began to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He also believed that God is a rewarder who will reward those who seek Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, God rewarded Enoch with Himself as the eternal life and enabled him to escape death, to be taken by Him, and to not see death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus Enoch also became a model, representing all the overcomers who will be raptured while they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>QUESTIONS Why did Seth name his son Enosh?</S>
