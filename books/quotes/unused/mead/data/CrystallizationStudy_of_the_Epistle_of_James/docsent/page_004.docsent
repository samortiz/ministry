   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To endure trials James says that we need faith.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James 1:13-18 points out that we need to resist the temptation which draws the believers away and entices the believers by their own lusts by all good giving and every perfect gift from the Father of lights and by the virtue of being begotten by God with the word of truth to be the firstfruits of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These three points are very good: the begetting of God, the word of truth, and the firstfruits of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We resist the temptation by God's good giving and gifts and by the virtue of God's regeneration, which is with the word of truth to produce the firstfruits of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can resist temptations only as a regenerated man, not as a natural man.</S>
