Although the messages did not form a series, every one of them was an exposition of scriptural passages and not a free talk.</P><P>This magazine was comparatively simple in nature. It was published for young believers-those who are young spiritually. It sometimes contained news with reports on the work of the brothers in Shanghai and elsewhere.</P><P>The magazine was published twice a month, beginning in April 1930 and ending in June 1934. There were a total of fifty issues. We have published them in three volumes. Issue Nos. 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 are missing. Issue No. 27, entitled "Who Can Draw Near to God," was given by Brother Meek and is not included in this work. Four additional messages, "Forgiveness and Confession," "The Power of Resurrection," "A Noble Deed," and "The Pathway to Glory-Through Jerusalem" are, according to reliable sources, articles that were published in this magazine and are included in this series. The fourth message in the series on "The Rapture and the Tribulation," was printed in The Christian (Resumed) and not part of these fifty issues of Notes on Scriptural Messages. Nevertheless, it is a continuation of the last few messages of this magazine and, as such, is included in this series.</P><P>Some of these articles appeared later in the series Twelve Baskets Full in twelve volumes.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PASSOVER</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given in Shanghai on June 6, 1930)<br>Issue No. 4</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 5:7-8</H1><P>First Corinthians 5:7-8 clearly refers to a story in the Old Testament, that of the Passover recorded in Exodus 12. The explanation here shows us three things: (1) that the slain lamb of the Passover is Christ; (2) that the leaven is malice and evil; and (3) that since our Lamb, who is Christ, has been slain, we should also keep this feast before Christ. Now, according to the record of Exodus, let us consider the story of the Passover portion by portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VERDICT OF DEATH<br>(EXODUS 11:4-5)</H2><P>"And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts."</P><P>The verdict is that all the firstborn ones, the eldest ones, have to die. What is the meaning of the firstborn and the eldest one? We can read 1 Corinthians 15:46, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual." Everything that is of Adam, that is begotten of Adam, is the eldest and firstborn, and God's verdict for it is "death"!</P><P>Romans 5:12 says, "Death passed on to all men." Hebrews 9:27 says, "And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once." No one can escape this death! First Corinthians 15:22 says, "For just as in Adam all die." Hence, my friends, we are all destined to die. No one can escape death. Everyone has to die. This is God's verdict. All the firstborn ones, the eldest ones, have to die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A DIFFERENCE BEING MADE<br>WITH RESPECT TO DEATH<br>(EXODUS 11:7)</H2><P>"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel."</P><P>God chose a special group of people, the Israelites. He chose a group of people who would not have to pass through death to be His people. He is likewise choosing a group of people from the world who will not have to pass through death. God has put a difference between the Egyptians and the Israelites, so that the latter do not have to die. Ephesians 1:4 says, "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world." What good news! Among all the dead ones, God is choosing a group of people whom He will deliver from death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S WAY OF DELIVERANCE<br>(EXODUS 12:1-4)</H2><P>"And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house: and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb."</P><P>What was the way God used to deliver men from death? In the former days, it was with a lamb. Now God has given us Christ. In the whole world, the word lamb is applied to only one person, Christ. The title the Son of Man was used by both Daniel and Ezekiel. But from Genesis to Revelation, only Christ is ever called the Lamb. John 1:29 says that He is "the Lamb of God." First Peter 1:19 says that His precious blood is the blood "of a Lamb without blemish and without spot." Revelation 13:8 says that He is "the Lamb who was slain." Everywhere in the Bible, Christ is considered as the Lamb. In the old days, the Israelites were saved by the lamb. Now, men are saved by Christ.</P><P>Why did God want them to consider this month as the first month and the beginning of the year? There is a profound significance here. He would not consider the eighth month, the ninth month, the second month, or the fourth month. He would not consider all the other months of the year, but He would consider only this month as the first month and the beginning of the year. This tells us that for an unsaved person all the years he spends when he is unsaved are not counted. No matter if he is forty or fifty years old, as long as he is not saved, his days are not counted before God. All these years are wasted in vanity! God considers this month as the beginning of the year. As soon as a person is saved, he has his first month. The day that we receive the life of God is the first day of our year. In the parable of the vineyard in Matthew 20, everyone who has not entered the vineyard for the work is to the master of the vineyard an "idle" person. This does not mean that all these people are doing nothing. But to the master of the vineyard, they are "idle." The same is true with all unsaved persons in the eyes of God.</P><P>"In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb." This is the beginning of the Passover. The Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem on this day. He went to Bethany six days before the Passover, which was the ninth day of the first month (John 12:1). The next day, which was the tenth day of the first month, He entered Jerusalem (John 12:12). From that day on, the betrayer Judas sought for opportunity to deliver Him up to men (Matt. 26:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE LAMB<br>(EXODUS 12:5; 13:2)</H2><P>"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats."</P><P>"Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine." </P><P>The most important qualification of the lamb is to be without blemish. To be without blemish is to be without sin. The reason no one in the world can be our savior is that everyone has sinned. You have sinned, and I have sinned. This is why you cannot save me. You should die, and I should die. Therefore, you cannot save me. The Lord Jesus is truly the One without blemish! He said of Himself, "Which of you convicts Me of sin?" (John 8:46). Throughout history, only Jesus could say this. For two thousand years, men would only say that the Lord Jesus was too good for not resisting others; no one would say that He was too evil. Hebrews 7:26 says that He is "separated from sinners"!</P><P>The second point is that this lamb must be a firstborn lamb. God kills the firstborn ones. This is why He has to save the firstborn with the firstborn. The Lord Jesus is the firstborn son (Luke 2:7). He is indeed a Savior without blemish! (1 Pet. 1:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE DEATH OF THE LAMB<br>(EXODUS 12:6)</H2><P>"And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."</P><P>This is the most crucial point! We sinners need a savior to save us! But if the Lord had not died, we would still perish even if we had seen and heard Him face to face in His days. Even if we were able to see and hear Him face to face today, we would still be under woe, for the wages of sin is death. He has to die before He can save us from death.</P><P>The Lamb has to be kept "until the fourteenth day of the same month" and killed "in the evening." In the same way, the Lord was killed on the fourteenth day of the first month. Even the hour was not missed. Matthew 27:45 says, "Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour." "In the evening" means to be between two nights; this is a Jewish expression. The famous Jewish historian Josephus said that the "evening" is the sixth hour to the ninth hour, which on our clock would be from noon to three o'clock. The Lord was crucified during this time. The sky became dark during this time until He expired.</P><P>Who killed the Lamb? It was the whole congregation of Israel that killed Him. Here is a great type: the priest typifies the church, the twelve tribes typify the nations on earth, and the congregation typifies mankind as a whole.</P><P>At the time of Noah, the world was divided into three tribes: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. On the day of the Lord's crucifixion, there were the Jews, of Shem; the Romans, of Japheth; and Simon the Cyrenian, of Ham. The whole of mankind was there. The Lord made the testimony before all mankind that He had died!</P><P>At the time of Caesar Nero, the census recorded that there were over three million people living in Jerusalem. The Lord's death was before so many people.</P><P>"Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" (Exo. 12:46). The Lord Jesus indeed fulfilled this. John 19:36 says, "For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: `No bone of His shall be broken.'" Here is a most amazing thing. How could the Lord become a Passover lamb? According to the record of the Talmud, forty years before the destruction of the temple, that is, one year before the crucifixion of the Lord, the Roman Emperor set a decree that forbade stoning people to death. When someone is stoned to death, his bones are broken. The Jews executed men by the way of stoning, while the Romans executed men by crucifixion. When Pilate ordered the Jews to examine the Lord according to their own law, the Jews said that they did not have the power to kill anyone (John 18:31). This is another proof. The Lord prophesied that He would be crucified and not stoned to death. Otherwise, He would not be able to become the Passover lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE STRIKING OF THE BLOOD<br>(EXODUS 12:7, 22-23)</H2><P>"And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it."</P><P>"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you."</P><P>The most important point is the striking of the blood. The Lord has died. But why is it that so many sinners are still perishing? There is only one reason; they have not struck the blood.</P><P>How do we strike the blood? The blood is to be struck on the lintel and on the two side posts and is to remain in the basin. This means there is blood on top, below, and on the two sides. The cross reaches all four directions; it reaches the top, the bottom, the left, and the right.</P><P>One can be saved only by passing through the blood. One can look up to heaven only by passing through the blood.</P><P>"Hyssop" is the smallest of all plants (1 Kings 4:33). The New Testament also mentions one thing as being the smallest, the mustard seed. The mustard seed symbolizes our faith. The blood must be applied with the hyssop. The blood must be received by faith. Although the faith is small, we have to strike the blood with this small and tiny hyssop.</P><P>What does God say about the blood? He said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (Exo. 12:13). This is a very important word. The "I" here is God Himself. The meaning of Passover is that God passes over us when He sees the blood. The one who strikes the blood does not see the blood; it is God who sees the blood. You do not have to see the value of the blood. You are inside the door, and the blood is outside the door. The blood is not for you to see. God does not need you to see the blood. You only need to exercise your faith. Although you may not feel it or see it, you only need to believe. The important thing is for the blood to be applied. If the blood is applied, there is no need to worry.</P><P>Once Mr. Moody was preaching to a man. He told the man that if he would believe in the Lord Jesus, he would be saved. But that man continued to fear that he would still perish after he had believed. The two spoke for a long time. When they were about to part, Mr. Moody said to the man, "Imagine this: At the time of the flood, when Noah and his household of eight were in the ark, would they have trembled for fear that the ark would sink? If they had done this, it would have been the most foolish thing to do." He went on saying, "You are such a person." That man immediately understood and went away in joy.</P><P>It is God who saw the blood; the firstborn did not see the blood. When God sees the blood, He passes over us. He does not pass over us because we are good. Salvation depends on whether or not we have believed in Christ. When God sees the blood, He passes over us. No matter how good we are, even if we are as good as Christ, without the blood, God's ordination is that we should die. Because the Lamb died, we do not have to die anymore. If the Lamb had not died, we would have to die. It does not matter how good we are. As long as we do not believe in the blood, we cannot be saved. God does not consider if we are good or bad; He only considers the blood of the Lamb. Other than the blood, nothing can save us.</P><P>The blood is placed between God and man. We are sinners and must die. If we do not want to die, we have to remove death. How do we remove death? It is by the Lamb's dying for us. In this way we do not have to die anymore. A man can only die once; he cannot die twice. Death only visits men once; it does not visit men twice. If I have died once, death will not come to me anymore.</P><P>Either the lamb had to die, or the sons had to die. Either Christ has to die, or you have to die. Your sins have consummated in one death, the death of Christ. This is salvation! The basis of salvation is Christ's death for us. Let us look unto Him!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PASSOVER</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given in Shanghai on June 20, 1930)<br>Issue No. 5</H2><P>Through the blood of Jesus Christ, we are saved. But now we have a problem. As believers, we are like newborn babes. Sometimes we are well, and sometimes we are not well. Sometimes we rise, and sometimes we fall. What is the reason for this? Does it mean that salvation is not complete? No, it is simply that we have only done the first half-the striking of the blood. There is still a second half, which we have not followed through with immediately. The result is that we still become weak and fail. This second half of the work should be done once the blood has been applied. Now let us consider this second half of the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. EATING THE FLESH OF THE LAMB THE SAME NIGHT<br>(EXODUS 12:8)</H2><P>"In that night" means on the night the blood was struck. After the blood is struck, one should go on to eat the flesh of the lamb. The blood was struck on the lintel and the side posts; this is outward. The eating is to take care of the inward need. The blood of the Lord is objective, while the eating of the flesh is subjective. The striking of the blood is for God to see, while the eating of the flesh is for the nourishment of one's own body. Because the blood has been struck, God passes over us. At the same time, God has given the Lord Jesus to us to eat. In this way we are strengthened.</P><P>Salvation, on the one hand, satisfies God, and on the other hand, changes us. Striking the blood satisfies God, while eating the flesh changes us. The blood has been struck, but I have to ask whether you have eaten the flesh yet. What is the meaning of the flesh being in the stomach? It means that it has been digested and has become you; it has become your flesh and your bone. If you have only struck the blood outside, but have not eaten the flesh of the lamb, you will not see much change in your life, and you will remain too weak and powerless to be a victorious believer. You must eat the flesh of the lamb the same night that you strike the blood.</P><P>Today there is one mistake which men make in preaching the gospel. They preach only one side of the story. Christ's work is of two sides. On the one hand, He works outside of us so that God may be pleased with us. On the other hand, He works inside of us so that we may be satisfied in life. Today men pay attention only to Christ's dying for them and neglect His being life to them. We exhort men only to believe that His blood was shed for them; we seldom exhort men to receive Him into their heart to be their inward Savior and deliver them from all the inward sins and weaknesses. Hence, our result reflects our preaching-we gain many believers who are correct in their faith but who are weak in life and who are fluctuating all the time.</P><P>The people had to eat the flesh of the lamb, for the next day they had to move and make their journey. How long a journey did they have to make? They had to make the long journey from Egypt to Canaan. Today we have to be well fed before we can have the strength to make our journey. Why is it that many people are not making the wilderness journey? It is because they have not yet been fed.</P><P>Striking the blood is for God's satisfaction. However, if you do not eat the flesh of the lamb, you will not have satisfaction because you have not yet received Christ as your life. Since you have received Jesus as your Savior, you also have to receive Him as Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE WAY TO EAT THE LAMB<br>(EXODUS 12:8-10)</H2><P>"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."</P><P>"Roast with fire." Fire signifies the Holy Spirit or God's love. The flesh must be roasted with fire. This means that we cannot use our natural strength to receive Christ as our life; neither can we use any human methods. We have to receive Christ as our life through the Holy Spirit. John 6:51 says, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world." Verse 63 says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." We should pay attention to the fact that John 6:51-59 is on the bread of life; it is on the question of life. After the disciples heard these words, they could not understand. Some thought about giving up their discipleship. For this reason the Lord told them that "the flesh profits nothing."</P><P>It is true that we need to eat, but what is the way to eat? The disciples were trying to eat the flesh raw. Hence, the Lord told them that they have to roast it with fire. Fire is the Spirit in John 6:63. When we receive Him as Savior, we have eternal life, but we must also receive Him as Lord before we can have eternal victory.</P><P>"And unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it." Leaven refers to sin. To be unleavened is to remove all sins. Every person who has received Jesus as his Savior, according to the Bible, has to eat the flesh the same night. Some of us are abnormal and subnormal Christians because although we are saved, we wait a long time before we receive Him as our Lord! However, the Bible says that the night the blood was struck, they ate the flesh of the lamb. In other words, the same night that the blood was struck they removed sin.</P><P>Christ gives to us two gifts. One is justification, and the other is sanctification. We may only want to have one of them, but Christ will not give us one only. If we do not remove our sins, we cannot obtain God's forgiveness. If we do not hate our sins and desire holiness, Christ cannot justify us. We must strike the blood and also eat the flesh. But at the same time, we must have the unleavened bread; we must hate sin. If any man eats the flesh with leavened bread, this man has not applied the blood yet; he is still unsaved. It is true that a Christian can afterward sin or crave sin, but if he has never once hated sin since the day he believed in Jesus as his Savior, he must not be saved yet.</P><P>The "bitter herbs," according to the original language, do not refer to any herbs in particular; they merely refer to any herbs that are bitter. The bitter herbs imply a contrite heart. If a person wants to be saved yet does not hate sin, he cannot eat the flesh, for he does not have a contrite heart. Second Corinthians 7:10-11 says, "For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret...For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter." These are the bitter herbs. The bitter herbs mean that one rebukes and hates himself. God will not despise a contrite and repentant heart.</P><P>"Eat not of it raw." To eat it raw means to eat according to natural strength. One must not eat the flesh of the lamb raw, which means that it is futile to hold onto Christ with natural strength.</P><P>"Nor sodden at all with water." To be sodden with water is to use human methods. The flesh of the lamb cannot be sodden with water. This means that it is futile to hold onto Christ with human methods.</P><P>"And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire." This means that by the next morning one can no longer eat it even if he wished to. What is the meaning of morning? Morning is the time of resurrection; it is the time when one truly leaves Egypt, the time of rapture from Egypt. Hence, to eat the flesh of the lamb, one must do so before the morning. After that, if anyone wanted to eat the flesh of the Lamb and receive Jesus as his Lord and his life, it would be too late.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE ATTITUDE WHILE EATING THE LAMB<br>(EXODUS 12:11)</H2><P>"And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover."</P><P>The previous passage tells us how to eat; this verse tells us what one should do besides eating. "With your loins girded." The Jewish dress is loose and has no buttons. When one is walking around casually, he does not gird himself up, but when he works, he will have to gird up his loins. From Luke 17:8, 12:35, and Acts 12:8, we can see the meaning of girded loins. To gird the loins means to be ready to work.</P><P>"Your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand." The purpose of this is to prepare oneself to take the journey. Once the Israelites were filled in their stomachs, they had to leave Egypt immediately to take their sojourning way. Once the blood is struck and the flesh eaten, one becomes a sojourner, and he has to leave Egypt immediately. Our life is the life of a sojourner; therefore, we have to be ready to leave Egypt. Once we have struck the blood and eaten the flesh, God will not allow us to remain in Egypt anymore.</P><P>"Your shoes on your feet." According to Ephesians 6:15, which says, "And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace," we know that to put on the shoes means to be prepared to journey. In Acts 12 the angels told Peter to tie on his sandals because he was about to take a journey. The Jews did not wear shoes when they were at home; they only put on their shoes when they were ready to walk outside. To walk is to take up our sojourning.</P><P>"Your staff." According to Genesis 32:10, which says, "With my staff I passed over this Jordan," we see that the staff is for traveling outdoors. Hebrews 11:21 says, "By faith Jacob, while he was dying...worshipped God, while leaning on the top of his staff." God paid attention to Jacob's staff. Whether in his going out, on his return, or during his time in Egypt, Jacob never gave up his staff. This means that his whole life was a life of sojourning. This is why God was pleased with him. Henceforth, we should live a sojourning life; we should no longer live in the world. Once the Israelites struck the blood and ate the flesh, they left Egypt. Let me ask, are we still living on this earth? Which book of the Bible mentions the expression living on earth the most? It is the book of Revelation. Those who live on the earth are those who live in Egypt, not only physically but spiritually as well. Do we have a staff in our hand? Is our hope in Egypt, or is it to cross the wilderness to enter Canaan? The world, the place where we are, should only be a way to pass by while we live and a grave to us after we die. It should bear no relationship to us other than being our way and our grave.</P><P>If we dwell in the world, we will not be able to reign with Christ; we will have no share in the millennium. Philippians 3 says that our commonwealth exists in the heavens, while 1 Peter 2 says that we are strangers and sojourners. Our government, homeland, and inheritance are not here. If we think these things are here, we are mistaken. Why did the Israelites think of Egypt when they were already journeying in the wilderness? They had forgotten Pharaoh's oppression. They remembered the leeks and garlic and all the other food. We were under Satan's oppression. But sometimes we think back on the little favors he gave us and what we were like before we were saved. Oh, if God left us in Egypt, what would have become of us? We would not have been any better than we are now!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE FEAST OF THE UNLEAVENED BREAD<br>(EXODUS 12:15-20)</H2><P>"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel...Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread."</P><P>This matter is somewhat serious! A believer has to remove the leaven. Leaven is the yeast for the flour dough; it is what makes a dough rise. The Bible tells us that from the day we eat the Passover lamb, we have to remove all leaven, and we have to eat unleavened bread for seven days.</P><P>What is the meaning of leaven? It is malice and evil. To be unleavened is to be sincere and without sin (1 Cor. 5:8).</P><P>To strike the blood is to be justified, saved, and delivered from the harm of the Egyptians. To remove the leaven is to be sanctified and have a share among God's people. The striking of blood is Christ's work, while the removing of the leaven is what every saved person should do. It is something that we should do daily from the first coming of the Lord until His second coming. We have to remove the leaven for seven days.</P><P>Without striking the blood, one cannot be saved even if the leaven is removed. If one strikes the blood but does not remove the leaven, he cannot be sanctified either. It is very pitiful that today many Christians have struck the blood, but few have removed the leaven!</P><P>It is said that during one Jewish Passover a carpenter examined carefully every item when the Feast of Unleavened Bread was approaching. Every place was cleansed and readied for the feast. On the night of the feast, he suddenly discovered that one of the sacks had molded bread. He dared not touch it even with his hands, but had to lift it up with two sticks and throw it into the fire. He had to keep this feast with such reverence. Brothers and sisters, how much time have we spent in dealing with sins?</P><P>If the leaven is not removed, there will surely be losses. All those who will not remove their leaven will be cut off from Israel. Please note that they are to be cut off from Israel; they are not to perish with the Egyptians in Egypt. They are driven from the people of God and are not punished with perdition together with those in the world. Without removing the leaven, one cannot fellowship with God's people. We should note that they are cut off from the congregation of the Israelites. Without striking the blood, there is no salvation. Without removing the leaven, one cannot meet together with the people of God. One becomes separated from the holy people of God and will not be able to enter Canaan with them.</P><P>If one does not remove the leaven, he will not perish in Egypt, but he will have no share in the millennium (Canaan). Striking the blood gives one eternal life, while  removing the leaven gives one the kingdom. Once a person is saved, he cannot perish anymore. However, if he does not remove the leaven, he will not be able to reign with the Lord. Based on what can we say this?</P><P>Removing the leaven in 1 Corinthians 5 is done by removing the evil man from among them (v. 13). This means that we should remove the sinning ones from the church of God, as one would remove leaven from the dough of flour. What are the sins that warrant a removing? They are the ones mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5:11: "A fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man." Those who are involved with these six kinds of sins are the ones to be removed. This is the meaning of being cut off from the congregation of Israel in Exodus 12.</P><P>What will those who are involved with these six kinds of sins suffer? First Corinthians 6:9-10 says, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God." From this we see that those who are cut off from the church in chapter five will be cut off from the kingdom of God. A legal cutting off is one which is a cutting off from the millennium. To be cut off from the congregation of Israel is to be cut off from Canaan. Canaan is not a type of heaven but a type of the kingdom.</P><P>Although there were many Israelites who left Egypt, only four entered Canaan! Two of them were living-Joshua and Caleb, while two of them were dead-Jacob and Joseph. This signifies that some are raptured alive, while some are resurrected from the dead. Oh, there are indeed many today who are saved through the striking of the blood. But how many will enter the kingdom through the removing of the leaven?</P><P>Brothers and sisters, the Passover is to lead us to the Feast of Unleavened Bread. After striking the blood, there must also be the removing of leaven. One has to trust in the blood and also in the work of the Holy Spirit. We cannot be too passive concerning the blood, and we cannot be too active concerning the leaven. Since we are saved through the blood apart from our work, we should now strive to remove the leaven and pursue holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI.

Hence, everyone who is purchased by the blood belongs to God. We are purchased by Him and do not have our own freedom. How many of us can say, "God, I belong to You. I am Your slave"? "For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body" (1 Cor. 6:20). The day that a person is saved is the day that he is sold. A slave is bought with a price, while a servant is hired with money. Those who are sold do not have any freedom of their own, while those who are hired still have their own freedom. We are God's slaves; we are not His servants. Every time the Bible mentions this matter, in the original language, the word slave is used. We are slaves purchased by God.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting in Shanghai<br>on July 4, 1930)<br>Issue No. 6</H2><P>The question we wish to bring up today is one to which many, as far as I know, have not paid attention. It is the matter of the salvation of the soul. Concerning salvation, we should emphasize very much that there is a great difference between the spirit and the soul. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "Your spirit and soul and body." This word clearly divides man into three parts. Simply put, the spirit is the part of man which fellowships with God. Lower animals do not have this; therefore, lower animals cannot worship God. The soul is the organ of man's thought, will, and emotion. Lower animals also have this part. The soul is just the life we have as an animal. The body is the part of man which communicates with the material world. Man is of three parts, spirit and soul and body; therefore, the meaning of salvation is that all three parts have to be saved.</P><P>First Corinthians 5:5 says, "His spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord." This speaks of the salvation of the spirit. Romans 8:23 says, "The redemption of our body." This speaks of the salvation of the body. Today we wish to examine the salvation of the soul. We will look carefully into every place in the New Testament where the salvation of the soul is mentioned so that we may understand what the salvation of the soul is, and what its significance is.</P><P>Matthew 16:24-28 says, "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life? For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings. Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</P><P>"Then Jesus said to his disciples." From this word, we know that the Lord Jesus spoke the following words to his disciples, not to outsiders. Since they were the disciples, they were saved people. Therefore, we should remember that the following words were spoken to saints who were already saved, not to sinners who were not saved.</P><P>"If anyone wants to come after Me." "Anyone" means anyone among the saved ones who will come after the Lord. "Anyone" still refers to the saved disciples, those who particularly want to follow the Lord. The words "come after Me" indicate that the words which follow are the conditions of coming after the Lord.</P><P>"Let him deny himself." To deny the self does not mean to conquer the self. It does not mean to ignore oneself or renounce one's rights. To deny the self means to not follow one's own mind in everything and not consider oneself the center. It means putting oneself aside and seeking God's mind. The Lord says that only this kind of person can come after Him. This is very obvious because in order to follow the Lord, one surely cannot follow himself.</P><P>"Take up his cross and follow Me." This is even deeper than denying oneself. To deny oneself is to forget about oneself, but to take up the cross is to submit to God. To take up the cross is accepting all that God has arranged and being willing to suffer according to God's will. If we deny the self and take up the cross, we will be able to follow the Lord.</P><P>"For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." The word "life" is psuche in the original text, which means "soul." This verse speaks of the matter of saving one's soul and losing one's soul. This sheds light on the question we are about to examine.</P><P>"For." This is a continuation of what was said before. The word "for" shows us that the denying of the self and the taking up of the cross to follow the Lord in the last verse is the same thing as saving and losing of the soul spoken of here.</P><P>"For whoever wants to save his soul-life." This means that though a person wants to follow the Lord, he is not willing to deny himself or take up the cross. From this, we can understand to some extent the meaning of saving one's soul. It means to be unable to disregard oneself or renounce one's rights; it means to be unable to allow oneself to suffer and submit to God. This word shows us that saving the soul is opposite to denying the self and taking up the cross. Therefore, if a man understands what it is to deny the self and take up the cross, he understands what it is to save the soul.</P><P>The Lord tells us that if a man cares for himself so much and is unwilling to deny himself, take up the cross, suffer, or submit to God, the ultimate end of saving his soul will be losing his soul. Losing the soul means to suffer ultimately, losing what one delights in and failing to receive what pleases him.</P><P>"Whoever loses his soul-life for My sake." This is the denying of the self and taking up of the cross spoken of above. To lose the soul means the same as denying the self. The Lord reckons that if a man is willing to forsake all the pleasures of the soul for His sake and suffer according to God's will, he "shall find" his soul. This means that whoever is willing for the Lord's sake to forsake his own mind and what he takes pleasure in, to prohibit his heart from finding satisfaction in the things of the world, and to endure much pain and suffering, the Lord will cause him to gain what his heart takes pleasure in, obtain satisfaction, enjoy blessing, and become happy at another time.</P><P>After reading the above verse, we know what the meaning of the salvation of the soul is. This verse shows us that salvation of the soul means to make the soul happy, to follow what the heart desires, and to gain satisfaction. Losing the soul means to deprive the self of happiness, not following what the heart desires, and not having satisfaction.</P><P>Hence, to lose the soul is definitely not what we usually refer to as perdition. The Lord Jesus shows us that saving the soul means to be unwilling to deny the self or take up the cross, and losing the soul means to be willing to deny the self and take up the cross. It is obvious that this is not related to what we commonly know as salvation or perdition. If saving the soul means gaining eternal life, why does the Lord Jesus say that one should lose the soul for His sake? If losing the soul means going to the lake of fire, is it conceivable that the Lord Jesus wants us to go to the lake of fire for His sake when He told us to lose our soul? Therefore, this verse does not refer in the slightest to the matter of gaining eternal life and going to the lake of fire. Losing the soul in the first part of the verse must mean the same as losing the soul in the second part of the verse. If we take "whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it" to mean that whoever does not deny himself shall go to the lake of fire, then the next part "whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it" would have to mean that whoever goes to the lake of fire for His sake shall find eternal life. This is absurd. Therefore, the meaning is simply that if a saved Christian will not let his soul (all his senses) suffer, his soul will certainly suffer in the future. If he is willing to let his soul suffer for the Lord's sake, in the future his soul will certainly not suffer.</P><P>Moreover, if saving the soul means gaining eternal life and losing the soul means going to the lake of fire, what the Lord Jesus says here is not connected to what went before. This word was spoken to the disciples who had eternal life already. Furthermore, a non-Christian could never deny himself, take up the cross, or follow the Lord. If the Lord wanted them to gain eternal life, the Lord would certainly have told them to believe; He would definitely not have told them to deny the self in order to gain eternal life. Only one who has already gained eternal life possesses the possibility of denying the self, taking up the cross, and following the Lord. What a sinner, who is without eternal life, should do is not follow the Lord, but believe in Him so that he can gain eternal life.</P><P>"For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?" Our Lord continues to speak of the unprofitability of a man losing his soul through saving it. He means that if a man does not deny himself, take up the cross, and closely follow Him, but acts according to the pleasure of his soul in order to give satisfaction to his soul, even to the extent of gaining the whole world, a time will come when he will lose his soul. A momentary saving of the soul with the result of losing it in the end is unprofitable in the Lord's eyes. Although a man can gain much happiness through going after his own desires, the Lord says that in the end he will lose his soul and lose all happiness. According to the Lord, gaining the soul at the end is much better than gaining the soul at the beginning. He says that there is nothing a man can exchange for the satisfaction of the soul at the end. This means that a man should lose his soul beforehand rather than to lose it at the end.</P><P>The Lord tells us that whoever will save his soul will lose it. At what time will he lose it? If a man saves his soul now, when will he lose it? The Lord says that whoever loses his soul for His sake will find it. When will this be? To answer this question, He goes on, "For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</P><P>"His doings" means his deeds in this life. "His doings" can be divided into two aspects: the saving of one's soul in this life and the losing of one's soul for the Lord's sake in this life. To "repay each man according to his doings" is to cause those who save their soul to lose it and to cause those who lose their soul for the Lord's sake to find it. According to the Lord's word, when will he who saves his soul lose it, and when will he who loses his soul for the Lord's sake find it? He says that it will be at the time of His coming. Therefore, we need to see clearly that if a man cares for himself now, makes himself happy, and is not willing to suffer for the Lord, at the Lord's coming, he will be rebuked by the Lord, not obtain the Lord's glory, and may even weep and gnash his teeth. If a man is willing to forsake his rights now, be totally separated from the world, and faithfully submit to the will of God, at the time of the Lord's coming he will win the praise of the Lord, enjoy the joy of the Lord, and be fully satisfied in his heart and mind.</P><P>The Lord's coming and His repaying particularly refer to His kingship in the kingdom because after the Lord tells us of His coming, He tells us where His coming is. Verse 28 says, "The Son of Man coming in His kingdom." Therefore, the Lord means that when He comes to earth to be king for a thousand years, some shall reign with Him, but some shall not.</P><P>The main point of this portion of the Word is that there are two kinds of disciples who have believed in the Lord and have eternal life. One kind denies the self and takes up the cross; the other kind is not willing to deny the self and take up the cross. The latter, seeking to gain the pleasures of the world for the self, are not willing to lose the soul; the former are willing to forsake all and lose their soul for the Lord's sake. A disciple is a person set apart from the sinners. But the Lord sets the self-denying disciples apart from the non-self-denying disciples. We should know that our future position in the kingdom will be determined by our deeds today. What is gained today is the same in nature as what will be gained in the future. What is lost today is also the same in nature as what will be lost in the future. If today's gain means gaining the world and the denial of suffering, then the future's gain must be the gaining of the world and freedom from suffering. If today's loss means forsaking the world and the denial of one's own will, then the future's loss must also be losing the world and the non-fulfillment of one's own will. The Lord means that whoever receives full satisfaction from the world now will lose his reigning position with the Lord in the future. From this we see that the salvation of the soul is very different from what we usually refer to as the salvation of the spirit (which means the salvation of gaining eternal life).</P><P>How is the spirit saved? "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:6). John 3 tells us that "he who believes...has eternal life" (v. 36). Once a man believes, his spirit is saved. Hence, saving the spirit means gaining eternal life. How is the soul saved? This portion of the Word tells us that only when a man loses his soul for the Lord's sake can his soul be saved. The salvation of the spirit is the gaining of eternal life, while the salvation of the soul is the gaining of the kingdom.</P><P>My spirit is saved by Jesus bearing the cross for me, whereas my soul is saved through my bearing of the cross.</P><P>The spirit is saved because Jesus denied Himself for me, while the soul is saved by my denying of my self and following the Lord.</P><P>The salvation of the spirit is based on believing. Once a man believes, the matter is settled forever and cannot be shaken. The salvation of the soul depends upon a life-long matter and a journey which has been completed.</P><P>The salvation of the spirit is based on faith because "he who believes...has eternal life" (John 3:36). The salvation of the soul is based on deeds because "He will repay each man according to his doings" (Matt. 16:27). Even if all the demons rise up from hell to confound me, they cannot make me perish, and even if all the angels come down from heaven to smite me, they cannot make me perish either. Even the Triune God Himself cannot make me perish. Once the spirit is saved, eternal life is assured. But the salvation of the soul cannot be settled today; it can only be gained at the time of the Lord's second coming.</P><P>The salvation of the spirit is a matter of today because, once a man believes, he has eternal life. The salvation of the soul is experienced at the time of the coming of the Son of Man.</P><P>The salvation of the spirit is the gift of grace today because "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son" (John 3:16). The salvation of the soul is a reward. It is a reward gained at the Lord's second coming by those who follow the Lord faithfully all their life.</P><P>For a man's soul to be saved, he must be one whose spirit is saved first. If the spirit is not saved, there is no possibility for the soul to be saved. We often speak of the salvation of the "spirit-soul" [a Chinese idiomatic expression]; actually, according to the Bible, it is the salvation of the soul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MARK 8:31-38</H2><P>The record in Mark 8:31-38 is largely the same as in Matthew, but there is a little difference, which I shall now point out.</P><P>"But whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it" (v. 35). Here three words are added, "and the gospel's." Most people think that this refers to those who preach the gospel for the Lord. But if this is the case, would it not mean that only the soul of the preachers will be saved? It does not say "the preaching of the gospel's"; it only says "the gospel's." What gospel is this gospel? It is the gospel spoken of in Mark 1:1: "The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." This gospel is the great salvation mentioned in Hebrews 2:3-4, which is "in leading many sons into glory" (Heb. 2:10). This is not the gospel of leaving Egypt and being freed from the slavery of sin; it is the gospel of entering into Canaan to receive glory.</P><P>"Loses his soul-life for My sake" (Matt. 16:25), is the result of being constrained by love. To "lose his soul-life for...the gospel's [sake]" (Mark 8:35) is for the benefit of one's own future, which is for the sake of the kingdom.</P><P>"For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation" (Mark 8:38). This indicates that he who is not willing to lose his soul-life is not willing to suffer for the Lord and His words in this age. In an adulterous and sinful generation, witnessing for the Lord's words indeed requires the losing of the soul. Unless a man really loses his soul, he cannot, in such a generation, witness for the Lord, much less shamelessly witness for Him. Many of God's children are never willing, nor do they dare, to witness before man for the Lord who purchased them. The reason is that they want to save their faces and are afraid of others' ridicule. This is to save one's soul in this life. Such a person will definitely suffer loss at the time of the kingdom. Everyone who is not willing to lose his soul in this age will not see the glory of the Lord. Everyone who will be a co-king with the Lord will have to lose his soul. Everyone who loses his soul in this age will find it in the coming age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LUKE 17:26-37</H2><P>"And even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; but on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind. Remember Lot's wife. Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive. I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left. There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left. And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Where the body is, there also will the vultures be gathered together."</P><P>These verses tell us the time when the soul is either saved or lost. The words in verses 34-35, "I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left. There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left," refer to the time of rapture. The difference here is that one will be raptured and one will be left. The word "taken" means to be raptured to heaven (Gen. 5:24); therefore, what is spoken of in verse 33, "Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive," means that whoever saves his soul in this age will be left behind at the appearing of the Son of Man; whoever loses his soul in this age will be raptured at the appearing of the Son of Man. There is no difference between the two persons, neither any difference in their work nor any difference in the place. But in the matter of rapture, there is a difference! In an instant, there will be a tremendous difference!</P><P>This is a sober matter! If we wish to be raptured, to see the Lord and enter into the kingdom, we must first lose the soul in this age. We must forsake the world for the Lord's sake and forsake everything that is not in accord with the Lord's will; we must abandon all that entangles us and hinders our heart from going upward. If we want to save our soul and cannot bear to forsake everything, we will, like Lot's wife, not be able to arrive at the place where the Lord will rapture us, even though we will not perish in Sodom and Gomorrah together with the sinners. There may not be any difference in gaining salvation and receiving eternal life, but there has to be a difference in the matter of the rapture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LUKE 12:15-21</H2><P>What is the meaning of losing the soul? We can find the explanation from reading Luke 12:15-21: "And He said to them, Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness, for no one's life is in the abundance of his possessions. And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly. And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have no place where I may gather my crops? And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather there all my wheat and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry. But God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be? So is he who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God." We can say that "to gain the soul" is to let the soul gain satisfaction and happiness and to let the soul have enjoyment, while "to lose the soul" is to let the soul be sorrowful, painful, and poor. Because of the abundance of his food and his goods, the soul of this rich man is already happy and satisfied in this age. He has already given his soul enjoyment; he has gained his soul in this age.</P><P>Therefore, to gain the soul is to let the soul have happiness in this age and to lose the soul is to leave nothing for the soul in this age. Our eyes see, our ears hear, and our hands and feet touch; but the one that is conscious of the happiness in them is the soul.</P><P>The soul is the seat of our natural desires. The soul causes us to have sentiments and enjoyment. The desires of the soul strongly demand satisfaction. Beautiful music can soothe emotions; literature and philosophy can elevate thoughts. But if we gain satisfaction from these things in this age, we will lose satisfaction in the coming age. If we have already gained the comfort given by these things in this age, we will lose the glory of the kingdom in the coming age.</P><P>Therefore, the one who saves his soul in this age is a Christian believer who has gained in this age the joy of ears and eyes and the happiness of the heart and mind; in the coming age he will lose such joy and happiness. Whoever gains that which belongs to this age will not gain that which belongs to the coming age. If a man loses in this age, he will have gain in the coming age. We should now understand the meaning of the salvation of the soul. To gain all the glory, joy, and satisfaction in the kingdom is to gain the soul; to lose all the glory, joy, and satisfaction in the kingdom is to lose the soul.</P><P>After we are saved, we cannot be unsaved. But our deeds have much to do with our position in the kingdom. What are you now pursuing? It is very difficult for the young ones to forsake the pleasures of the world. Many want to get satisfaction from housing, food, clothing and entertainment. This is to save their soul today; hence, they will surely lose their soul in the future. A saved person will not go to hell, but in the kingdom there are blessings which he will miss!</P><P>The Lord does not teach us asceticism. However, the Lord does not want us to be attracted by these things. These things are all legitimate, but legitimate things are not all profitable. Therefore, Paul says, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable" (1 Cor. 10:23). Whether clothing, food, or housing, you should not have the consciousness that you are enjoying something. Instead you should realize that these things are just good for glorifying God. Whenever you have any enjoyment, there is a problem. All that gives enjoyment to your soul saves your soul. The important thing is that one should not enjoy any kind of happiness that is not proper.</P><P>The one who loves the world is the one who saves his soul. But sin has entered the world. You should not, therefore, gain anything from this sinful world.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting in Shanghai<br>on July 19, 1930)<br>Issue No. 7</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 10:34-39</H2><P>Verse 34: "Do not think that I come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword." Why did the Lord say this? It was because people held the concept that He came to bring peace to the earth. To counter such a thought, He told them clearly, "I have not come to bring peace." Later we shall see that "peace" here refers not to the absence of war but to a situation in the family.</P><P>"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword." The sword here does not refer to a sword used in battle; neither does it refer to causing warfare on earth. In the original text, it means to cast a sword to the earth. Many people do recognize this fact. In Luke 2:35, Simeon said to Mary, "And a sword will pierce through your own soul also." The word "sword" here signifies that we will not be happy throughout our entire lifetime and that something like a sword will pierce through our hearts and cause us to suffer. What the Lord meant is that He came not for our blessing but to cause us hurt.</P><P>Verse 35: "For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law." This verse begins with the word "for." This indicates that this verse explains the last verse; that is, it explains what it means "to bring...a sword." Initially, there was a sweet relationship between father and son; now, there is alienation. The daughter is against the mother, and the daughter-in-law is against the mother-in-law.</P><P>Verse 36: "And a man's enemies will be those of his household." There are enemies and there is bitterness. The loved ones within one's family have turned against him and have hurt him. Within the family there is enmity and malice.</P><P>Verse 37: "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me." "Not worthy" is mentioned twice in this verse. Have you ever wondered why one should love the Lord above his parents and children? If you love just one person in this whole world more than you love the Lord, you cannot be His disciple. You can only be His disciple on the condition that you love Him wholly. This is the condition for becoming the Lord's disciple. You cannot love equally the Lord and men at the same time; this is not possible.</P><P>Verse 38: "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." This verse sums up what has been said before-this is a cross! What is it to take the cross? The Lord did not say, "He who does not take up his burden and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." He said, "He who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." A burden is not a cross. Burdens are unavoidable; taking the cross is optional.</P><P>How the first cross was, so will the hundreds and thousands of crosses thereafter be. Just as the first cross was the Lord's choosing, the crosses should be something that we choose.</P><P>Some people think that when they are in difficulties or in want, they are bearing the cross. Actually, this is not so because even if they were not believers, situations like these may naturally happen to them. Every cross must be of our own choosing. However, we must be careful that we do not create a cross for ourselves. We ought to take the cross, not make a cross.</P><P>It is a fallacy to regard everything which befalls us as a cross. It is just as wrong to create a cross by producing our own suffering. None of these are bearing the cross in reality.</P><P>What then is the cross? It must correspond to what the Lord Jesus said, "My Father,...Your will be done" (Matt. 26:42). The Lord asked the Father to not do according to what the Son wills but according to what the Father wills; this is the cross. To take the cross is to choose the Father's will. Let me say an honest word: if we do not choose the cross daily, there will be no cross for us to take. If the Lord were to wait for the cross to come to Him before He would bear it, how could a cross go to Him in heaven? The Lord chose the cross! He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross." The Lord said, "No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again" (John 10:18). Accordingly, our cross must also be out of our own choice.</P><P>Concerning the necessities of life, we also have a choice. We can choose what to wear, what to eat, and how to dwell. However, we should seek these things only to the extent of meeting our physical needs. If our emotion expects to derive pleasure and satisfaction from these necessities, we are not taking the cross. We cannot impose on others what sort of dress to wear, what kind of food to eat, or what type of house to live in. Nevertheless, whoever intends to be satisfied through these things is not bearing the cross. No one dares to say what one should or should not have, but everyone should ask himself whether or not his clothing, food, and shelter are, in fact, affording him soul pleasure and satisfaction.</P><P>Anything that is for the supply of our needs, God sanctions. Clothing, food, and shelter are all necessary. Even the Old Testament shows us how God provided for the children of Israel. He was mindful of their needs, yet He never intended that His children should indulge in those things. If we indulge ourselves in the matters of clothing, food and shelter, we are not taking the cross.</P><P>Too often people dress and eat not to protect their body, or to fill their hunger, but for sheer pleasure. Indeed, our physical needs must be met. But we should not gratify our emotion and its demands in the least.</P><P>Does God really interfere with man's clothing, eating, dwelling, and all his dealings? Yes, He does. And this constitutes the cross. Let us cite an example. When Adam was in the garden of Eden, whatever he needed was supplied to him. He could freely eat of every tree, but he was not to eat of one tree, that is, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If one were to eat of that tree, not because he wanted to satisfy his need, but because the fruits were pleasant to the sight, good for food, and enabled one to know good and evil, that would be a lust. God allows whatever is within the bounds of the necessities of our human living and nothing more. Clothing, food, shelter, and all such things of the world must be for the purpose of supplying our needs, not for gratifying our lust! Regarding these matters, we should live absolutely according to God's will. If we do not, we may ill-treat our own bodies according to the self-will of our flesh and may esteem ourselves holier than others when, in fact, we are practicing the doctrine of asceticism mentioned in Colossians 2, which is "not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh" (v. 23). At the same time, we should remember that God has not allowed us to indulge in the things of this world.</P><P>Verse 39: "He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." This verse concludes this portion of the word. What is it to take the cross? It is to lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake and to be in sorrow and distress for the Lord's sake. Those who refuse to be sorrowful and do not restrain their emotions, choosing rather to gratify their souls, will lose their soul-lives. To lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake is to deny the soul its satisfaction, requests, and desires. If, on account of the Lord, we choose not to pursue the things which we naturally enjoy and the things which we earnestly desire, we are losing our soul-life for the Lord's sake.</P><P>The meaning of gaining the soul-life today must be the same as the meaning of gaining the soul-life in the coming age. Likewise, the meaning of losing the soul-life today must be the same as the meaning of losing the soul-life in the coming age. The meaning in both cases must be the same.</P><P>To lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake means not allowing the soul to have satisfaction and enjoyment in this age. To lose the soul-life in the coming age means that the soul will not find satisfaction and enjoyment in the kingdom. In that day, there shall be a kind of people whose soul-life will be satisfied and another kind whose soul-life will not be satisfied. Whoever has satisfied his soul-life in this age and has had all things his way, having taken a supply in excess of his needs and having enjoyed a great many things, will not find anything in the coming kingdom. Whoever loses all these things in this age for the Lord's sake will be satisfied by God in the kingdom. Everyone who overcomes the world will definitely have satisfaction in the kingdom.</P><P>The salvation of the spirit is determined at the time we believed on the Lord. The salvation of the soul is determined by how we walk in this age. If you dress, eat, make friends, and do everything the way you like, I will tell you by the Lord's authority that you will have no share of the glory in the kingdom. The Gospel of Luke says, "Blessed are those who weep now...Woe to you who are satiated now" (Luke 6:21, 25). Why is it woe to those who are full? It is because they have already been filled. Why are those who weep now blessed? It is because they shall be filled in the coming age. Herein lies the distinction between woe and blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LUKE 14:25-35</H2><P>Verse 25: "And there were great crowds going along with Him, and He turned and said to them..." Why was there a great crowd with Jesus? It is because He had just preached the gospel by means of a parable (vv. 16-24). And just like the parable, many were invited, and whoever would eat came. The "many" are the Christians. It is a joy to be saved, and it is wonderful to continue in the enjoyment of God's grace. But to the very people who were with Him, the Lord turned and had a further word for them. He meant, "Yes, you are saved, but to follow Me there is a condition." The Lord raised the standard of the truth. Even such a great crowd was not enough reason for Him to lower the standard that God had prescribed. Therefore, though the truths concerning the kingdom and the kingship be high, neither should we refrain from speaking them on account of men.</P><P>The gate which opens to salvation through faith in Jesus is wide, but the gate which opens to following the Lord and being glorified with Him is narrow. "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37b). This is to be saved. However, to follow the Lord and be His disciple, there are certain conditions.</P><P>Verse 26: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple." The Lord brought up the matter of the soul-life again. First He mentioned the father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters. Finally, He mentioned the soul-life. If only man would not value his soul-life, all would be well. We should lay aside anything that brings our soul delight and pleasure.</P><P>The Lord did not say that you should cast out your father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters; rather, He said to do away with your natural life, that is, to channel all the love you have for these things to Him. This is absolutely necessary. When anyone follows Him, He specifically sets this huge obstacle in front of them. If they are able to go through it, they can go through anything in the future. The Lord does not wait for them to come through the gate before placing the obstacle before them; He makes it difficult right from the start. They are qualified to be His disciples only if they get through.</P><P>After the Lord has saved a person, He lays down this condition at the gate. He does not give one the condition after he has become a Christian for three or five years. Whether or not one can be His disciple is determined from the very beginning.</P><P>Verse 27: "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple." This verse explains the foregoing verses, which are on the bearing of the cross.</P><P>Following this, the Lord speaks of three parables, which explain the matter of the bearing of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Parable of Building a Tower-vv. 28-30</H2><P>Verse 28: "For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?" When the Lord spoke of "calculating the cost," do we not take it to mean that we should just forget about the building of this tower if we do not have the money? If that is the case, does it mean that He has not called many to follow Him? If they do not have sufficient funds, does it mean that they should give up building the tower? No, they should not give up, for if everyone were to put in every single penny he has, it would definitely be sufficient, and no one would dare to say that he does not have enough. What the Lord was saying was that when a man wants to build a tower, it is a question of whether or not he is willing to put in all his money for the building. For example, if five hundred dollars is required to build a tower, but the man is only willing to put in three hundred, keeping the remaining two hundred, one cannot say that his funds are inadequate. It is inadequate only because a portion of his money is kept for other use. If one keeps back a portion of his love for others, he will not be able to love Christ. He must hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters and must turn his heart away from them. The Lord does not ask how much you have given Him; He asks if you have given Him your all.</P><P>Verses 29-30: "Lest perhaps, once he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all those looking on will begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish." This is the end of him who would not wholly love the Lord. He can only lay a foundation without building the tower because he is holding back something from the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Parable of War-vv. 31-32</H2><P>Verse 31: "Or what king, going to engage another king in war, will not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet the one coming against him with twenty thousand?" This does not mean that ten thousand soldiers are all the king has; it means only ten thousand are mobilized. If he is willing to send out the entire nation, he will certainly win.</P><P>Verse 32: "Otherwise, while he is yet at a distance, he sends an envoy and asks for the terms of peace." This means that if he is not willing to mobilize the entire force, it would be better for him to ask for terms of peace while there is still time and acknowledge defeat.</P><P>If everyone is willing to give his all, whether to build a tower or fight a battle, it will be enough; if everyone holds back a portion, it will come short. Suppose I go into the Bible Society with sixty cents, and the book I want costs sixty cents. If I pay ten cents for it, it will be inadequate. If I pay fifty-nine cents and keep one cent, it will still be inadequate. Whosoever does not bear his cross and follow after the Lord surely is not worthy of being, and cannot be, His disciple.</P><P>Whoever loves the world a little is not fit for the kingdom. But even those whose hands are on the plow are not fit for the kingdom if they look back.</P><P>It is not a question of being sufficient or insufficient, but a question of whether or not we have given our all. This is the cross. We must bear the cross. We must put our all on the cross. Some may ask, how do you know that this parable teaches us to lay our all on the cross? We know it from the Lord's own word in the next verse.</P><P>Verse 33: "In the same way therefore everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple." This verse is a continuation of the previous verse. The Lord said that the problem with the above two cases was not that they did not have but that they would not renounce all they had. Often we cannot make up our mind; we want both. On the one hand, we love the world; on the other hand, we love the Lord. We cannot give ourselves to absolutely love the Lord, and yet we are ashamed to absolutely love the world for fear of offending the Lord. There is the unwillingness to commit everything for the building, and yet there is also a sense of misgiving if we do not at least put in a certain amount. The result of this is to lay a little of the foundation and leave the tower unfinished. If there is not the willingness to mobilize the entire force, one can only leave some to defeat or send an envoy to negotiate for peace. Those who are this way should not even consider being the Lord's disciples. To be His disciple, one must renounce all that he has. He cannot hold onto the world with one hand and hold onto the Lord with the other. He must abandon one-either the world or Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Parable of Salt-vv. 34-35</H2><P>This parable shows us the outcome of the two kinds of persons previously mentioned. According to Matthew 5:13, which says, "You are the salt of the earth," the salt refers to the Christian.</P><P>Verse 34: "Therefore salt is good; but if even the salt becomes tasteless, with what will its saltiness be restored?" Salt is good and is beneficial to men. Taste signifies separation. It is most important that a Christian be separated from others. If the salt becomes tasteless, nothing will restore its saltiness. Suppose someone buys a piece of meat and wants to season it with salt. If he has the meat but has no salt, there is still the possibility of having the savor; but if he has both the meat and the salt, yet the salt has lost its taste, there is no possibility of having the savor.</P><P>Verse 35: "It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure pile; they will throw it out." If we lose our taste, that is, if we are not separated, the consequence will be what is in this verse; we will be thrown out.</P><P>The "land" signifies the kingdom. It is not fit to put the Christian who has lost his taste into God's kingdom.</P><P>The "manure pile" is a filthy and unclean place; it signifies Gehenna, which is the lake of fire. Neither is it fit to put the Christian who has lost his taste into the lake of fire, because he is already saved.</P><P>"They will throw it out." Since he is neither fit for the kingdom nor for the lake of fire, he is cast out, that is, cast outside of the glory of the kingdom.</P><P>"He who has ears to hear, let him hear." This is a warning. Anything which severs us from Christ also causes us to lose our taste. To preserve the taste is to have strength; to lose the taste is to lose strength. This is a serious matter! We must not love the world; we must wholly love the Lord. Otherwise, the kingdom will have nothing to do with us. It is not a question of how much we have done. Rather, is our all on the altar? Today is the time for consecration to the Lord; to consecrate on that day will be too late.</P><P>These three parables depict the life of a believer who is not willing to lose his soul-life in this age. The reason for his unwillingness to give his all to build and fight and the reason for his becoming tasteless salt as a consequence of mingling with the world is that he loves his own soul-life. He cannot bear to have the self suffer. He is not willing to forsake the pleasures of this world. He can only care for the present age because he has but a dim vision of the glory of the coming kingdom. If we are willing to renounce the demands of our soul, deny the self, bear the cross, and do God's will, it will not be difficult for us to build, fight, or hate our father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters. It will not even be difficult to be completely separated from the world and be the salt with taste. If we do not lose our soul-life but walk according to our likes and dislikes in this age, and if our consecration is not thorough, we shall be thrown out during the kingdom age and be mocked as those not befitting the Lord's discipleship.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting Given in Shanghai<br>on August 7, 1930)<br>Issue No. 8</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 21:5-19</H1><P>By reading through verses 5 to 19, we know that this portion of the word also speaks concerning the salvation of the soul. "In your endurance you will possess your souls" (v. 19). I have said before that the Bible always mentions faith when it talks about our salvation. However, here it says that by your endurance you will gain your souls. Hence, there must be a difference between the salvation of the soul and the salvation of the spirit.</P><P>If I remember correctly, the Gospel of John mentions the matter of receiving eternal life through faith on thirty-five occasions. In the whole New Testament, justification by faith, receiving eternal life by faith, and salvation through faith are mentioned one hundred fifty times. Here, however, it mentions endurance. To endure is not to believe; it is a work. So the salvation of the soul is very different from the receiving of eternal life.</P><P>Let us see how these verses talk about the salvation of the soul. Verses 5-7 say, "And as some were speaking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated offerings, He said, As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone which will not be thrown down. And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?" The temple is the holy temple in Jerusalem. "You" refers to the disciples. "These things" refers to what the Lord Jesus said in verse 6: "The days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone which will not be thrown down." This signifies the coming destruction of the temple. Take note of verse 7. The questions asked are very similar to those in chapter twenty-four of Matthew; nevertheless, there is a difference. Let us compare the two.</P><P>Matthew 24:3: "And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" Matthew is concerned not only with the destruction of Jerusalem but also with the Lord's coming and the completion of the age. Luke 21 is concerned only with the matter of Jerusalem's destruction. In Luke the disciples asked when these things (Jerusalem's destruction) would be and what would be the sign before these things take place. They did not ask anything about the Lord's coming back or the completion of the age. We should remember that three things were asked in Matthew. The first was, "When will these things be?" The second and the third were, "What will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" Only one thing was asked in Luke, that is, when would these things be and what would be the sign before these things take place? The questions recorded in Luke are identical to the first question in Matthew.</P><P>The destruction of Jerusalem was fulfilled in A.D. 70. The Lord's word about there not being one stone left upon another was fulfilled.</P><P>Verses 8-9: "And He said, See that you are not led astray, for many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and, The time has drawn near! Do not go after them. And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified, for these things must take place first; but the end does not come immediately." This is what the Lord instructed the disciples to watch for at the time when Jerusalem would be destroyed. Church history can attest to the fact that when the Lord ascended, some did come in His name saying, "I am the Christ." The Lord meant that when some come claiming to be Christ and when the disciples hear of wars and revolutions, they must realize that the end has not yet come.</P><P>Verses 10-12: "Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for the sake of My name." All these were fulfilled during the age of the apostles. They were apprehended, persecuted, scourged, and imprisoned, and they were brought before kings and governors.</P><P>Verse 13: "It will turn out to you for a testimony." They suffered so much, yet those sufferings became the very occasions for them to testify. They testified in synagogues, before Felix, and before those in Rome.</P><P>Verses 14-18: "Settle it therefore in your hearts not to take thought beforehand how to reply in defense, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to resist or refute. And you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. And you will be hated by all because of My name, yet a hair of your head shall by no means perish." Here, the Lord prophesied concerning what they would experience.</P><P>Verse 19: "In your endurance you will possess your souls." The disciples are held responsible for this last matter. When all these sufferings and persecutions come, they must endure; in this way they will possess their souls.</P><P>To possess the soul means to reign with the Lord and share in His glory when He comes. If possessing the soul means the same as receiving eternal life, then the words "possess your soul" in verse 19 do not make sense. It is saying that if, in the midst of extreme hardship, we are able to endure, we will possess our soul. Through faith we have eternal life and are saved. But here we are told that to possess our soul we need to endure all these sufferings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 12:25</H2><P>"He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." The Lord says here that it is possible for one to lose his soul-life. One loses his soul-life only because he loves it.</P><P>What is it to love the soul-life? It means to gratify our desires and please our emotions. For example, the Lord calls us to stay away from a certain matter; if we want to obey Him, we must lay down our self. Each time we want to obey the Lord, we must lay down the self. If we seek to do His will while loving our soul-life, we will fail. Perhaps the Lord wants us to drop something which we enjoy doing or give up a person or an object we like. If we love our soul-life, we will not succeed. Many times we are entangled with a person, thing, or matter. Many are beset by friends; they would rather have the friends than lose the soulish enjoyment in this age.</P><P>We recognize that many of the bad things are sins. However, we do not realize that we can also be entangled by the things we normally enjoy. We are aware that money is too base and contemptible a thing to be mentioned, yet many cannot part with it. Even a dress or a meal may ensnare a person. Why is it so difficult for man not to love his soul-life? Because not loving the soul-life means to cause it to suffer, while loving the soul-life means not to allow it to suffer. Such a person, however, will undoubtedly lose his soul-life because he has already cared for his soul-life and allowed it to enjoy!</P><P>When does one lose his soul-life? It will be when the Lord establishes His kingdom. Whoever loves his soul-life in this age will not enjoy glory or reign with the Lord at that time. To have eternal life through faith is certain; our going to heaven is certain. But to reign as a king and ensure that the soul-life will find enjoyment in the millennium requires that we do not love our soul-life today.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I have said before and I say again: God gives sinners a choice between heaven and hell. If a sinner can see clearly, no doubt he will choose heaven. Now God gives Christians a choice between the kingdom and the world. Do we choose the kingdom? Or do we choose the world? How sad that although a sinner prefers heaven, many Christians prefer to have the world! We think that it is good enough to be saved, yet after we are saved, God still puts the coming kingdom before us for us to choose.</P><P>Those who are full now will not be filled in glory; they will lose their enjoyment. The Lord said that whoever loves himself shall lose his soul-life; whoever hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life. Our soul is linked to the world. To love the soul in this world means to care for ourselves in this world. Good food, nice clothing, friends, happiness, compliments, fame-all are desirable. However, they nourish the soul-life as food nourishes us. To nourish the soul-life now is to lose the soul-life in the kingdom.</P><P>To lose the soul-life is not to be cast into hell. It is to cause the soul to suffer in that it cannot reign with the Lord. In the kingdom age, the Lord will assign ten cities or five cities for us to rule. According to the Old Testament prophets, this will be such a pleasant time. How pleasant it will be to rule ten cities or five cities in such an atmosphere! However, whoever has already gained his soul-life in this world shall lose his soul-life in the kingdom. This is serious! Whoever is full now and has satisfied his soul-life in the present age, will not gain anything in the kingdom. I have said this many times, and I will keep saying it: to hate the soul-life in this world is to not allow the soul-life to have satisfaction and enjoyment in this age. It is to turn your back to the world and your face to God, and to be armed with a will to suffer, whatever the situation may be. If one does this, he will gain his soul-life in the kingdom. If you gain something here, it follows that you will lose something there. Either you gain or you lose. To gain today is to suffer loss in the future. To gain in the future, you must suffer loss today.</P><P>Once a person believes, it is definite that he has eternal life, and it is definite that every believer will be in the New Jerusalem. But before heaven and earth pass away, some believers will have no part in the kingdom. "He who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." Therefore, please pay attention to this: the Lord hates two things. First, He hates our sins; second, He hates our soul-life, which is just our self. Because the Lord hates our sins, He died for us. By believing in Him, we receive eternal life. Because the Lord hates our soul-life, He wants to do away with it (that is, to eliminate the soulish life, not the function of the soul).</P><P>Here is the difference between the soul-life and sins: whatever the soul desires may not be sinful. Lying, pride, jealousy, etc., are sins. But to wear what you should not wear or eat what you should not eat is the soul-life. Nice clothing, good food, and extravagant spending cannot be considered sinful, but they certainly gratify the soul.</P><P>Madame Guyon was one who was very deep in the Lord during the seventeenth century. She clearly realized the difference between sins and the soul-life. She did not express it in the same way we do, yet her experiences verified the same thing. She was born and raised in France; her family was related to the class of nobility, and she had the title of "Madame." Each time she visited Paris, she was fearful because she knew very well that her heart would be moved by the things she saw. Later, she overcame this. However, she became fearful of another thing: to look into the mirror. She was very attractive; the more she looked at herself in the mirror, the more she was conscious of her beauty. She even thought that when she walked, she carried herself far more gracefully than all the other women. This is the soul-life. The soul is man's natural nature, that is, the nature he has as a creature.</P><P>If a person believes in the Lord and overcomes sins, he can enter heaven. But if he puts away the soul-life and overcomes it, he can enter the kingdom. The reason God does not allow us to indulge ourselves in the matter of clothing, food, and shelter in this age is that these things have already been infected with the world. To possess these things is to be contaminated with the world. Today even a dress or a meal readily causes us to fall into the world. However, when we are in the kingdom, no matter how much we appreciate the beautiful scenery, it will only cause us to praise God's creation the more. Even the appreciation of ourselves at that time will only motivate us to praise God for His salvation. There will be no trace of sin in the kingdom because Satan will be bound and sin will not be in this world.</P><P>When God's Son was on the earth, the only thing He took was the cross; the rest was borrowed. The manger was borrowed; the inn was borrowed; the donkey which carried Him into Jerusalem was borrowed; and the room where they kept the Passover feast was borrowed. Finally, even the tomb was borrowed. He had nothing that was not borrowed. How different we are from Him!</P><P>Those who overcome sins go to heaven; those who overcome the world go to the kingdom. This is certain. God is calling us for this one thing-to not love the world and only desire the kingdom. He wants us to hate our self and seek after the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HEBREWS 10:38-39</H2><P>Verse 38: "But My righteous one shall live by faith." The righteous ones here are us who have been saved through faith in Jesus. For the righteous ones to live by faith means that those who are saved shall live by faith day by day. Many have asked me, "If justification is by faith, and the justified ones still have to live by faith, are there then two faiths?" Well, I shall talk about the second faith later. For now, just remember that every justified person must live by faith.</P><P>"And if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him." "He" refers to the righteous one. "If he shrinks back." Only a believer has the possibility of shrinking back. Although a justified person is saved, it is still possible for him to shrink back. "My" refers to God. God has no pleasure in a justified person who shrinks back.</P><P>Verse 39: "But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul." What happens when one shrinks back? He shrinks back to ruin. Believers have eternal life and shall not perish. However, it is still possible for us to shrink back to ruin. What is ruin? It means that everything has become vain, destroyed, and finished. But we are "of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul." Here again, this word speaks of the salvation of the soul. To shrink back is to shrink back to ruin; to come forward is to come forward to the saving of the soul. We either shrink back to ruin or come forward to the saving of the soul.</P><P>Some think that since "shrink back to ruin" sounds so unpleasant, it must not refer to Christians. However, only a Christian has the possibility of shrinking back. Sinners have nowhere to shrink back to. Where can they shrink back to? Whoever does not believe in the Son, his sins are condemned already. Only a Christian has the possibility of shrinking back. A believer should actually be rewarded for his works on earth. But because he shrinks back, all is lost. Although he has preached the word in the Lord's name, cast out demons in the Lord's name, and performed many miracles, the Lord will not acknowledge any of those. Instead, He will say to him, "I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness" (Matt. 7:23).</P><P>However, "we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul." Here it speaks of the salvation of the soul through faith. What is this faith? What is meant by "but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul"? Let us read Hebrews 11:1. "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This is the faith for the salvation of the soul. This is the faith which the righteous ones live by. Chapter eleven should immediately follow the last verse of chapter ten. This faith is "the substantiation of things hoped for"; it is not the faith in Jesus. This faith can save your soul. This faith is "the conviction of things not seen"; it is not faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Gospel of John mentions many times that one receives eternal life by believing in the Son. Those instances refer to the faith in the Lord. Here faith refers to a thing.</P><P>What is the thing? Let us read Hebrews 11:13-16. "All these died in faith, not receiving the promises but seeing them from afar and joyfully greeting them and confessing that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth. For those who say such things make it manifest that they seek after a country of their own. And if indeed they continued to remember that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return; but as it is, they long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them." Have we seen it? What does it say this faith is? It is believing that God has prepared a city for them in the kingdom; it is believing that they are but strangers and sojourners on this earth, that this earth is not their country, and that everything they have is in the future and not in this present age. A city standing firmly cannot fall. The righteous ones believe in this daily, and they live by this faith. The soul is saved by this faith. Unfortunately, many believers forget that they are merely strangers and sojourners on the earth!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JAMES 1:17-21</H2><P>Verses 17-18: "All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning. He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures." Verse 17 mentions the gift; verse 18 says that God brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. These two verses go together. Verse 17 says that God gave a gift; verse 18 says that this gift is the eternal life which God has given us. This shows that those who received this Epistle of James already had the gift. They were already the firstfruits; they had already been brought forth of God by the word of truth and were already saved.</P><P>Verses 19-21: "You know this, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God. Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls." That the hearers were addressed as the beloved brothers in verse 19 proves that they were saved already. It is as if James is saying, "You know that you have been regenerated and are saved, but this is not enough; you still need to `receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.'" James shows us very clearly that even though a man is regenerated, his soul is not yet saved; he still needs to receive the word that is able to save his soul. The salvation of the soul is a matter which comes after regeneration. If a person is not regenerated, it is not possible for his soul to be saved. God has preached to us the word, which is the gospel of the kingdom. Now we must lose our soul-life today. I have already mentioned twice that there are many things which we ourselves are unable to do. However, if we are willing to allow the Holy Spirit to work in us, He can do these things for us. Gaining the soul is similar to gaining eternal life; if a sinner refuses to be saved, God will not put him in heaven. Whoever will, may certainly drink freely the water of life. Nevertheless, if one is not willing to come to the Lord, He has no way to save him. Likewise, if we are not willing to lose our soul-life, neither will the Lord put us into the kingdom. We must ask the Lord to bring us to the point where we are willing to lose our soul-life; then the Lord can have a way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 1:3-9</H2><P>Verses 3-4: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you." These two verses tell us that those who received this Epistle have been saved.</P><P>Verse 5: "Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time." What is the faith referred to here? It is the same faith which the righteous live by in Hebrews 10:38. Although they are saved, they still have not obtained the salvation which is ready to be revealed at the last time. It is good to be regenerated, but it is not sufficient. We still need to gain the salvation ready to be revealed at the last time.</P><P>Verses 6-8: "In which time you exult, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been made sorrowful by various trials, so that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory." These verses say that because of the salvation that is to come, one is able to rejoice in spite of the various trials.</P><P>Verse 9: "Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls." Again, this verse clearly speaks of the salvation of the soul. Peter is also one who says that those who have been regenerated need a further salvation, the salvation of the soul. When will one receive this salvation? It will be received at the last time, which is the time of the Lord's manifestation on the earth. The final end of every saved person is the same, but in the kingdom there are differences. It is true that once we believe on the Lord, we are saved. But our soul also must be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 2:11</H2><P>"Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." When the lusts war against the soul, the soul profits nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 2:25</H2><P>"For you were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls." Let us lay hold of this verse; we do have a Shepherd who oversees our souls.</P><P>Finally, I want to mention two more verses. Let us pay attention to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 4:17-19</H2><P>"For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God? And if the righteous man is saved only with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear? So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator." Let us lay hold of God's word. We are God's house already. Yet judgment begins from the house of God. Some of the righteous ones are scarcely saved! So brothers and sisters, we must suffer according to the will of God and commit our souls to the faithful Creator! We must not hold back anything for the soul-life or allow the soul-life to have enjoyment. Rather, let us suffer according to the will of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 1:10-11</H2><P>"Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble. For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you." The fact that these ones were called brothers shows that they were saved. However, they still needed to be more diligent to make their calling and election firm. Eternal life, once received, cannot be shaken. But in the kingdom, some shall be shaken.</P><P>Let us compare the two phrases: "saved only with difficulty" and an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ being "richly and bountifully supplied." The one is scarcely saved and has not advanced any further than regeneration. It is like obtaining only a mark of 70 when the lowest passing mark is 70. This is a half salvation. We must be one unto whom the entrance into the kingdom is richly and bountifully supplied.</P><P>I will now relate a story to illustrate this point. At the end of the European War, there was a huge celebration in London. The turnout was unprecedented in the history of London. The war had just concluded, and the soldiers were having a victory parade and were there to be welcomed by the crowd. As the soldiers paraded through, the people cheered and applauded. In the minds of many, were it not for the courage of these soldiers, England could not have been saved. The applause persisted as the soldiers marched onward step by step. While the units passed by rank after rank, suddenly, there was a crescendo of applause; in fact, many started weeping. The nobility saluted, and even the king took off his crown. What had happened? Trailing behind was car after car of soldiers who had either broken arms, injured legs, missing limbs, or serious wounds. These were the ones who were wounded in battle. They were received with the greatest honor and respect. The soldiers who marched ahead of them made it; however, the glory they received could hardly be compared to that of these wounded soldiers.</P><P>Those who are scarcely saved will enter into heaven on that day, but they will not have a rich and abundant entrance into God's kingdom. If we have suffered on earth and forsaken things for the Lord's sake, on that day we will enjoy what those wounded soldiers enjoyed in their triumphant procession. The applause will be loud, the praises will be great, and the glory will also be great. Every one of us should endure pain and suffer loss for the Lord's sake. On that day, we will receive a crown on our head. Our soul must be saved. May we be poorer, may we suffer more, and may we forsake all for the Lord's sake. May God bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GLEANINGS FROM ENOCH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>I will now speak something concerning Enoch. It will be like a kind of gleaning. I do not know when Enoch repented, and what he did before he was sixty-five years old. But we know that he began to walk with God at the age of sixty-five after he begot Methuselah. We know nothing about his life before sixty-five. But we know that after he begot Methuselah, he had a change. It might have been due to seeing a prophecy. He lived to three hundred sixty-five years of age. The remaining three hundred years he walked with God. The name of his son must have a deep significance. The name Methuselah means "at the time of his death, that thing will occur." After Enoch begot Methuselah, he surely would have sought earnestly before God about the name of his son. Surely God showed him the coming great tribulation. He was surely warned and became fearful.</P><P>It is interesting that Noah preached righteousness, while Enoch preached judgment. Noah preached the way of salvation because God revealed the ark to him. Enoch preached judgment because he received revelation through the name of his son. We can only preach the things that have produced an effect upon us. Through faith, Noah prepared an ark. Through faith, Enoch received the benefit of walking with God.</P><P>It is good if we know that sinners, the flesh, and the world will all be judged. Peter said, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up" (2 Pet. 3:10). If this is the end of the world, are we still going to love it? Will anyone deposit money into a bank when he knows that the bank is going to go bankrupt? If the bank is going to go bankrupt, no one will want to deposit his money into it. Since we know the end of the world already, and that it will be burned, we should not love it anymore. Enoch realized the meaning of the name "Methuselah"; he was watchful and was therefore raptured. Now we will consider a few things about Enoch.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENOCH'S ENVIRONMENT</H2><P>Did Enoch walk with God because his environment was better than others? No. Let us first consider the environment in his home. Genesis 5:22 says, "And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters." Some have said that preachers can walk with God all day long. But how can those with many household responsibilities walk with God? But what does the Bible say about the first man who walked with God? He walked with God and begat sons and daughters. Some have asked how one can walk with God when he works in a factory, and only hears the sound of machinery all day long. But Enoch walked with God for three hundred years and begat sons and daughters. He was not free from household responsibilities. The life which we received is not expressed only in smooth environments; it can be expressed in every environment. We can walk with God not only in a smooth environment but in any environment. The complexity of family chores and a great number of children cannot stop a man who truly walks with God from doing what he is doing. A believer can walk with God not because his family burdens are little or his business responsibilities are light, but because he can be free from the entanglement of these things in contrast to the unbelievers. He can walk with God in such circumstances. It was possible for Enoch to walk with God under such circumstances.</P><P>Not only was Enoch faced with a condition in his family, but the environment of the age was also very dark. At the time of Enoch, Adam was still alive. In Genesis 4, we see that the tribe that came from Cain was still around. What was it like? "And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah" (v. 19). Lamech was the first one to break God's law of monogamy. From that time on, polygamy was practiced. The name Adah means "beautiful"; she was given to adornment. The trend was already becoming evil, and women were striving to be fashionable. "And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle" (v. 20). This is the first case of cattle farming for profit. "And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ" (v. 21). By then, men began to give themselves to music and entertainment. "And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" (v. 22). The artificers in brass and iron made weapons. By then warfare had started. However, in the midst of such an age, Enoch walked with God.</P><P>Is it not today's picture that men indulge in their lusts, scheme for wealth, give themselves to music, and brandish weapons? God tells us that in such an age, Enoch walked with Him for three hundred years. What about us today? Are we walking with God? Mr. G. H. Pember from England is a man deep in the Lord. A few decades ago, he prophesied that men would pay more attention to music, higher knowledge, and the wielding of weapons, while there would be an unprecedented movement for women's rights. What about today? We know that his words have come true. Under such circumstances, we should walk with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENOCH'S RAPTURE</H2><P>Hebrews 11:5: "By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God." How was Enoch raptured? He was raptured because of his faith. What did Enoch do to make himself well pleasing to God? He walked with God; before his rapture he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God. He was well pleasing to God because he walked with God, and he was translated because of his faith. Every one of us should walk to such an extent that we become well pleasing to God, and every one of us should believe in Him to the extent that we become raptured.</P><P>Every believer will be raptured. But the ones who will be raptured first are surely the overcoming believers. There is no such thing as the whole church being raptured. Only those who are prepared and who wait for the Lord watchfully will be raptured. If you do not have faith, you will not be raptured. You must believe that you will be raptured, and then you will be raptured. If you do not believe that you will be raptured, you will not be raptured. You have to ask God to give you a faith in the rapture so that you can believe that you will be raptured!</P><P>It is amazing that Enoch alone had this faith. He had this faith because he walked with God. Faith is connected to the conscience. Once the conscience has a crack, faith will be damaged. Once the conscience has a hole, faith will leak out. Once faith leaks out, one will not be able to be raptured. Many believers cannot believe in the rapture because they have never walked with God. If we walk with God day by day, He will give us faith for the rapture. Many times when our spiritual condition is good, we are comforted at the thought of the Lord's coming. This is one side of the story. Does this mean that we are believing in ourselves? No, we are not, for there is still another side of the story.</P><P>The word in Hebrews 11:6 follows that of verse 5. Verse 6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." This verse speaks of two kinds of believing. The first is that we have to believe that God is, that is, to believe that God is indeed as He says He is. The second is that we have to believe that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. From this we see that there were two steps to Enoch's faith. First, he believed that God is who He says He is, and second, he sought God's presence diligently and believed that God would reward him. Enoch surely sought to be delivered from the coming tribulation. This is why God rewarded his seeking with the rapture.</P><P>Have we ever prayed for God to deliver us from the coming great tribulation? Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." Many people think that this passage tells us that God will deliver those who are watchful and beseeching at every time from the coming great tribulation. But that is not what this passage says. This is a prayer-a prayer that beseeches in watchfulness at all times for God to deliver one out of the coming great tribulation. This also was Enoch's prayer. Those who pray this way will be raptured. Hence, for us to wait for the Lord's return, we must diligently beseech God to deliver us from the coming great tribulation. Day by day, we should believe that the rapture is near. We should have good conduct so that our conscience will not condemn us and so that we can single-heartedly wait for the rapture. We should believe in God and beseech Him this way. If we do this every day, we will surely be raptured. Now is the time for God to prepare the Enochs. How many of our prayers are answered? Do we believe that we will be raptured? We should at least have an answer to one of our prayers which is the prayer for deliverance from the coming great tribulation. If we have never prayed this prayer, we have to pray it now until God answers us.</P><P>Concerning the matter of walking with God, it is well if we have a good beginning, and it is good if we have a good continuation. But the most important thing is that we have a good ending. Many people begin by walking with God, but unfortunately, they are not able to enter into glory! Many people are afraid when they hear about the great tribulation and the judgment. But they do not have a good ending. The rapture is not a historical event that happens suddenly. Rather, we reach the state of being raptured day by day. The twinkling of an eye in 1 Corinthians 15 refers to the change of our body; it does not refer to the change of our life. Rapture is a walking together, not a flying together; we walk with the Lord into glory. One brother said that a Christian's experience in the Lord is sequential; first the death, then the resurrection, and then the rapture. One passes from one stage to another and enters into glory at the end. Many times, it is very difficult to obey in some matters. But the more we die, the more the Lord's life will fill us up, and the more we will advance towards the rapture. I say again: the rapture is not a historical event; it is a gradual rapture which consummates in glory.</P><P>Enoch walked with God for three hundred years. By the time he was raptured, he had become well-acquainted with God. One brother said that when many arrive in heaven, they will find God very unfamiliar, for they have never walked with Him on earth. We must walk with God day by day and step by step until we are fully sanctified. The only unfinished part of sanctification should be with our body and not with our spirit. Our spirit must be ready today. May God be gracious to us so that we can walk with God like Enoch did. If Enoch could do it, so can we.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A BELIEVER'S WORTH BEFORE GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given in Shanghai on December 8, 1930)<br>Issue No. 12</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 30:11-16; Lev. 27:1-8</H1><P>Every time the life of a person is remembered before God, he will suffer a plague if he does not have a sin offering. "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying...then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" (Exo. 30:11-12). When David sent Joab to number Israel, God was displeased and sent pestilence upon Israel (1 Chron. 21). A man without the blood will be judged right away.</P><P>Now, we shall first outline the main points of the two passages recorded in Exodus 30 and Leviticus 27; then we will point out the meaning of these two passages.</P><P>Exodus records:</P><P>(1) "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" (vv. 11-12).</P><P>(2) "This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary...a half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord" (v. 13).</P><P>(3) "Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord" (v. 14).</P><P>(4) "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel" (v. 15).</P><P>Leviticus records:</P><P>(1) "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow to Jehovah involving the valuation of persons" (vv. 1-2).</P><P>(2) "Then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels. If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. And if the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver. If the person is from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, the valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels" (vv. 3-7).</P><P>(3) "But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him" (v. 8).</P><P>We can see a big difference in these two passages. In the book of Exodus, whoever is numbered, whether male or female, rich or poor, must offer half a shekel and half a shekel only as long as he is twenty years old and above. But it is different in Leviticus. There the offering differs according to sex and according to whether one is rich or poor. Why is there such a difference? It is because Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, and Leviticus speaks of the valuation of the special vow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORTH OF SALVATION</H2><P>Since Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, half a shekel is required of a person who is twenty years of age and older, whether male or female because this is a matter of salvation. This half shekel is required of every man. If anyone fails to offer it, he will suffer a plague. Every person must have the Son of God in order to be saved. As to the position of the salvation of sinners, we all have the same worth before God.</P><P>"Half a shekel" is equivalent to the two denarii mentioned in Luke 10:35. These two denarii have been paid by the Lord Jesus for us. These two denarii are sufficient for us to live in the inn (temporal life in the world) until the second coming of our Savior.</P><P>"Twenty years old" is the age when a person is able to take responsibility for himself. The teaching here is that whoever is responsible for himself must have the Son of God. For the Israelites, responsibility was determined on the basis of their physical age, but for us in the dispensation of the grace of salvation, no one knows when a person can be responsible for himself. It is possible that some people have reached this age of responsibility at seven or eight years of age.</P><P>"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less." Because the precious blood is the price, there is no difference between the poor and rich. Poverty and riches can be compared to the deeds of men. Those who do not have good deeds cannot save themselves; likewise, those who have good deeds cannot save themselves. They all have to offer half a shekel. Man cannot add anything to or deduct anything from the salvation accomplished by the Lord. Man can only be saved by the precious blood. This blood is called the precious blood because it is indeed "precious," and is full of worth (1 Pet. 1:19). The precious blood is a high price!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORTH OF A SINGULAR VOW</H2><P>But the worth of a special vow is at least six times more than that of the ransom for life because the least amount is three shekels (Lev. 27:6). In some cases there is a hundredfold difference because some have to offer fifty shekels (v. 3). Why is there such a difference? This is because Exodus talks about salvation, whereas Leviticus talks about consecration.</P><P>Consecration means that it is not a matter of how much one likes to offer. Rather, it is a matter of how much God thinks we are worth based on our willingness to consecrate. From the viewpoint of salvation, God considers all of us worth half a shekel; no one is worth more than another, and everyone is worth the same regardless of wealth and age. Our natural constitution is put aside completely by God because what causes us to be saved is the Son of God. No one can be saved by adding anything to or deducting anything from the Son of God. According to grace, all men are the same in that all have sinned, and the price of salvation is the same for all. Through Christ, God sees our worth as the same. God treasures us and considers us of worth. Nevertheless, this worth is in His Son. Hence, our worth derived as a result of salvation is the same before God.</P><P>However, this fact does not prohibit God from esteeming some believers as having more value than others. Although believers are all saved the same way and are all children of God, some are greater in spiritual usefulness, and their consecrations are more thorough than those of others. As a result, God considers them as having more worth than others. Here we should note two things: one is a man's spiritual usefulness, and the other is his sincere consecration. God considers our worth based on our spiritual usefulness plus our sincere consecration. If we are useful spiritually yet without consecration, before God we do not have any value other than that obtained through Christ. If we are willing to consecrate and the consecration is sincere, we are of some worth in the eyes of God even though our age is only one month to five years old. It is very dreadful that a believer might not be worth anything before God! For the ransom of life, half a shekel is enough to guarantee his salvation. But with regard to consecration, if you would consecrate to God, you are of some value even though you may be only one month old.</P><P>The life of a man is divided into four periods: one month to five years old is childhood; five years to twenty years old is the period of youth; twenty years to sixty years old is the adult period; sixty years and above is the period of old age. As far as the Israelites were concerned, their age was based on their physical years. For believers, their age refers to the strength and depth of their spirituality.</P><P>Salvation is the same for all, whereas consecration depends on the individual. Every saved one should have some worth in the eyes of God. In Leviticus, ages of one month to five years old are valued at five shekels. Once a person is saved, he should be of some worth. God's estimation of the value of those between one month old and five years old is five shekels. He who is newly saved should at least have some worth before God. But this worth stems from his consecration. Without consecration, God does not view us as having any value. After a person is saved, the only work of the Holy Spirit is to lead him to consecrate himself and live for God. Israelites of five years old to twenty years old can be compared to those young believers who are burning and have some spiritual experiences. The adult period signifies the strong, matured, and experienced believers.</P><P>But why is the value of those who are sixty and older reduced? Although Caleb was old in age, he was as strong as when he was young (Josh. 14:11). Psalm 92:14 says, "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; / they shall be fat and flourishing." So we see that some old people are very good. Our spiritual condition indeed does not have to grow old. Yet there are some who have regressed in their later years! We should not think that our worth before God today will necessarily be maintained forever. It is possible that our spiritual condition may regress!</P><P>The worth of those between twenty and sixty years old was highest among all four groups. Not only so, God mentioned this group of people first in this portion of the Bible. What is the reason? This is because those who are twenty years and over are able fighters (Num. 1:3). When the twelve tribes were enumerated in Numbers 1, emphasis was put on the number of people who were over twenty years old and able to go forth to war. God's evaluation of His people today is the same. Whosoever is willing to consecrate is of worth before God. No matter how weak that person is, he will not be worthless. However, those who are willing to stand up for God's glory, who are willing to be one with God to destroy the evils, and who are willing to fight against Satan for God's rights, are of more worth than other believers. God's eyes are focused on the fighters.</P><P>Why is there a difference between the value of the male and the value of the female? This does not refer to the physical distinction (although for the Israelites it was according to the physical distinction), but to the strength or weakness of the spiritual life (1 Pet. 3:7). It is possible for one who has been saved for only one year to have more growth than another who has been saved for five years!</P><P>We know that there are differences in spiritual age among Christians, and there is the possibility of falling behind and also of advancing forward. In which condition are we?</P><P>"But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him" (Lev. 27:8). What does this mean? According to our spiritual age, we should offer a certain amount. But once we come under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, we know that we do not have much to offer. We cannot afford what we should pay! At that time we can only come again to our High Priest and admit that we cannot afford it and ask Him to reevaluate us. We have to start all over again.</P><P>The weighing of silver is according to the shekel of the sanctuary. This means you are worth exactly how much God says you are worth; none can be more accurate than that. Our standard is not accurate, but the standard of the sanctuary is extremely accurate. What God values cannot be wrong by even one thousandth of a grain.</P><P>Our half shekel for salvation has been paid. Today we all should ask God, "O God! What is my value in Your hands?"</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REDEEMING THE TIME</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting, Given in Shanghai<br>on January 13, 1931)<br>Issue No. 13</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gal. 6:10; Eph. 5:16; 4:27; Rom. 13:14</H1><P>Today is the first Lord's Day of the new year. Therefore, let us listen to what the Bible has to say. Even though we do not care about the so-called new year, we should have a new impression whenever a new year comes. Even though to a Christian the new year is nothing, we should always have a new beginning whenever a new year comes. In the Old Testament there is also the record of the new year. Moreover, in the Old Testament the month and the day for the beginning of the new year were ordained by God. Hence, today we want to consider this matter. Whether or not you are a Christian, as the years pass by, do you have any special feelings or impressions, or do the years mean anything special to you? I do not know what you think, but for me, every year means a little more opportunity. To lose the opportunity is to miss the time. Today, whether or not you are a Christian, the first question to ask yourself is whether you have missed your opportunity.</P><P>One proverb says, "Opportunity enters by the door, but flies out through the window." This is true. You have to open the door to invite the opportunity to come in, but it can go out without waiting for you to open the door. Therefore, for those who are here, if you are not saved, you should seek the opportunity to be saved. If you are already saved, you should seek the opportunity to serve the Lord; you should seek the opportunity to love others, and you should seek the opportunity to save men.</P><P>We have just read the phrase, "redeeming the time" (Eph. 5:16). Redeeming in the original text means "buying back." Brothers and sisters, God gives us time. It is like capital to a businessman. Time is our capital. Perhaps year after year you have done many things which are excellent, or perhaps year after year, as a businessman who has suffered loss, you have just been wasting your time away. Perhaps some have had few opportunities but they have accomplished much, or some have had many opportunities yet they have not accomplished anything. However, this year we have to redeem our time. God has given us time and expects us to make good use of it in the same way that businessmen make good use of their capital. May we all use our time properly, and may we not allow it to pass by vainly and to become wasted.</P><P>Galatians 6:10 says, "So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith." Whenever there is the opportunity, we should do good. We should take care of this matter. If there is no opportunity, obviously there is no way to do good. However, when there is the opportunity, there is no more excuse for us not to do good. Today we shall briefly look at a few things which we should seize the opportunity to do:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOVE OUR LORD</H2><P>Brothers and sisters, do you remember the woman in Mark 14 who poured ointment from an alabaster flask on the head of the Lord? Regarding this event, the Lord spoke well of her in this way, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her" (v. 9). Why did she do this? The Lord said, "She has anointed My body beforehand for the burial" (v. 8). Oh, some disciples thought that Mary was too foolish. Why this waste? Why not use the three hundred or more denarii to give to the poor? What did the Lord say? He said, "For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have Me" (v. 7). The Lord meant that one has the opportunity to help the poor every day but that there would not always be an opportunity to anoint Him because He was going to die. Once today's opportunity is missed, there cannot be another opportunity of today. The year 1931 is the year 1931. Next year will not be the same as this year. Today is today; tomorrow is not today. Today will pass away. The Lord is coming back soon! Whatever you can do for the Lord today, you should do it while there is still today. By the time you come before the Lord and meet Him face to face, it will be too late to turn back to do anything else. Who can say that the Lord Jesus will not come this year? Who can say that the Lord Jesus will not come today? Perhaps the Lord will come today. Perhaps today is the very last opportunity. Therefore, we should consecrate to the Lord today. There is only today. On that day when you meet the Lord, even if you had ten thousand hearts, you would surely give all of them to the Lord. Even if there were ten thousand worlds, you would gladly forsake them all. But it would be too late, for you would have missed your opportunity. You should serve the Lord while you still have the opportunity.</P><P>Why is there a difference between the five foolish virgins and the five prudent virgins in Matthew 25:2? What is the difference between the prudent and the foolish? They bore the same name-virgins. The oil was the same; they all took lamps. Their goal was the same, which was to go forth to meet the bridegroom. They heard the same cry; they arose the same way. What was the difference between them? Perhaps some would say that the foolish ones took the lamps but did not prepare the oil; the prudent ones took the lamps and also prepared the oil in the vessels. No doubt this is true, and I have not forgotten this. But I would say that the foolish ones also prepared the oil in the vessels; only they went to buy it later (v. 10). What is the main difference between them? This difference is that the five prudent virgins had their oil beforehand, before the coming of the bridegroom. The five foolish virgins had their oil afterward, after the coming of the bridegroom. There was oil, but it was bought after the bridegroom had come; the time had already passed. The question is not one of having or not having but one of timing. Time is a big question. The foolish ones are the ones who lose the opportunities.</P><P>A certain believer gave a gospel tract to an unbeliever in the park. That person, after reading it, said that it was something of Christianity and was sheer nonsense. This believer told him, "Even though today you do not believe in this, there will be a day when you have to believe that this is true. By the time you go to hell, you will believe. Everyone in hell believes, but the believing will come too late." What he said was true. Furthermore, the same is true for Christians. It is not that things are not done, but that they are done too late. An unbeliever can lose his opportunity, and a believer can also lose his opportunity.</P><P>I remember a story which goes something like this. There was a certain young man who had just started in the Lord's work. He prayed that God would give him a vision so that he would know how to labor. He had a dream in which he was advanced in years and was being judged in front of God. God said that on a certain day, at a certain time, he should have gained many people, but that he let the opportunity go and not many people were saved, and that on another day, at another time, he should have preached to a certain person, but that he let the opportunity go and did not preach. God said further that on yet a third certain day at a certain time, he should have done good to a certain person, but that he let the opportunity go again and did not do so. In every case, it was concerning a certain day and a certain time in which something should have been done, but the opportunity was missed. The believer then asked God for another opportunity to make up for this lack. At this point he woke up. He was relieved that this was only a dream and that everything was not over.</P><P>Oh, if there can be any regret in heaven, the only regret will be the loss of opportunity! If there will be regret in hell, the only regret will also be the loss of opportunity! Oh, when a sinner misses his opportunity, he will not be saved! When a believer misses his opportunity, he will not be able to serve the Lord fully! Only one week has passed by this year. Fortunately, there are still fifty-one weeks left. May we all not miss the opportunity.</P><P>There is a custom in Italy that when a girl is married, she receives a pocket. Every year on the first day of the first month, she must go to pick a rose and put it in this pocket. When she dies, this pocket full of roses will become her pillow in the coffin. The sweet scent of the roses collected throughout the years is thought to remain fragrant for her for eternity. As we go through life day after day, we should also pick our roses, so that their sweet scent will remain with us for eternity. We should redeem our time and not lose our opportunity. If you are not a Christian and allow your days to pass by one after another, there will surely be a day when you will regret that you have not been saved. If you are a Christian and allow your days to pass by one after another, there will surely be a day when you will regret that you have not served the Lord fully.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO GOOD</H2><P>Not only do we need to seek the opportunity to love the Lord, we should also seek the opportunity to do good. Brothers and sisters, what do you think to do good means? What is the best kindness and goodness? I think it is said best in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. There is one English version which translates these few verses in a particular way with particular significance. Today let me read this translation to you:</P><P>"Love is very patient, very kind. Love knows no jealousy; love makes no parade, gives itself no airs, is never rude, never selfish, never irritated, never resentful; love is never glad when others go wrong, love is gladdened by goodness, always slow to expose, always eager to believe the best, always hopeful, always patient" (from The New Testament, a new translation by James Moffatt).</P><P>This is a very meaningful passage. It is our weakness to rejoice when others go wrong, but love will never be glad. "Covers" in "covers all things" is the same word as "roof" in Mark 2:4 in the original text. To cover means not to remove other people's roofs. To remove the roof is to uncover other people's affairs. Love is not like this. Love always hopes for others' good. Love always has trust in the good aspects of others. It is our weakness to think that others are not as good. How did Paul commend Philemon? "Hearing of your love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints" (Philem. 5). Philemon not only had faith in the Lord; he also had faith in all the saints. This is what we need. We should earnestly believe in the goodness of others.</P><P>We have read Galatians 6:10. This verse tells us that as we have opportunity, let us do good. What God requires of us today is that we do good while there is the opportunity. In regard to doing good, I have to mention a few points.</P><P>First, I need to talk about forgiving others. We should realize that God gives us opportunities to forgive others. These opportunities to forgive others will pass away. Perhaps in the twinkling of an eye you will die or he will die. Brothers and sisters, I do not know if anyone among us today is unwilling to forgive others. If there are some, please forgive now. If you wait until later, the opportunity may be gone.</P><P>There was a Western couple who once quarreled at home. Later on the husband, seeing that it was time to go to work, held his wife's hand before he left, said good-bye to her, kissed her, and asked her for forgiveness. His wife ignored him and was unwilling to forgive him. At noon the police suddenly brought her husband home; he was already dead, covered with blood. When his wife saw this, she said, "O God! If I had known that he would come back like this, surely I would not have let him leave the way he did! Oh, the opportunity is gone!" Brothers and sisters, once you realize that opportunities will pass by, can you afford not to find the opportunity to forgive others?</P><P>Second, we should do our best to love others. There was a wife who had died. Her husband carefully put a bunch of flowers into her hand. A little child, leaning against the wall, said coldly, "This is the first time he gave flowers to her." Oh, if you give someone flowers when he is dead, why do you not give him flowers while he is still alive? I have seen many people neglected when they were alive, but when they died people sent them flowers! We should do good when there is still the opportunity. Many people are waiting for us to do good to them. One poem says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>O friends,<br>I beg thee tonight,<br>Withhold not thy kisses<br>From my chilly forehead.<br>How lonely is the pathway!<br>Let me feel thy closeness now.<br>May you think warmly of me!<br>Traveling over land and sea,<br>My strength is withdrawn from me;<br>My trembling feet,<br>Full of scars of thorns.<br>Forgive me! O cold heart!<br>Forgive me!<br>In that future dreamless rest,<br>Will I still need the love which<br>I long for tonight?</P><P>Many believers and many of God's children are waiting for our help. There is one thing among us which I feel is not good. The modernists speak much with their mouths concerning service, but they do not serve. This obviously is not good. But for us, we have neglected too much the matter of doing good and helping others. This is most pitiful. We should seek for opportunities to do good to others. Two years ago there was an unusual article in the news in the United States. A man had gone to work in some place. After he finished his work, he took a train home. When he was not far away from his home, he made a long distance telephone call to his wife, which cost him thirteen dollars and sixty-five cents. When his wife answered the call, she thought that he was in danger. However, he said only, "I still love you." His wife marveled that he would spend so much money to say these few words. When he reached home, his wife asked him concerning this. He replied, "I was afraid that I might die on the way and not reach home. So I called first to tell you those words."</P><P>There was a woman who suffered from tuberculosis and was about to die. Her husband was there and the doctor told him that his wife was dying. The husband then spoke to his wife, "If you die, I do not know what I will do because I really love you." His wife replied, "Everything would have been fine if you had told me this earlier." She said this because his conduct toward her before had caused her to doubt his love and had depressed her to the point that she had fallen sick.</P><P>Mr. Panton said, "Take the opportunity today to speak a little word of kindness, a word of praise, and a word of appreciation."</P><P>There was a very famous literary person in England. His relationship with his wife had been cold for many years. One day, his wife died. When he arrived home he spoke to the dead body, "I wish you had lived for another five minutes so that I could have had the opportunity to tell you that even though our relationship was so distant these many years, my heart has never left you."</P><P>If we do not take the opportunity to love others today and to do good to them, we will regret it one day. May we learn to forgive others today, and may we learn to love others and to speak a kind word to them today.</P><P>Third, we have to help other people with our money. A rich man said, "Whenever there is money it should be given away." Do not think that your money can be saved for some better use in the future, and that you will give more money when there is a better use. Actually, the "good use" of the present time is better than the "better use" of the future. Many people want to save fifty or a hundred dollars and take it out when there is a real need. But I must tell you that you may not be able to take it out on that day. Why not give the ten, twenty, or thirty cents to the beggar today? Perhaps when the real need comes, it will already be too late.</P><P>What does it say in the Gospel of Luke concerning the deeds of the unfaithful steward? He took advantage of his position while he was still the steward to speak to the man that owed his master a hundred measures of oil, "Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty" (16:6). And to the one who owed his master one hundred measures of wheat he said, "Take your bill and write eighty" (v. 7). He did not wait until he was out of his stewardship to do all this. To wait until he was no longer the steward would have been too late. Through this incident, the Lord taught the disciples to seize the opportunity to gain friends, that is, friends in eternity. Brothers and sisters, this is what we should learn today. Take the opportunity today to use the three or five dollars you still possess for the work of the Lord, for the poor believers, and for the poor. In the streets we meet poor people; in the meetings we come across poor believers. If we have the ability, we should take the opportunity to do good to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. NOT LEAVING THE OPPORTUNITY</H2><P>The above speaks of taking the opportunity. There is also another aspect, which is what Romans 13:14 says: "Make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts," and what Ephesians 4:27 says, "Neither give place to the devil." Not only do we have to seize the opportunity, but we have to avoid giving opportunity. Not only do we have to take the opportunity to love God and man, but we should not give any opportunity to the flesh or the devil.</P><P>The cause of the sin of the first man was due to his speaking a word incorrectly. If we do not wish to give any opportunity to the flesh or to the devil, there is only one way, which is to say "no." If we say "no" the right way, everything will be well, but if we say it the wrong way, we will fail. For example, if a young man was invited out to carouse with others, and his first word was "no," everything would be fine. I have a younger brother whose friends often invited him to play. I told him that he did not have to involve himself with whatever was wrong. He only muttered something without saying yes or no. If you can say "no" as the first word, the second word will be easy, and the third will be even easier. If you dare not say "no" on the first hand, your heart is shaken already. Initially, your conscience may not agree; but in the end you may not even care for your conscience anymore. If you do not resist the first time, you will fail the second and third time. Many people overcome because they will say "no" the first time. These people will not be sought after by others because the others know that they will refuse anyway. Many brothers and sisters fail because they will not say "no" at the beginning. Therefore they are wearing what they should not wear, eating what they should not eat, doing what they should not do, and going where they should not go.</P><P>Two weeks ago I read a magazine in which an old man wrote an article which said that if a young man does not know how to say "no," he should go to the wilderness and repeatedly say "no" until his tongue obeys him and is able to say "no." Of course, when we say "no," we should be polite, courteous, and respectful.</P><P>In the Bible there was a man who certainly knew how to say "no." That was John the Baptist. When the Jews sent some to ask him whether or not he was the Christ, he replied, "No." Because of such a clear word, a great deal of trouble was avoided. If he had replied a little ambiguously, he would have been able to gain a little glory. But he preferred to lower his status by saying "no," saving himself a great deal of trouble. Eve failed because she spoke one word after another. I know a number of brothers and sisters who fell because they could not say the first word, "no." In the end, it was too late even when they wanted to say "no."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MEN</H2><P>Not only should we seize opportunity, we should also not give any opportunity for the flesh to make provision for itself, and we should not give any place to the devil. Besides this, we should also seek for opportunities to save men. There was a man from England who was well-known for saving souls. When he was dying, he spoke the following words, "I can see that not everyone will go to hell. If I did not see this, I would not be able to sleep in peace." The time is late. Brothers and sisters, may we see that if a sinner passes by, he is gone forever. The Bible teaches us to do good to all men, that is, to do good to those we meet.</P><P>There was a preacher who spoke a certain message in his first year of preaching, and in his fiftieth year he spoke the same message. However, there were only five men who had heard his message fifty years earlier. Perhaps the people you meet in a train will not see you again. If you do not give out tracts and do not testify, your opportunity will pass away.</P><P>Mr. Moody was preaching at one time in a chapel in Chicago. At the end of the meeting he said, "Friends, if there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord today and has not repented, I hope that you will come again." That same evening, there was a big fire in Chicago. Even the chapel was burned down. Afterward, Mr. Moody preached again in a rebuilt wooden house. At the beginning of his speaking, he wept because those who were there that day were not the same ones who had attended the previous meeting. From then on, Mr. Moody always exhorted the people to believe immediately and not wait for another time because there might not be another time.</P><P>We still have fifty-one weeks before us this year. May we not lose the opportunity to love God, to love man, and to save souls.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. A FEW WORDS TO THE SINNERS</H2><P>To those who are here and have not believed in the Lord, let me say a few words. I advise you not to say that there is still much time, that there are many opportunities, and that you can take your time to consider. Have you not suffered enough from sins? In the Bible there is a record of a king called Pharaoh. He hardened his heart, and God caused frogs to enter into his house. He went to plead with a servant of God called Moses that God would cause the frogs to depart from him. The servant of God asked, "When shall I entreat for thee,...to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses?" He said, "Tomorrow" (Exo. 8:9-10). Are you not surprised with his answer? He still wanted to stay with the frogs another night and smell the bad odor another night. He said, "Tomorrow"; he wanted to wait until the next day. Many people think, "I have sinned; I do not have peace, but I think that I still have the opportunity. I still want to suffer another night and commit sins another day." But I tell you that such a matter cannot wait till the next day. Whenever there is an opportunity, you must plead with God. Salvation is a matter of this life, and salvation is a matter for today. If you wait for another day, you may not have the opportunity anymore. If you have already heard the gospel and know that Jesus has died for you and has resurrected for you, and if you still want to wait a while before you believe, I advise you to believe now because you may not have another opportunity.</P><P>Once I was preaching in a certain girls' school in Nanking. A student whose father worked for the government held strongly to her anti-Christian thoughts. After I had spoken for a few days, I invited those who had questions to ask them. She stood up and said, "I know that I must believe in Jesus, and I also know that Jesus is my Savior. But a minute ago, you told us that a robber believed right before he died. I want to wait until I am about to die before I believe." I replied, "Certainly, a man can be saved if he believes in the Lord right before he dies. However, I have three questions to ask you. First, do you know when you will die? How do you know at any time if you are going to die and that you should believe in Jesus then? Can you say that you will believe today and that you will die tomorrow? Second, can you say that you will die slowly, and that there will be sufficient time for you to believe? Will you never be killed by a car or by a stray bullet? Can you guarantee that your death will be a slow one and that you will have opportunity to believe in the Lord? Third, you can say today that you should believe in Jesus and that you have indeed sinned, but can you be sure that on the day you die you will still have this intention? Even if you knew that the time of your death was near, can you say that you would surely believe and that you would surely want to believe? If you are waiting for the right opportunity, I am afraid that the time will pass you by. You have sinned, and the Lord Jesus has already borne your sins; He has died for you on the cross and has already resurrected and ascended. I hope that you will not wait for tomorrow. I know what I am talking about because I have been at the side of dead men. I have seen many people who have said in the morning that they were not ready to die yet, but in the same afternoon they were not afraid anymore because they had already believed in Jesus."</P><P>Let me come back to the friend whom I mentioned earlier, who gave out tracts at the park. When an unbeliever saw the tract and despised it as being nonsense, her reply was very good. She said, "From my childhood my temper was very bad. After I believed in the Lord, I changed. Not only does my family say that I am a good person, even my teacher says the same thing. Sir, is this also nonsense? When my mother died, I saw that she passed away peacefully and joyfully. Sir, is this also nonsense? Many of my brothers and friends, like you, believe neither in eternity nor in heaven or hell, but they are not satisfied. They sinned; they fell sick; they are sorrowful. Sir, is this also nonsense? If there is such a big difference between believing and not believing, I am willing to be deceived even if it is `nonsense' to you. You think that this is nonsense only because you do not know God."</P><P>I hope that today no Christian would lose any opportunity. Moreover, I hope that none would give any opportunity to the flesh and the devil. I also hope that today there is not a sinner who would lose the opportunity of salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>This issue of Notes on Scriptural Messages contains a message released in the meeting on the afternoon of the first Lord's Day of this year.

Today I am going to talk about the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Christian. There is one item concerning the Holy Spirit which I would ask you to pay special attention to. Many people think that after a man is saved, he still needs to seek the Holy Spirit. I will now prove whether or not this statement is true. Please do not believe something just because I have said it. One must see what the Bible says, for only the word of the Bible is reliable.</P><P>Let us consider Ephesians 1:13: "In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation." What is the word of the truth? It is the gospel of salvation. After we hear the gospel, we believe in Christ. What we believe is a person, Christ, and not a doctrine or a theory. The word of the truth tells us about the Christ who can save us. Its aim is to bring us to have faith in Christ through the hearing of the gospel; its purpose is not to bring us to have faith in some gospel sermons or some doctrines written on pieces of paper. The latter are not the genuine thing and will not save us. What we hear is the word of the truth, the gospel of our salvation. What we believe is Christ. Therefore, the first step is that we hear the word of the truth, the gospel of our salvation, and the second step is that we believe in Christ.</P><P>After a person has heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ, he is "sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise." The words "you were sealed" are very important. It means at that moment when one believes, he receives the Holy Spirit of promise. It does not mean that one has to wait for a while; it does not mean that one has to wait for three days, five days, or for some time before he can receive the Holy Spirit. When the Bible tells us that "you were sealed," it means "you were sealed." Brothers and sisters, while you are sitting here, I would like to ask if you have heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ. If your answer is yes, do you not think that you have the Holy Spirit? The Bible tells us that "you were sealed"; the Holy Spirit dwells in the believers like the sealing of a seal. Do we have the Holy Spirit? Let me say this. Even if you are a backsliding or very bad Christian, the Holy Spirit is still dwelling in you in the same way that he is dwelling in other believers. In a minute I will show you the difference between a sanctified believer's feeling and an unsanctified believer's feeling towards the Holy Spirit; I will show you the difference between an obedient believer's feeling and a disobedient believer's feeling toward the Holy Spirit. However, whether it is the sanctified believer or unsanctified believer, the obedient one or disobedient one, the Holy Spirit dwells in them all; there is no difference, and there is no distinction whatsoever. Even though there may be differences in other matters, there is no difference as far as the Holy Spirit dwelling in them as a seal. If you have heard the gospel and have believed in Christ, the Holy Spirit will dwell in you in the same way He dwells in other believers. But if you have not believed in Christ, there will surely be a difference. It does not matter what kind of a person one is, whether he lives a good life or a bad one, whether he is advancing or backsliding, obedient or disobedient to God; there is no difference between them. If you think that you have the Holy Spirit because you obey God, love Him, have a joyful feeling, see some visions or some tongues of fire, etc., and that, unless you have these things, you do not have the Holy Spirit, you are in a heresy. Whoever believes in the Lord has the Holy Spirit. At the time we believe, the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</P><P>Here it says that one receives "the Holy Spirit of the promise" (v. 13). What is a "promise"? The whole book of Galatians tells us that a "promise" is something received freely. A "promise" is of grace; it is not a wage. It is given to us freely by God. Most people do not understand why every Christian, that is, every saved person, has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. They think that their spiritual condition must reach a certain level before the Holy Spirit will dwell in them. Yet the Bible reveals that the Holy Spirit dwells in us because of the work of the Lord Jesus' redemption and not because of our own work. We can understand this by looking at one of the types in the Old Testament. Leviticus 14:25 says, "Then he shall slaughter the lamb of the trespass offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot." What happened after this? Following this, verse 28 says, "Then the priest shall put some of the oil which is in his palm on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot-upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering." Those who received the application of the blood received the anointing of the oil. Where there is no blood, there is no oil. The oil is put upon a person after the blood is first put upon him. The Holy Spirit comes down because the blood is there already. God pours down the Holy Spirit of promise not because of our good behavior, but because of the blood. Therefore, all those who have heard the word of the truth and believed in Christ have received the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE HOLY SPIRIT AS A SEAL</H2><P>What does the last part of verse 13 tell us about the Holy Spirit? It is like a "seal." Thank God that the Holy Spirit is like a "seal." Brothers and sisters, do you know why the sealing is needed and what "the seal" means? Second Timothy 2:19 says, "Having this seal, [1] The Lord knows those who are His, and, [2] Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness." Therefore, there are two meanings to the sealing. First, once something is sealed, it signifies that the thing belongs to the man who sealed it. Second, what is being sealed bears the resemblance of the seal. "The Lord knows those who are His," indicates that all those who are sealed by the Lord belong to Him. "And, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness," indicates that all those sealed by the Lord should bear His image. The first meaning of the sealing is that we belong to the Lord. The second meaning is that we are the same as the Lord and bear His image. For instance, when I put a seal on an envelope with sealing wax, the seal on the envelope is just like my seal. Sometimes we see sons that look like their fathers and daughters that look like their mothers. We say that they must have come out of the same mold. This is the second meaning of the Holy Spirit as a seal. Therefore, the Holy Spirit as a seal tells us two things. First, I belong to Him; second, I should bear His image, for He is holy.</P><P>The Ephesians understood the Holy Spirit as a seal much better than we do, for their city was engaged in lumber business. Ephesus was close to a harbor, and the trees were cut on the mountain and floated downstream to the harbor. Once I read a book about Ephesus. It said that many merchants went there to buy lumber. Each of them brought with him a different seal of iron, like a hammer. When they completed negotiation on a load of lumber, each of them would seal the lumber he bought with his own hammer-seal before he went home. It did not matter if they did not come back after three or five months; some did not have need for the lumber right away. Whenever they wanted their lumber, they would send their men to get it, bringing along the hammer-seal used previously. They only needed to compare the seals on the wood with their own seal. All the pieces that had their seal belonged to them, and they could take them away. No mistake could be made this way. This is the way the lumber merchants in Foochow conducted business also. They would buy the lumber in the upper part of the Ming River and seal it with their hammer-seals. Then the wood would be floated down the Ming River to Foochow. There the buyers would come and check their purchase by comparing it with their seal.</P><P>God has not only sealed us with the Holy Spirit as a seal, indicating that we belong to Him now, but has also told us that we are sealed unto the day of redemption. Hence, Ephesians 4:30 says, "You were sealed unto the day of redemption." It does not say "for a while" but "unto the day of redemption." What does "the day of redemption" refer to? It refers to the day our body is redeemed and raptured. When the Lord comes to reap and rapture the believers, there will be some in Shanghai, some in Southeast Asia, some in China, some in England, some in Africa, and some elsewhere. How can the Lord recognize His people? It is by the seal. The seal is just for the day of redemption. Where there is the seal, there will be no confusion and no mistake. God is like the lumber merchant. He only accepts those who belong to Him according to His seal. Those without the Holy Spirit are not His, and He will not accept them. Those with the Holy Spirit are His, and He will reap, raise them up, and take them home at the proper time. (Here, we will not cover the matter of the times and the order of rapture, for it is beyond the scope of this subject.) Our Christian life begins with salvation and ends with our redemption. From the beginning to the end, the Holy Spirit is always like a seal. The Holy Spirit is the seal of God. The Holy Spirit is not the sealer but the seal. It is God who puts the Holy Spirit into us as a seal. If you have not believed in the Lord Jesus, your position is very dangerous. If you have believed in the Lord Jesus as Savior and as Lord, no matter if you are a new believer or have been a believer for a long time, you are safe and sound, for the Holy Spirit is dwelling in you. How long will this indwelling last? It will last unto the day of redemption. Some may think that if they are not good, if they stumble, or if they commit sins, the Holy Spirit will cease to dwell in them. But the Bible says, "Unto the day of redemption." There is something called "the chart of the heart" printed by some churches. It contains some excellent truths. But its teaching concerning the Holy Spirit is completely wrong. It shows the Holy Spirit as a dove which flies away when a believer commits a serious sin, and man's heart is left without the Holy Spirit but with the devil and all kinds of lust. This is a great mistake. The Bible tells us very clearly that in the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit dwells in us unto the day of redemption; He never leaves us halfway through. Once God seals us with the Holy Spirit, it indicates that we belong to Him; it means that we will belong to Him forever, and this fact can never be changed.</P><P>But this is not all. There is another very glorious gift, which is that we can have the power to be like Him. When God seals us, not only does it indicate that we belong to Him, but that we, the sealed ones, bear the image of His seal. We know that if we put a seal on soft wax, it will naturally bear the image of the seal. When we are sealed within by God with the Holy Spirit, we will have God's nature and life. Such a nature and life are God-like. If we live according to them, we will have a living on earth that is God-like.</P><P>Many people are misled to think that they should try to improve and cultivate themselves and work hard before they can be like God, but this is not true. At the time we are saved, God has already made us like Him and given us something of Himself in our inner being. God has never commanded us to be like Him, because it is impossible for us to do it by ourselves. Yet we do have our responsibility, which is to express this image and not allow it to be covered by anything of the world. What a glorious truth that God's seal is in us! By this seal, that is, the Holy Spirit, we can live out God's life. With such a provision, nothing is impossible! Now we must realize that in us there is a treasure out of which we can bring forth many precious things.</P><P>As those who have the seal of God, our only responsibilities are, on the one hand, to reckon ourselves as being dead to sin and believe that everything that is against such an image has been dealt with by the Lord's cross. On the other hand, we have to consecrate ourselves to God and let the Holy Spirit live out God's life. When we fail and stumble, we still have not lost the image given by God's seal; we have only covered up this image and not lived out a life that is of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING AN EARNEST</H2><P>Now let us look at verse 14: "Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory." Paul told us in verse 13 that the Holy Spirit has sealed us. First, this indicates that we belong to God and, second, it makes us like God. He told us in verse 14 that the Holy Spirit is like a pledge (or what we commonly know as a deposit). What does this mean? Paul told us not only that the Holy Spirit has sealed us, but also that the Holy Spirit was given as a pledge, a deposit. In the original language, deposit means an actual deposit and a sample.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Deposit</H2><P>What is a "deposit"? Suppose I am buying a piece of land for two thousand dollars. I pay one hundred dollars in advance as a deposit. This means that the seller receives one hundred dollars first, and I give him the balance later. I only pay him a portion at first, while I must pay the balance later. If I am faithful, I will pay him the balance of one thousand nine hundred dollars. God does likewise. He gives us the Holy Spirit as a pledge. This means that He gives to us part of the heavenly blessing first as a guarantee that He will give us all the heavenly inheritance later. God puts Himself in a legally unchangeable position. He has paid the deposit and must therefore pay the whole later. God's Holy Spirit is the guarantee of His promise. The Bible says that we, the believers, will receive much in abundance. Yet, how do we know He will carry out His word? We know it through the Holy Spirit. God makes the Holy Spirit a deposit and proves to us that none of His promise will fail. Since God has given us the Holy Spirit as a "deposit," He is saying to us through the Holy Spirit that all of His will be ours. Once He does this, it becomes impossible for Him to change. Is there anyone in the world who has paid a deposit and will not pay the rest unless he is dishonest? God is faithful and righteous. Once He pays the deposit, He will surely pay the balance.</P><P>Mr. Philip Mauro said, "What is the deposit like? It is just like an engagement ring." It means that now your fianc&#233; gives you a small part, and that he will give you all that he has on the wedding day. Therefore, God gives us the Holy Spirit as a "deposit" indicating that all the riches in the heavens will be ours.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Sample</H2><P>People in ancient times had another custom. At the time of the sale of a piece of land, not only did the buyer pay some money as a deposit to the seller, but the seller also gave some of the soil as a sample to the buyer. This meant that the soil one received on that day would be the same as the soil he would receive in the future. God has given us the Holy Spirit not only as a deposit but also as a sample so that we can enjoy a foretaste of the heavenly things. By this, we know that what is given to us by God today will be the same in nature as what He will give to us in the future. If silver is given today, silver will be given in the future. If gold is given today, gold will be given in the future. God gives us the Holy Spirit today in order that we can have a foretaste of the heavenly things on earth today.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, have you ever tasted the heavenly things? The Bible tells us that Paul heard unspeakable words and tasted heavenly things. We fellowship with God, and we also fellowship with one another in the Lord. The Holy Spirit is the means through which we fellowship with God and by which we receive the heavenly joy and the bestowing of the Lord's love. When we come to the Lord, worship Him, or fellowship with one another, do we not feel the Lord's love and joy? This is the foretaste of the heavenly things! Once a brother talked about the Lord's love with me. He said, "When the Lord's love comes upon me, I cannot sit still. I want to go out and run for a while." What we taste today is good and rich. Yet in the future it will be better and richer. Sometimes we feel the Lord's love and joy burning within us like a fire. Yet what we taste today is still only a little. There will be much more in the future! What we taste today is just a little-a little today, a little tomorrow, and a little the day after. What we will taste in the future is not just this little. We cannot imagine how good it will be. It will be so good that we will say, "Even eternity is too short!"</P><P>We must remember that there are two meanings to the Holy Spirit being a deposit from God to us today. The first is that God gives us a part today and that He will give us the whole in the future. The other is that what God gives us today, He will give us in the future. When the spies of Israel cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes from the brook of Eshcol, and two carried it, they told Moses, "We came to the land to which you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit" (Num. 13:27). This cluster of grapes indicated the nature of the land of Canaan. Surely it flowed with milk and honey! The Holy Spirit dwelling in us is also like this cluster of grapes. The taste today is just like what the heavenly taste will be in the future. We thank and praise God that He has given us the Holy Spirit, not only as our deposit, guaranteeing that He will give us the whole, but as a foretaste of the heavenly things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GRIEVING NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>What we have covered thus far is the grace of God that has been given to us. Now we will consider the responsibility that we should bear. Let us read Ephesians 4:30: "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption." Paul exhorted us with the fact that the Holy Spirit is a seal. He meant that since we have the Holy Spirit as a seal, we should not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</P><P>What does "grieve" mean? Does it say here, "Let not the Holy Spirit of God be angry"? No, it does not say this. The Bible clearly says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God." It is not "being angry with," but "grieve." This is a matter of love! Where there is hatred, there is anger. One cannot make the Holy Spirit of God angry, but one can grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We thank and praise God for the Holy Spirit of God within us only grieves; He never becomes angry through hatred. No matter how bad we are, the Holy Spirit only "grieves"; He does not become angry. I have heard someone say, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit to the point that He runs away." This is impossible. When Paul said, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God," he continued immediately with, "In whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption." No Christians can pray as David did: "Do not take the Spirit of Your holiness away from me" (Psa. 51:11). This is a prayer of the Old Testament age. No one in the New Testament can ever pray this prayer. No Christian, rightly taught, would pray like this. If a Christian knows the gospel, he would never pray such a prayer. Since the Holy Spirit can never run away, Paul entreated the believers in Ephesus, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit." When a person is not good, others will either become angry with him or run away from him. Man may become angry or run away, but the Holy Spirit will never run away. The Holy Spirit can only grieve. If He could run away, He would not have to grieve. The Holy Spirit cannot become angry because He loves you! Neither can the Holy Spirit run away because He loves you! Therefore, you should not grieve Him.</P><P>What does "grieve" mean? It is the same word as "sorrowful" in Matthew 26:37. Brothers and sisters, what kind of sorrow is this sorrow? It is the sorrow of our Lord Jesus at Gethsemane when God put upon Him all sins; He was exceedingly sorrowful even unto death. If a Christian becomes weak and commits sins, the indwelling Holy Spirit will be sorrowful as the Lord was sorrowful even unto death. He will continually grieve within us. We should know that this is not a small thing. The Holy Spirit within us can be in either of two states: He can either be happy or sorrowful. Therefore, we should ask ourselves whether the indwelling Holy Spirit is happy or sorrowful. If He is not happy, He must be sorrowful. We can make Him either happy or sorrowful. May God enlighten us to know ourselves and see how rebellious, sinful, and evil we are. Yet the Holy Spirit never becomes angry within us, and He never runs away from us. He loves us and would only grieve within us.</P><P>When the Lord was at Gethsemane, He said to the disciples, "So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?" (Matt. 26:40b). The Lord's sorrow was just for a while or for one hour. But the Holy Spirit dwells within us unto the day of redemption. As such, His sorrow is an enduring one. The sorrow of our Lord Jesus was over after a while, but the Holy Spirit is under the pressure of our sins moment by moment and day after day. If we disobey Him and refuse to listen to His voice all the time, do we realize how much He grieves within us? I do not know whether the Holy Spirit is happy or sorrowful in you. But you should know that either you are making Him happy, or you are making Him sorrowful.</P><P>What makes the Holy Spirit sorrowful? It is sins! Offenses against others, filthiness, fondness in criticisms, stealing of others' secrets and gossiping about them, finding fault with others, not forgiving others, not being faithful to the work of the Lord, to ones' own family, or to all things, inability to love others, or hunting for opportunity to profit oneself-these sins will grieve the Holy Spirit within us! Not only do sins grieve Him, even our disobedience to God's will, the choosing of our own way, or taking the wrong way, also grieves Him! This is not all. Young Christians who love the world, who are reluctant to give up the world, to suffer, to testify for the Lord, or who do not care for the souls of sinners but have a cold heart, not caring if others are saved or perishing, also grieve the Holy Spirit!</P><P>You can grieve the Holy Spirit, but He will never leave, and He never becomes angry. He loves you. This is why He is sorrowful in you! Sometimes you may say, "Why am I not happy?" Let me tell you: if the Holy Spirit is not happy, you cannot be happy. If the Holy Spirit is happy, you can be happy. If the Holy Spirit grieves, how can you be happy? Even if you have worldly happiness, you cannot make the Holy Spirit within you happy. If you know what you must do, yet you do not do it according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, you will grieve the Holy Spirit within you, and you cannot be genuinely happy. You can only have "joy in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 14:17). If the Holy Spirit does not rejoice in you, you cannot rejoice in Him either.</P><P>May God enlighten us today to truly know that the Holy Spirit is like a seal and a deposit. Our responsibility on earth today is not to grieve the Holy Spirit. This is what we should be watchful to do everyday. May God bless us!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO RESTS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given in Shanghai on April 24, 1931)<br>Issue No. 15</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 11:20-30</H1><P>Although I read this long portion of the word today, now I will only pay special attention to three verses. They are verses 28, 29, and 30, which say, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</P><P>In this portion of the word, the Lord Jesus spoke about His own feeling. Before He spoke this word, He had been provoked greatly. Something happened which provoked the Lord. He had performed many mighty works and miracles in different cities, especially in three big cities-Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. He had helped many people and healed many sick ones in the cities. However, the end result was that "they did not repent" (v. 20). Regardless of how they had heard and known that the Lord Jesus was the One descended from heaven to be the Savior and the Messiah, they would not repent or believe. They could say things with their mouths, but within their hearts they still did not believe nor repent. When they did this, everything that the Lord had done became vain. Therefore, Matthew presented to us here the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P><P>Let us consider the first words in verse 25: "At that time." It was under this kind of situation the Lord Jesus prayed. The Lord prayed to the Father and said, "I extol You, Father, ...because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." The people in the big city considered themselves to be clever and wise. That was why they could not receive the Lord Jesus. Although the Lord desired to see the people in the big city getting saved, He was more pleased to obey the will of God. Therefore, even though He was rejected by them, He could say to God, "I extol You, Father,...because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." Under the most difficult and disappointing time, He could still focus and delight in God's will. He did not care for His own will and said, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." He did not say "no" but "yes." At any time He could still say, "Yes, Father," because He only minded the good will of the Father. He knew that "all things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." Therefore, the people in the big cities may not have known the Son and may not have repented, but His heart was fully satisfied. Here is the reason and the secret why the Lord Jesus had peace in His heart and was unshaken by the environment. He rested by relying on His relationship with the Father. As long as the Father knew, it was enough. It was sufficient that there was only the Father's approval and praise. However people may have treated Him, it was not worthwhile for Him to be bothered or offended. As long as there was the smiling face of the Father and the carrying out of His will, it was good enough. There was no need to be concerned about the consequence among men in the world.</P><P>Before the Lord prayed, His circumstances were not good, and His background was not favorable. He was greatly misunderstood. He poured out everything to them wholeheartedly. However, they would not receive Him. They rejected Him without any reason. If it had happened to you or me, I am afraid that we would be like John, asking God to send down fire to consume them. If we were in the Lord's situation, we would have wondered why we should encounter such events. We would be murmuring and would have no peace. However, although the Lord was so greatly misunderstood, He only said, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." If we were in this kind of situation, we would have no peace in our heart, and we would be in turmoil. Even if we were not in turmoil, we would be doubting. Even if we were not doubting, we would be unhappy. However, the Lord said, "I extol You, Father." Within His heart there was no unrest. In verse 27 He reveals to us the secret of His restfulness. What was spoken before this verse was the background, which explains how the Lord could be at rest and not be moved in His heart in this kind of situation. Now He tells us the reason why He was not affected. In verses 28  and 29, the Lord shows us what we should do in order to be at rest if we encounter the same treatment. Today we want to speak on these two verses of the Bible. There is a difference between verses 28 and 29. Verse 28 speaks of one kind of rest, while verse 29 speaks of another kind of rest. The two rests are different, and one is deeper than the other.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REST OF SALVATION</H2><P>The rest in verse 28 is spoken of this way: "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." This rest is the rest of salvation. Verse 29 is the rest of victory. The first rest is the rest of being reconciled with God. The second rest is the rest within us. The first rest is the rest of our salvation. The second rest is our rest on earth.</P><P>"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened," Brothers and sisters, perhaps you do not realize what the world is. There are many people whose days on the earth are not many, yet they have much experience of the world. They would tell you that the world is in a fever. When I cross the big streets, I see many people walking to and fro. All of them are so busy. I would ask, "What are they doing? Are they mad?" I pity them. Probably the whole world is in a fever. Oh, they do not have rest. The Lord did not say here, "Come to Me all who are sinful and wicked, and I will give you rest." This is because the pleasure of sin is sweet, and a sinner desires to have more pleasure in sin. Therefore, the Lord used another term and said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." You are toiling, and you are burdened. Some people may feel that sin is pleasant and sweet. But everyone feels that he is toiling. Many people do not think that sin is painful. But everyone feels that their experiences are painful. Therefore, regardless if a person is a millionaire, a high-ranking person in the political world, a renowned scholar, a student, a businessman, a civilian, a coolie, or a beggar, no one is satisfied with himself. For a while I thought that those who pull rickshaws surely would sigh, but that millionaires do not need to sigh. However, one time when I was staying in a millionaire's home, I heard him sigh also. There is the pleasure of sin, but at the same time the labor of life makes a person sigh also. One time when I preached to an illiterate lady, she said, "Ah, unfortunately I do not know how to read; otherwise, I could believe and read the Bible." I thought if an illiterate lady would sigh, "Ah," perhaps a well-educated college professor would not sigh, "Ah." Actually, both sigh just the same. There was a foreign college professor in a certain school who was always very pessimistic. He always sighed, "Ah!" no matter what he saw. One day the sun was bright, the sky was clear, and the grass was green. The campus grounds were filled with the fragrance of flowers and the singing of birds. A few colleagues of the professor came to speak to him, saying, "See how wonderful today is? There is no need to sigh `Ah,' today." He looked at the sky and everything around him; there was indeed nothing for him to sigh about. But did he stop sighing? Not at all. In the end he said, "Ah, unfortunately this time will not last long. Ah!"</P><P>One can see men toiling and restless everywhere. All day long, they are unsettled in their worries. Where should they settle down? I am afraid that you are not at rest and are still laboring.</P><P>Many people feel the weight of their burden and the toil of their labor. They realize that they do not have rest. I did not realize how heavy a burden can be until one time when I went down to a village to preach the gospel. The village where I went was on the other side of a mountain, and no steamboat could get there. I traveled first by a small steamboat to one place. After getting off the boat, I had to walk over the mountain to reach that place. The weather was very hot at that time. I brought with me gospel books and tracts, food, clothing, etc. I was not able to hire anyone to carry these things for me and had to carry them myself. I did not feel anything when I walked the first twenty steps. But after that, I began to find them too heavy for me to carry. I thought how nice it would be if I could get home soon and have a little rest. There were no trees on the mountain to provide shade. Just then, I realized how painful are those sinners who are toiling and are burdened. They would probably think that it would be nice if they could rest for a little while. Today among those in the audience, there are still some who have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus. You do not have rest. What will be your end? Come and hear the Lord Jesus' word today, which says, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</P><P>Oh! This world is a tiresome world. Many people have money, yet they say, "I am tired!" Many people are in business, yet they say, "I am tired!" Many people have received fame and love in this world, yet they are tired. They think they can never rest until they have gained a certain item. The world realizes clearly that rest is good, but because their burdens are too heavy, they dare not seek after rest; they would be happy enough if their labor could be reduced. They are like the Israelites in the Old Testament, who only hoped that Pharaoh would reduce their labor and had no hope for rest. The condition of the Israelites represents the world. The Israelites only hoped that their labor could be lightened; they dared not hope for rest. In the same way, you only hope that your burden would be reduced a little, and that you would be free from tiredness and worries. However, I must tell you that what our Lord Jesus gives is not only a reduction of your toil but absolute rest; He causes you to stop everything. I wonder if you know what rest is? Rest means not to work or to stop working. You have suffered from the heavy burden and entanglement of sin and lust and do not have rest. You have to understand that the Lord Jesus wants you to come and have rest. You do not have to do anything to have this rest.</P><P>When I was young, my parents always spoke to me concerning how Jesus became the Savior to appease God's wrath. Then I began to consider how good I would have to behave in order for God not to hate me but to save me to heaven. Many people also think the same way. But here, the Lord says, "You do not have to do anything; just come and have rest." What He wants to give to us is rest. He does not ask us to suffer and to do good. Man enjoys rest. But he always thinks that God is not pleased with him, and that he has to do some good work before God will be pleased with him. But the Lord Jesus calls people to come to rest and not to work. You may think that God hates you, and that you must do good before God will be pleased with you. But the Lord Jesus says that there is no need to work. This is the gospel! Why can the Lord Jesus give rest to people, and why does He not want them to work? The Bible says that the Lord Jesus has already accomplished all the work whether it be the work for going to heaven, the work of redemption, the work related to your being judged before God, the work of justification, or any work related to light, eternal life, and justification. The Lord Jesus has accomplished them all. He only bids you to come to have rest.</P><P>Let me tell you another story. In a certain village there was a Christian who had an unbelieving carpenter as his neighbor. The Christian understood the truth, and he was always trying to persuade the carpenter to believe in Jesus. The carpenter thought that although Jesus had accomplished the work of redemption, it was still not sufficient, and that he still had to do some good work and improve himself before he could believe in Jesus. To him, while it was true that Jesus had redeemed men, men must also do something. For this reason, he did not believe. One night, a thief came to the house of the Christian and tried to enter the main door to steal something. But he heard some noise inside the house and was afraid to go in. As a result, he stole the main door. The next morning when the Christian saw that the main door was taken, he asked his neighbor, the carpenter, to make him another door. The carpenter thought that since this was his neighbor and his good friend, he would select the best wood and hurry to finish the door that same afternoon. When he was ready to put in the door, the Christian said to him, "You have not finished this door; it is still not good enough." He spoke in such a blunt way that the carpenter felt very embarrassed and very upset. The carpenter asked, "I have used the best material and have finished it with extra effort. Why is it still not good?" Nonetheless the Christian insisted that he had not done a good job. Finally the carpenter said, "If this door is not done well, how should it be done to be well?" The Christian said, "Go home and bring me some wood, nails, and a hammer; let me show you how to do it." When the material came, the Christian hammered the boards onto the door haphazardly. The carpenter was both upset and amused. He thought that the Christian's mind must have become muddled up from the break-in and must have become crazy. The Christian then said to him, "Friend, do not be angry. Let us have a talk. Was your door finished?" He said, "Of course, it was finished." The Christian said, "Is it not very good that I added something on?" The carpenter said, "The door was already finished. By adding these boards and nails, you made it no more a door." The Christian said, "The redemptive work of the Lord Jesus is already accomplished. John 19:30 says that it is finished. However, you said that although the Lord Jesus has finished His work, you still have to add something to improve and repair it. This is why I added the nails and the boards to the door which you have already completed." The carpenter understood then and believed in the Lord. The Christian lost a door the night before, but God gained a sinner that day. The Lord Jesus asks us not to work but to come and rest. He has died to bear our sins and has resurrected to secure a new position for us before God. Therefore, we do not have to work. All we have to do is to come to Him and rest. This is the gospel!</P><P>Many people live a life of toil and burden with respect to the world. But many others toil and are burdened with respect to their salvation also. They think that by gritting their teeth to do something and by suffering a little, God may have pity on them and save them. Many Hindus do this. They put nails onto a door with the spikes pointing upward. Then they lie on such doors full of sharp nails, thinking that by suffering this way, the God whom they do not know may by chance have pity on them and forgive their sins. Many people think that if they suffer more, God will forgive their sins. Even a little child would think this way. Once a little child told me, "After I commit a sin, the first thing I have to do is to make myself suffer to the uttermost; then God will forgive my sin." Not only do little children think this way, most people in the world think this way also. They think that by laboring strenuously, they can work themselves to the point where God will forgive them. They do not realize that this is a lie. It is a self-deception and will never earn them anything. It is not by bearing more burdens and suffering more toil that one can have rest before God. The calling today says, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." Redemption has been accomplished, and the Lord has borne our sins. Whosoever will may come to the Lord to have rest. No sinner can obtain rest by himself. If you come before the Lord, you will have rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REST OF VICTORY</H2><P>Now I will speak concerning another rest to those who have believed. "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (Matt. 11:29). Christians ought to have this rest. Sinners ought to have the first rest. A sinner will have no rest until he is accepted by God. A believer has rest because his sins have been forgiven. He can now rest because the question of salvation is solved, and the questions of justification and eternal life are also solved. He is resting in the Lamb; he has obtained the rest in the precious blood. However, a Christian will still at times have no rest. He may feel that there is no rest in worldly affairs and in his living. His heart may run like boiling water. He may have the "rest" of Matthew 11:28, but not the "rest" of verse 29.</P><P>This "rest" in verse 29 is a special "rest." In the original language, the word soul is the same as the psuche in psychology. Therefore, it is talking about the psychological rest. The Bible says the same thing in Psalm 42:5, which says, "Why are you bowed down, O my soul? / And why do you groan within me?" The soul can make one feel cast down and disquieted. The rest that the Lord gives us is the rest for the soul; it saves us from anxieties and disquietness in our living on the earth.</P><P>Following this, the Lord tells us the reason for His having rest in His own soul. Verse 29 says, "I am meek and lowly in heart." The first reason is meekness, and the second reason is lowliness. What is to be "meek"? To be meek is to be gentle, to be without hardness; it is to have nothing irritating and to be absolutely tender, yielding, unresisting, and unobstructing; it is to not protect oneself, to not reject others, and to be soft as water, and to remain so even when one is beaten. This is the life the Lord expressed on earth.</P><P>Many people are very gentle to others, but they are not lowly in heart. Outwardly they may be lowly, but in their heart, they are neither lowly nor yielding. To be "lowly" implies being mean and humble. The Lord was humble in His motive; He considered the kind of treatment He received to be what He deserved. He did not expect anything better; He only expected this kind of treatment. When the Lord was preaching in the big cities, people were opposing Him. Yet He "departed from their midst" in a good way. We may think that this is good enough. But He did more than this; within Him he did not expect any better treatment. He was not only meek but was also lowly. The Lord knew that the kind of life He lived on earth was the portion for Him; He did not expect anything higher. The meaning of the word pride is not merely something outward but something inward. If we want something better than what others have, if we crave something that God has not given us, and if we long for and plan anything for ourselves, it is pride.</P><P>The Lord's attitude on earth was meek and lowly. If we desire to have rest, there are two things that we have to do. First, we have to "take My yoke," and second, we have to "learn from Me." To take the yoke and to learn from Him are two things. A "yoke" is a piece of wood placed on the back of an ox to keep it from going free and to force it to work hard. The Jews always put two oxen to one yoke; they never put one ox to a yoke alone. The yoke is given by the master; the ox does not know how to bear the yoke by itself. This is why the Lord said to us, "Take My yoke." This means that the yoke is apportioned to you by God; it does not come from any person nor from the devil. It is God who has put it on you. However, it is up to us to learn from Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. "Take My Yoke"</H2><P>When I take up whatever God has apportioned to me, I will be happy. If I am satisfied and contented with these things, I will have peace and will not be sad because I have not escaped God's yoke. I have a schoolmate who grew up in an orphanage. He was very intelligent and studied very well. He was a churchgoer but not a Christian. His hope was to have a high education, an outstanding name, and to make a great deal of money. The year of his graduation, a missionary offered to help him to go to the United States to study. He asked him to go first to St. John University in Shanghai to finish his remaining two years of study. The school had prepared a scholarship to take care of him. However, he had been saved a few months before that and heard God's calling to serve Him wholeheartedly. At that time God's yoke was upon him. He thought of how much suffering he would have to bear as a preacher and of the preaching he would have to do among the villages where food, clothing, and lodging would not be comfortable, and he would not have much income. All his hopes fell through! His mother's and uncle's only hope had been on him; such hopes would also fall through! He was reluctant to bear God's yoke and wanted to escape. He promised the principal that he would accept the offer for further education. One day I purposely looked for him and asked him, "Have you settled your future?" He said, "I have already decided to go to the university to study." Because I knew that God had called him, I spoke to him straightforwardly: "You have chosen the wrong path. Do you think you can have rest this way?" He said, "My mother and my uncle have put all their hopes on me. I will study theology as well as literature. I can do some work to gain people on the campus. Will this not satisfy both sides?" I said, "Obedience is better than sacrifice. The Lord is not pleased with the cattle of a thousand hills and the sheep of ten thousand mountains. He is not pleased with oil and burnt offering. He wants man to obey Him." He said, "I have already made my decision." I said, "You have taken the wrong path. If you go to St. John University, you will be poisoned by modern theology, and I am afraid it will overturn even your basic faith. You and I cannot walk on the same path anymore. So long!" After I left, he took a walk around the ballfield and felt very sad; he did not have any peace. Afterwards he went to the school chapel and knelt down to pray. On the one hand, he thought of his deceased father and his widowed mother, and on the other hand, he thought of his future. He could not help but weep. He thought of forsaking God's yoke, yet his heart felt unpeaceful. However he also felt it difficult to obey. Finally, he realized that he had to obey God's will, and he promised before God to give up the opportunity of further study and to preach His word instead. After he obeyed in this way, he rose up from prayer; his heart was very peaceful, and he was full of joy. Immediately he went to see the principal to explain to him the reason for his change and declined the scholarship as well as the tuition assistance from the Westerner for his study abroad. Right away he packed and left the school. He said that night was the happiest night in his whole life. (Please note that my intention is not to discourage you from your study. However if God has called you to preach His word, you should obey. If God has not called you, it is all right even if you study for ten or twenty years.)</P><P>I know that a number of Christians here have this kind of experience. When you bargain with God and want God to give in, while you would not give in, how restless an experience that is. Your conscience is there telling you that you are wrong. How sad you are! However, when you say to God, "I am willing to bear the yoke," you will have rest. Today what God is leading us into is not only to bear God's yoke in the big matters of our life, but also to bear His yoke in the small matters in our daily life. There are some preachers who feel that it is difficult to work with other co-workers. Some sisters feel that it is very difficult to have peace with their aunts and in-laws in their homes. Some feel that it is difficult to be at peace with colleagues; students feel that it is difficult to deal with other students and their teachers. This is your yoke. You may feel that they are bothersome, and that you would much rather leave them alone or that they would leave you alone. You feel irritated, and you have no peace. But, brothers and sisters, this is the yoke God apportions to you. This is what God wants you to bear. This is the portion God assigns to you. God wants you to humble yourself under this kind of environment so that His life can be expressed. You should not ask for any change in your environment; you should know that for God to put you in this environment means that this environment is the best for you.</P><P>What does it mean to bear the cross? It does not mean that you should spend a few thousand dollars to go to the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem to buy a wooden cross and to bear it. Rather, it means that everyone should bear his yoke where he is. This is the portion God has allotted to you. You think that your environment is not good, that it is best to exchange it with somebody. However, this is not bearing the yoke. Sometimes God puts a careful person together with a careless one, a strong one with a weak one, a healthy one with a sick one, a smart one with an ignorant one, a quick one with a slow one, a tidy one with a not-so-tidy one, in order that they might become the yoke of each other, in order that everyone will have the opportunity to manifest the grace they receive from the Lord and express Christ's nature. If you struggle against this arrangement, you will never have rest. If you say to God, "I will bear your yoke; I am willing to be placed in the position you have given me," and if you are willing to obey absolutely, you will have rest and joy.</P><P>The reason Christians cannot bear a good testimony today is that they reject God's yoke. They want to change the environment. Yet the Christian character can only be manifested under that kind of environment. The highest living is one which welcomes everything which one dislikes-things that contradict one's own heart. If you are willing to receive and bear the yoke God gives you, you will be filled with a deep rest within. However, this is not the rest of salvation, which is secured by the redemption of Christ, by what He has accomplished, and by His bearing the cross. This rest is obtained by your own obedience, by your own attitude of denying the self, and by your own bearing of the cross. I hope that after everyone returns home, he will have a new rest. You do not have to brush off your environment as you brush off snow from your clothes on a snowy day. You do not have to strive and struggle in your environment. You only have to say to God, "I thank You, because this is Your yoke." "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." If you do this, you will have joy. Although the environment the Lord Jesus had would justify the worst complaint, He did not complain or murmur and was not anxious to scheme for any change. He only obeyed; therefore, He could rejoice. We should not obey God on the basis of happiness; rather, we have happiness because we obey God. There are countless numbers of people whom you cannot love or work together with. But I hope that from this day on, you will receive God's yoke from His hand, that is, the yoke of meekness and lowliness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. "Learn from Me"</H2><P>Not only do we have to take the yoke, we also have to learn from the Lord. The Lord's pattern is recorded in Philippians 2:6-8: "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross." There are two things we should consider concerning the Lord's pattern.</P><P>The first is that the Lord did not stand up to speak for His own right. "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself." This is to forsake His legal right. Originally, our Lord was equal with God, having the same glory and sharing the same authority. He was the same as God. However, He did not uplift Himself; on the contrary, He emptied Himself and took the form of a slave. Originally, there was nothing wrong with His being equal with God. He was not like the devil, who was a created being, an archangel, yet who tried to lift himself up to become equal with God. The Lord was totally opposite from the devil. He did not strive to become equal with God; rather, He emptied Himself. Therefore, we have to remember that none of us should speak anything for our own rights. Everyone should give up his legal right willingly and joyfully.</P><P>There was a sister who lived like a king at home. After she believed in the Lord, she became like a servant. If she wanted some pocket money from her parents, they would not give it to her so willingly as before. However, she was willing to forsake the position and right she had as their child. Since we belong to Christ, we should not expect our parents to treat us like regular children or our friends to treat us as nice as before. If they do not provide for you, you cannot beg. You ought to place yourselves in the hand of God and learn from Him. "Who, existing in the form of God...emptied Himself." He never spoke anything for Himself; we also should not speak anything for ourselves.</P><P>The rest in our Christian life lies not only in not taking advantage of others, but in being able to endure when others take advantage of us. Many young Christians took advantage of others before they believed in the Lord. After they believe in the Lord, they begin to treat others justly. Now when they see others being unjust, they become indignant. Little do they realize that the Christian standard does not stop merely at being just but at enduring the unjust. What the Lord received was not justice. If it had been according to justice, the Lord would have had no need to come to be a man and would not have needed to save man. But for our sake, He was willing to endure all kinds of unjust treatment.</P><P>The second matter is His "taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." This is to say that He became limited. Originally when our Lord was in the heavens, He could come and go freely like the angels; He could also appear to man like the angels did in the Old Testament. However, He descended to the earth and was made in the likeness of men to become an infant and then an adult. He grew up year after year in the human way; like all other men, He also needed to eat, drink, sleep, work, and rest. This is the limitation on His divinity that He received. However, He was not only made in the likeness of men, but also took the form of a slave. Although He had given up His freedom as God, He could still have His freedom as a man, and He could still enjoy whatever the other men could enjoy. Yet He took the form of a slave and sacrificed even the freedom He had as an ordinary man. In every aspect He endured the entanglement and limitations which are unbearable to man. Besides God's-the Father's-will, He did not know anything else. This was the restriction on His humanity. Although He was God, He was limited. Although He was a man, He was limited. How about us? Our hearts would rather rebel. How we wish to break off all the entanglements and restrictions so that we can move freely. How we wish everything and everyone in the world would go along with our desires and according to our hearts' delight. We are not like the Lord; although He was God, He still was restricted. Among us, many mothers would wish not to be mothers but would prefer to go out to preach the word freely instead. There was a wife who once told me that if her husband would allow her, she would leave her three children behind and go to Tibet to preach the gospel. She thought that it would be wonderful if she could break all the entanglements and fly away. However, this is not the Lord's pattern. The Lord was God, but He still obeyed His parents and took care of His younger brothers and sisters. We ought to obey and not be ambitious. Since God has used your children to limit you and your family to restrict you, you should submit willingly and joyously. It is wrong for a businessman to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to be in business," or a student to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to study." It would be wrong for a worker to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to work," and for a teacher to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to teach." If we would be like our Lord who accepts all kinds of restriction without any struggling, we would have rest.</P><P>Therefore, an unbeliever can have rest, the rest of being reconciled to God. At the same time, if a worrisome, restless, and troubled Christian is willing to bear the yoke of meekness and lowliness, learn from the Lord's limitation, and not stand up to speak for his own rights day after day, but is willing to accept the yoke which God has apportioned to him day after day and choose for himself a life of restriction, he will surely have rest in his heart.</P><P>The Lord said, "For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." Every person who is experienced in the Lord will say "amen" to this. How rough are the roads we have chosen for ourselves! How troublesome are the things which we do according to our own desire! How pitiful are the consequences and how many difficulties there are along the way! If we are willing to take up the Lord's yoke and learn from Him, we will see that the things He gives us, the demand he has upon us, and the environment which He has arranged for us are all easy and light. Nothing that He causes us to pass through is unbearable for us. He knows how to apportion His yoke; He knows our strength. We can be at rest. He will not require of us what we cannot do. Whatever He apportions is what each brother and sister can bear. As one would not put an iron yoke on a three-month-old calf, the Lord will not ask a person to encounter something in his environment that he cannot endure. Before something comes upon us, God has already decided that we are able and have the strength to pass through such a thing. God does not make a mistake. Therefore, we should not murmur. Instead, we should quietly, humbly, gently, and joyfully accept all the yokes and burdens He gives us, even though many of these are not according to our desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CORRESPONDENCE</H2><P>Our sister, Miss Ruth Lee, because of her health, is now in Sha Ming Tung On receiving the rest she needs.

Brother Watchman Nee went to Japan at the end of March to work for a week. On April 11, we had Mr. Ming Cheng Lan, Miss Wei Ching Siou, and Miss Moo Jeir Chirk baptized to enter into Christ. We thank the Lord for all these works!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE POWER OF CHOOSING</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 7:1-2, 10-15</H1><P>We are here today for one thing only, which is to learn more concerning the Lord Jesus. All of us know how perfect the Lord was when He was on this earth. In reading the four Gospels, we can see how good and perfect the outward living of the Lord was. Yet from the four Gospels, we cannot tell why the Lord had such a superb outward living. Why was He so perfect, and why was He such a Son of Man? Isaiah 7:15 gives us the reason He had such a living. Why was He able to refuse the evil and choose the good? How did He know to reject the world and choose God's will? How did He know to reject glory from men and choose glory from God? We can find out the answer to these questions from Isaiah 7. Verse 14 says, "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel." We know that this refers to the Lord Jesus. Unfortunately, many people have dropped verse 15. We should know that not only does verse 14 refer to the Lord, but that verse 15 also refers to Him. Verse 15 tells us that He ate butter and honey all his life. Because He ate butter and honey all His life, He was able to choose the good things and refuse the bad things. This is why He could obey God, seek for His glory, and win His heart.</P><P>What is the significance of butter and honey? Among all the tasteful foods, butter is the richest of them all. Moreover, nothing in the world is sweeter than honey. Butter is the richest food, while honey is the sweetest food. The Lord Jesus ate the richest and sweetest food throughout His life. This is why He could reject the evil and choose the good.</P><P>The Bible tells us what the richest thing is. It is God's grace. The Bible also tells us what the sweetest thing is. It is God's love. All the time, God placed before Christ the rich grace and gave Him to taste the sweet love. This is why He could obey God and choose His will. This is why He could reject the evil and choose the good. Today we will consider a little how the Lord ate butter and honey, and how He rejected the evil and chose the good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LORD'S YOUTH<br>(LUKE 2:41-51)</H2><P>At the age of twelve, our Lord went with His parents to Jerusalem to keep the feast. After the feast His parents returned, but He remained in Jerusalem without their knowing about it. Later His parents returned to Jerusalem to look for Him. After three days they found Him in the temple. His mother said, "Child, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I, being greatly distressed, have been seeking You." The Lord did not answer saying, "Do you not know that I should do My Father's will?" Instead, He answered, saying, "Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?" The Lord had eaten the butter and the honey. At the age of twelve, the Lord knew the Father already. He had the heavenly butter and honey. He had received the richest and the sweetest and was living in God's will. If it were us, we might have said, "Go back to Nazareth to care for your carpentry and your housework. I will not go. Let me stay in the temple." Our Lord did not behave this way. He spoke, and He testified; yet He went back with them. After they returned to Nazareth, He was subject to them. The reason He could choose the difficult thing was that God had given Him the richest and sweetest taste.</P><P>Mary was a very good woman. At the same time she was a very small woman. The better a person is in the world, the smaller his head is. Often, the best persons have the smallest heads; they are the most muddled ones. In reading the four Gospels, we see that Mary bothered the Lord all the time. When the wine ran out, she told Him, "They have no wine" (John 2:3). While He was preaching to many people, she would come to speak with Him (Matt. 12:46). Yet the Bible says that "He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them." This was the Lord's choice. It was something that others would find hard to do. He could have rejected them and stayed in the temple. But He chose to return with them and to live with a simple-minded and ignorant Mary. The reason for this is that He had eaten butter and honey and was able to choose what was otherwise unbearable to men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING BAPTIZED BY JOHN THE BAPTIST<br>(MATTHEW 3:13-17)</H2><P>When John saw Jesus coming to him, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). Later he said, "He who is coming after me is stronger than I." How much stronger? He said, "Whose sandals I am not worthy to carry." The Lord Jesus was so great! Yet He came to be baptized by John. If we had come and were so great, with such seniority, being preeminent from eternity and being King of the heavenly kingdom, we would have shown ourselves off. Although we may not say anything with our mouth, subconsciously we would show ourselves off as being better than others. We are born proud, and we love to show that we are greater than everyone else in front of everyone. Yet the Lord came to the Jordan and was baptized by John.</P><P>Is it an easy thing to be baptized by others? There was an old sister in Foochow who was a very nice person. She realized that she needed to be baptized, but she wanted to choose the person who would baptize her. Some brothers were well-respected in her eyes, while others were not well- respected in her eyes. She had made up her mind not to be baptized by a certain brother and designated another person to baptize her. All those who are a little better off than others in this world try to select some well-respected ones to baptize them.</P><P>Our Lord was very peculiar. He was extremely extraordinary. Even John the Baptist marveled and tried to stop Him, saying, "It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?" What did the Lord say? He said, "Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness." He was willing to go to the Jordan, to the death water. He chose humiliation and death. He fulfilled all righteousness. Righteousness was actually fulfilled on the cross, but it was first expressed in the death water. He chose the good and rejected the evil.</P><P>Consider how much trouble there was for the Lord to be baptized by John the Baptist. The Lord would lose all His "loftiness" before the world, the sinners, the tax collectors, and the prostitutes, for they were all baptized by John as well. When the Lord began to preach, He said the same thing that John did: "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent" (Mark 1:15). The audience was the same group of people as those who had heard John. A tax collector among them might say, "Was He not baptized together with us on that day? Why, He is teaching us today!" Another sinner might repeat, "Was He not baptized together with us on that day? And now He is teaching us today!" This would surely have been embarrassing and unsightly. Later, trouble did occur. When the Lord and His disciples went to live in Judea and baptized men there, some came to John saying, "He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him" (John 3:26). They despised Him. The Lord had put Himself in a most difficult position. Yet He chose this. The reason is that behind Him there was power; He had tasted of the rich grace and the sweet love. He had eaten the butter and the honey. He had tasted the richest and sweetest. This is why He was able to humble Himself to the lowest.</P><P>If we can ever humble ourselves, and if we are ever willing to humble ourselves, it is because we have the butter, the richest grace, and the honey, the sweetest love. This is why we can humble ourselves before men. This is why we are willing to humble ourselves. The world cannot do this, but we can because we have the richest grace and the sweetest love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. DURING THE TEMPTATION<br>(MATTHEW 4:1-10)</H2><P>When the Lord came out of the water after His baptism, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove. Later He was led by the Spirit to the wilderness to be tempted by the devil for forty days and nights. In the end, Satan himself appeared to Him and tempted Him saying, "If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread" (Matt. 4:3). When the stomach is hungry, it is not a sin to eat. But the Lord rejected the offer. The main goal of Satan's temptation was for the Lord to do one thing according to His own will. He wanted the Lord to resort to His own way to satisfy His hunger. But the Lord said, "It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" (v. 4). He was willing to suffer hunger, and He was able to suffer hunger. I am presenting one thing before all of you today: if we want to live like the Lord, we must daily receive in a hidden way the butter and honey from heaven. The Lord was able to turn the stones into loaves. But He did not do it because He already had the butter and honey.</P><P>Perhaps a little joy, a little glory, or a little comfort is already lying at your fingertips. Once you say something, you will have it. Or you may not need to say anything at all and you will have it. It may be within your power of reach, and you may be able to get it without exerting any effort of your own. What will you do? The Lord would not turn the stones into loaves. But we would much rather do it. We would not only turn the stones into loaves, we would wish we could turn all the stones into loaves. We wish we could do our best to serve ourselves. The reason we do this is that we have not tasted of the heavenly butter and honey. If we have the butter and honey, we would be willing to give up everything that is ours and everything that lies at our fingertips. There is only one kind of person in this world who will consecrate himself to God; it is one who knows His love. There is only one kind of person in this world who is qualified to sacrifice his own joy; it is one who knows God's grace.</P><P>The Lord was not tempted in only one thing. Satan said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down." How marvelous it would be to fly down from heaven. Will not men recognize such as the Messiah? He could have received His glory with simpler ways. But He would not do this. Satan told the Lord, "All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me." Is it not good to receive all the kingdoms of the world and their glory when all one has to do is to secretly worship him a little? The kingdoms of the world are good. But our Lord was able to give them up and decline them because behind Him there was a power. He knew God as no one else did. He was filled with the Holy Spirit as no one was. He tasted of the riches of grace and the sweetness of love as no one else did. This is why He could do it. This is why He was able to give these things up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE LORD REBUKING PETER<br>(MATTHEW 16:21-23)</H2><P>Peter had heard two to three times from the Lord that He must go up to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes and be killed. And on the third day He would be raised. Peter felt bad about this; he pitied the Lord and said to Him, "God be merciful to You." We may think that the Lord would have comforted Peter a little and would have told Peter, "It is good that you love Me. But I have to go to Jerusalem. I have to die." Instead, the Lord said, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men." Here the Lord made a clear choice-He chose death.</P><P>If there is anyone in this world who has ever chosen the cross and the narrow way, this person must have first tasted the riches of God's grace and the sweetness of His love. Recently, News Magazine published the martyrdom of Miss Han and Miss Nien, two Western lady missionaries in Fukien. These two British women were working in Fukien and were kidnapped by bandits. First Miss Nien's fingers were cut off by the bandits. A month ago both were killed. How could they suffer this? Both of them were old and were deep in the Lord. Before she died, Miss Han wrote a poem called "The Martyrs," in which one of the lines says, "The faces of the martyrs are the faces of angels! The hearts of the martyrs are the hearts of lions." The faces of the angels are beautiful, and the hearts of the lions are bold. How amazing it is that a martyr could write such a song of martyrdom! Before she died, she wrote to one of her friends, "God's grace is sufficient for me. The circumstance tells us that we are in danger and in difficulties. But I have never in my life been as close to God as I am now."</P><P>There was one missionary of the China Inland Mission who was kidnapped. Later he was released and some friends asked him of his experience. He said that since his regeneration, he had never experienced a day when he was as full of peace and joy as the night he heard the bullets ringing around him and the ways of escape were cut off from him.</P><P>There must be a reason and power behind the actions of martyrs. Do not think that God gives weak ones like us a poor wage and asks us to bear great burdens. Our God has given us butter and honey. By these we can sacrifice and suffer martyrdom. This is not a pretense; it is not a matter of words only. I know this as a fact, and many people know this also. The reason anyone can give something up, deny himself, or choose the difficult things is that, behind him, there is a great power. The reason the Lord Jesus was able to reject the evil and choose the good was that there was a power behind Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. DURING THE TRANSFIGURATION<br>(LUKE 9:28-31)</H2><P>On the mount of transfiguration, the Lord manifested to God and men the highest expression of Himself as a man. The Bible never says that we will be perfect in this life. The Bible only says that God will keep us in a blameless state in this life. It never says that we will be without mistake or without blemish. But our Lord was without blemish in this life. I have spoken once about the Lord on the mount of transfiguration. Many expositors agree that the Lord could have ascended to heaven from there; God would have to receive Him if He had. Mark 4:28-29 says, "The earth bears fruit by itself: first a blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear. But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come." The Lord was ripe already, and God had to receive Him. While He was talking to Moses and Elijah, the conversation was concerning the matter of His death, that is, what was about to take place in Jerusalem. After He descended from the mount, His heart was set towards Jerusalem. His face was towards Jerusalem. He chose death. Here we see the Lord making another choice. The reason our Lord was able to choose not to ascend to heaven from the mount of transfiguration and choose the pathway to Jerusalem was that He had tasted of the heavenly butter and honey. The reason the Lord could decline ascending to the Father from the mount and the reason He could descend instead to the cross was that He had tasted of God's grace and His love. Without God's grace and His love, He could not have suffered this way. Some children suffer for their parents, but they do so unwillingly. Some parents suffer for their children, but they do so with murmuring. Some students submit to their teachers, but it is not a voluntary action. Only Christ, who had eaten the butter and the honey and tasted the richest and the sweetest, was able to choose the difficult things, that is, the good things, willingly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. ENTERING JERUSALEM<br>(JOHN 12:12-28)</H2><P>Two events were most glorious in the Lord's life: the mount of transfiguration and the entrance into Jerusalem. When He entered Jerusalem, many people welcomed Him with palm branches, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!" This was what the Jews said. Moreover, He had many friends. Lazarus had just resurrected, and some were preparing a feast for Him. A few Gentile Greeks came to Philip and asked to see Him. They all wanted to see Jesus. Even the Lord's enemies, the Pharisees, said among themselves, "You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him" (John 12:19). At this time, the Lord could have gained anything He wanted. But when Andrew went with Philip to see the Lord, what did He say? He said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). Here was another choice. He could have received His glory and become king at that time. But He only chose one way. What He said here deeply touches my heart. "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</P><P>"Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say?" (v. 27). This word shows that the Lord's heart agreed with His mouth. "Father, save Me out of this hour. But for this reason I have come to this hour." The Lord could have asked the Father to save Him out of that hour, but He knew that for this reason He had come to that hour. The Lord was again rejecting the evil and choosing the good. Formerly, when we read this portion, we did not know how He could have made such a choice. But the Bible tells us that it is because He had tasted butter and honey. He had tasted the riches of grace and the sweetness of love. This is why He could choose the good and reject the evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. IN GETHSEMANE<br>(MATTHEW 26:36-46)</H2><P>Finally, in the garden of Gethsemane, the Lord made the greatest choice! There He could have said, "I will not die." He did say, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me" (v. 39). But immediately following, He said, "Yet not as I will, but as You will." Although He saw the bitterness of the cup, He dared not choose His own will. He was not afraid to die, but He was fearful of the burden of sin. He was not afraid of the cup, but His holy nature was fearful of bearing sin. Before He put the cup and God's will together, He was still able to say, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me." But immediately following, He said, "Yet not as I will, but as You will." Hence, in the garden of Gethsemane, we see that He single-heartedly chose God's will and single-heartedly rejected everything that was not God's will. Finally, what did He say to Peter? He said, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). I can tell you that without Gethsemane, there would have been no cross. Without the obedience of Gethsemane, there would not have been the death on the cross. Obedience came before the cross. Our Lord humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and died the death of a cross (Phil. 2:8). Many people have not taken care of the consecration at Gethsemane properly. This is why they run away when they face the cross. They do not have the power behind them. Our Lord had the butter and the honey. This is why He was able to choose the good and reject the evil.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, obedience requires power! If God has not first satisfied your heart, you will never succeed no matter how hard you outwardly try. We have to learn to contact God daily and receive the heavenly butter and honey, so that we can choose the good and reject the evil on earth. I say this to you because I have a deep feeling that the Lord is coming soon, and the kingdom is before us. From now on, temptations will increase, dangers will increase, and seductions will increase. Formerly we rejected the sins. Now we have to reject the joys. Formerly we suffered God's stripping. Now we have to willingly obey. Formerly we bore the yoke grudgingly. Now we choose the cross willingly. More and more we are seeing that, unless we know to choose the good and reject the evil, all kinds of things will come upon us. Satan will grant us more favor. The world will become kinder to us and give us many things. The circumstances will turn more to our way, and unless we reject them in a definite way, we will not be able to overcome them. How can we overcome the world? If the Lord had not chosen death Himself, it would be possible for us to not die and love our life. But let us pay attention to one thing: we have the ability to choose what is placed before us because we have the heavenly butter and honey. We have to receive daily the butter and honey from heaven, so that we will know what to choose and what to reject. We should not allow our circumstances to make the choices for us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A SILENT TESTIMONY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 12:1-3, 9-11</H1><P>In this passage we see Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. What was Martha doing? She was serving the Lord. Mary was doing the same thing she had been doing all the time, consecrating herself. What about Lazarus? We think that he should have been doing something. Martha was loved by the Lord, Mary was loved by the Lord, and Lazarus was also loved by the Lord. At that time Martha served the Lord, Mary consecrated herself to the Lord, and Lazarus just sat there. What did he accomplish by sitting there? Some Jews believed in the Lord because of Lazarus. He did not do anything. He did not consecrate. By merely sitting there, God received the glory.</P><P>When a sinner is saved, all he has to do is sit and Christ will get the glory. Sitting is worshipping. Many times we cannot do much; we have nothing to offer to the Lord. All we can do is sit. Perhaps we cannot be involved specifically with services like Martha was. Perhaps we cannot buy ointment to consecrate to the Lord like Mary did. But if we were dead and stinking, merely by sitting here today, we would be the expression of the Lord's power, the proof of the Lord's love, and the manifestation of the Lord's grace. We may have been dead, stinking, cold, and far away from the Lord; but today we are sitting here. We are not doing anything; we are not consecrating anything. We are not even saying anything. We are just sitting here. While we are sitting here, we are reminders that the Lord has resurrected us. By this alone, God gains the glory.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SAVED?</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:19-22</H1><P>In the Scriptures that we have just read, the portion after the phrase "let us" tells us what we should do, while the portion before it tells us what the Lord has accomplished. Since we have obtained so much, we need to draw nigh unto God with a true heart and in full assurance of faith.</P><P>Here is something that deserves our special attention. There is a great difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament. In the New Testament one starts from a position to which he has already attained and proceeds step by step onward, whereas in the Old Testament one starts by advancing step by step until he attains to a certain position. In other words, in the Old Testament men did not have any position at all. It was like students taking an entrance examination for a school; there was no assurance that they had been accepted. Those in the Old Testament had no assurance before God at all; everyone was under the test. This is why they had to try their best to worship God and please Him, hoping that one day they would receive a position before God and have eternal life.</P><P>The reverse is true in the New Testament. Blessed is the man who knows that the New Testament is the reverse of the Old Testament! The New Testament is entirely different from the Old Testament. The Old Testament requires that man try his best to draw near to God and win a position. The New Testament begins by giving men a position. Furthermore, that position never changes. Every New Testament believer has received his position in Christ; he has received eternal life. After this he draws nigh to God. In the Old Testament one has to try his best to draw nigh to God before he can secure a position for himself. In the New Testament a position has been secured, and one comes to God with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, today I wish to point out one thing. We should stand in the position that God has given us. A while ago many people were saved. Please remember that the first work a newly saved person has to do is to clearly recognize the position in which he is standing. I can tell you today that God's Word has made it plain that everyone who is in the Lord has obtained a position. This means that he is a child of God and can draw nigh to the Lord. All the work we have at present is based on the fact that we have obtained a position. We do not work hard before we become saved. All those who have this kind of concept do not know God and do not know His Word.</P><P>I would like to tell you a few stories. Once I was preaching the gospel at one place for about six to seven days. I asked the audience at the end, "Do you believe in Jesus?" Many people answered boldly, "Yes, I do." I asked further, "If you have believed, what have you received?" Many of them could not answer. Later on I said, "Whosoever knows that he is saved, please raise up his hand." There were about six hundred people in the congregation. But only three hands were raised. The three persons were not actually from that locality. They were saved through my preaching elsewhere, and I had brought them there with me. There were six hundred people who believed in the Lord, but there were not even three who were saved. This was indeed strange.</P><P>In 1924 I preached in Changchow for more than ten days and asked the same question. I asked if they had believed in Jesus as their Savior. More than a thousand hands were raised. But when I asked again, "Now that you have believed, do you know that you have eternal life, that you will not perish, and that once you believe, you are saved forever?" It was most amazing! Just a minute before, a thousand hands were raised. But now not a single hand was raised from the audience. Only my translator on the platform raised his hand. I told them, "The Lord says that he who believes has eternal life. You have believed. Why do you not know that you have eternal life?"</P><P>Another time, at a meeting with more than a thousand people, I asked if they believed in the Lord. Over a thousand hands were raised simultaneously. When I asked again if they were saved, there were only twelve to thirteen hands. Why was there such a big difference in the number of hands? There were over a thousand believers, but only slightly more than ten thought they were saved. Does this mean that Christ is not dependable? Suppose a doctor posted a sign saying, "All patients will be cured." If you ask him, "How many patients do you have?" he may say, "Over a thousand." If you ask him again, "How many have been cured?" and he says, "Eleven or twelve out of a thousand were cured," you will surely say that this doctor is not dependable. Many consulted him, but few were cured. If more than a thousand believed in the Lord Jesus but only eleven to twelve are saved, this means that He is not dependable.</P><P>Another time I was holding meetings in a certain county around Swatow. I found that even many elders, pastors, deacons, and those who were supposed to be teaching others were themselves ignorant of this fact. They preached salvation to others, yet they themselves did not understand or know their own position. They did not know that once a person believes, he has eternal life and will not perish. They did not have any assurance about this matter.</P><P>Not only in public but also during private conversations, I have met many such people. Once when a woman discussed this matter with me, I asked if she believed. She was not an eloquent person and did not have much knowledge. She told me that her grandparents and her parents were all believers and that she herself was also a believer. Having said that, she recited to me the Ten Commandments, just to show me that she knew something about religion. Then I told her, "We believers have nothing that we cannot say. May I ask you a question? If you were to die now, could you say that you are saved?" She answered, "I dare not say this. I am trying my best to behave well, help others, and serve the Lord. When that day comes, if the Lord is merciful to me and lets me go to heaven, it will be wonderful. If He is not merciful to save me, I will not be saved." I began to explain many things to her. After some time she began to understand. Had I not explained all this to her, she would still be saying, "I will try my best to behave, sacrifice, and suffer, hoping that one day I will be saved."</P><P>Once I was talking to a young, knowledgeable seminary student. He was not clear concerning the matter of salvation. He said, "I am trying my best to work and do good. In the future if God says that I am worthy to go to heaven, I will be saved. Saying that I am saved while I am on the earth today is too boastful and proud." I had to spend much time with him before he was brought to an understanding of his position in salvation.</P><P>In my public and private meetings with people, I have met many believers who dare not say that they are saved. They refuse to believe that the Bible is the Word of God. Whatever God says, it is so. Whatever God says will not change; it will definitely come to pass. Many people think, "I should try my best to work and to do good, hoping that God will save me in the future." However, hoping is not believing. Please remember that every time the Bible mentions faith, it is in reference to accomplished facts in the past and not to things in the future. All those who hope to be saved have a problem with their faith concerning the Lord's accomplished salvation. They hope to receive God's promise and grace, but they will not believe in Him. God is not pleased with such an attitude.</P><P>Now we want to examine another matter. Can a believer know that he has eternal life? Can he know that he is already saved? Concerning this matter, I would not say anything and would not ask you to say anything. Let this book-the Bible-speak to us. Let us now read a few portions of the Scriptures to see if we can know that we have eternal life.</P><P>First, please read 1 John 5:13: "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God." We have to grasp the last sentence of this verse. Does it tell you to hope? Not at all. It says that we should know that we have eternal life. To whom does John write the letter? To those who believe into the name of the Son of God. Who is the Son of God? He is Christ. What did John say when he wrote to those who believe in Jesus Christ? He wrote so that they may know that they have eternal life. Does a believer have eternal life? The Bible says that we can know this. John's purpose in writing is to let those who believe into the name of the Son of God know that they have eternal life.</P><P>Next let us look at Acts 13:38-39: "Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." What does the first sentence say? Does it say, "Brothers, be hopeful"? or "Brothers, you should believe"? Not at all. It does not say to hope or to believe; rather, it says, "Let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." Can we know that we are justified and forgiven? Paul's word says that we can. He says that we should know that we are justified and forgiven. Those who believe should know this and should not need others to tell them this.</P><P>Let us see 2 Corinthians 5:1: "For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens." Unlike the last verse in Acts, which says that we should know, this verse is a command. It says clearly that we know. It seems to be telling us that no one needs to explain, there is no need to struggle to understand, and the matter should be very apparent. What is it that we should know? Paul says, "For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling (our physical body) is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling (our resurrected body) not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens." Paul knew assuredly that if our earthly bodies die, we will have resurrected and eternal bodies in the heavens. In other words, Paul knew that we are saved. The words here are stated most clearly; there is no ambiguity at all. Paul was very careful in saying these words. Otherwise, others may misunderstand, saying, "Since Paul is an apostle and has worked so well, surely he will go to heaven when he dies. But I am not that fervent, and I do not love the Lord that much. If I die, I may not have a resurrected body." Paul was very careful in saying what he said. He did not say, "I know if my earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down." Paul used we. This includes not just you and me, but all those who believe in the Lord. If our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. This shows us once more that whoever believes may know that he has eternal life and is saved.</P><P>Following this, verses 6 and 8 say, "Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the Lord...we are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord." Paul had no doubt concerning where he would go after he departed from his body; He was certain that he would not go to the eternal dreadful place. He knew that he would be with the Lord forever. Therefore, he was confident and was not afraid of death at all. This shows us again that we do not have to wait for the future; we can know today whether we are saved.</P><P>Read again 2 Timothy 1:12: "For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day." Why did Paul say, "I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day?" What did Paul commit to the Lord when he believed in Him? He committed his future eternal salvation to the Lord. Paul was persuaded that the Lord was able to keep that which he had committed unto Him unto that day. He knew very clearly and understood very well that all the matters that he had committed to the Lord would be kept and not be lost unto that day.</P><P>The few passages that we have read testify that we can know that we have eternal life and that we can know that we are saved while we are still on earth. Anyone should know today if he is saved. Friends, please do not take the excuse that we do not know whether we will go to heaven or to hell until we are judged before God in the future. Let me repeat: we can know today whether we are saved and whether we will go to heaven.</P><P>Now let me mention a few things. How do we know that we have eternal life and are saved? First, we have to know how one can have eternal life. If we know the way of justification and the forgiveness of sins, we will know whether or not we have passed that way. If we have passed that way, we have eternal life; if not, we do not have eternal life. Let me now tell you the way to obtain eternal life. Many people know this way, and many have heard this from others. But I still want to repeat it.</P><P>The New Testament mentions at least one hundred fifty times that those who believe will have eternal life; they will have life and not be condemned but will be saved. What does John 3:16, a verse most familiar to us, tell us? It tells us that God loves the world. How does He love? To what extent has He loved? He loved to the extent that He gave His only begotten Son. God has given His only begotten Son to the world, and Jesus has died for sinners and accomplished the work of redemption. What happens after this? It goes on to say that whoever believes in Him would not perish but have eternal life. This verse has three main points. It mentions a great fact, a great condition, and a great result. The great fact is that God has sent Jesus to the world to redeem men and to be their Savior. The great condition is the one thing that everyone should do-believe. The great result is too good; it is something man has never thought of: whoever believes will not perish, but have eternal life. The great fact is that God so loved the world. To what extent did He love? He loved to the extent that He gave His only begotten Son to the world to die on the cross for men's sins and save all the sinners. This is the great fact. Nothing is greater and truer than this. Now there is a great condition, a great demand placed before every man. Man has to fulfill this condition. What is this condition? Everyone should believe that God has accomplished such a fact and should believe in God's accomplishment. This is the unique condition and something that everyone should fulfill. The great fact is accomplished by God, and the great condition is to be fulfilled by man. What then is the great result? It is that we would not perish but have eternal life. This is to be saved. Since the Lord has said that those who believe in Him would not perish but have eternal life, do you think that after we have believed, that we will still perish? Even if the Lord could be unrighteous, He could not be unrighteous to such an extent. Of course, our God is a righteous God! Whoever believes will surely have eternal life and will not perish. God will accomplish this according to what He says.</P><P>Once there was a medical doctor who was a very good believer in the Lord. He took care of his patients well, and whenever there was the opportunity, he would preach the gospel to them. Once he was treating a widow's sickness. In the course of their conversation, he asked if she was a believer. She answered, "Yes, I truly believe in Jesus and have accepted Him as my Savior." The doctor asked again, "If you have truly believed and accepted Jesus as your Savior, do you have eternal life? Suppose this sickness does not get cured and you die, will you go to heaven or to hell?" She said, "Sir, I dare not say. I have been a Christian for many years, and I try my best to do good works. If God sees me fit to be saved and go to heaven, it will be wonderful; otherwise, there is nothing that I can do." The doctor said, "Wait. Let me ask you a question. Since you have been a Christian for so many years, surely you have memorized some verses by heart." She said, "Of course, there are many Scripture verses I can recite. The most familiar one is John 3:16. Even when I was in kindergarten, my teacher had me memorize it. I have known this verse by heart for the last fifty to sixty years." Then she recited: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life." The doctor said, " Very good, but now do you have eternal life?" She answered, "Sir, I just told you that I try my best to do good, hoping that in the future God will approve me and give me eternal life. Then I will know if I have eternal life. Only good Christians like you, doctor, have the boldness to say that you have eternal life. I would not dare to say it." The doctor said gently, "Madam, you have memorized John 3:16 incorrectly." She said, "This cannot be. I have had this verse memorized for fifty to sixty years. How can I be wrong?" The doctor said, "Please recite it again," and she recited it in the same way again. When she finished, she asked to the doctor, "What did I say wrong?" The doctor immediately asked her, "Do you have eternal life?" She replied anxiously, "I have told you two to three times that I dare not say that I have it; I only endeavor to do good, hoping that on that day God will say that I have eternal life. While I am on the earth today, I dare not say that I have it." The doctor said gently again, "You have still recited John 3:16 incorrectly." She said, "I have just recited it to you without any error. Yet you say again that I am wrong. Please do not make fun of me. How can I be wrong after having known it for fifty to sixty years? It is you who have memorized it wrong." Then she stood up to look for a Bible and placed John 3:16 in front of the doctor, saying, "I will recite it again. Please look at it word by word to see if I am wrong." After she had recited it, she said, "Sir, who is wrong? Was I not correct?" The doctor said, "Please calm down. I just want to ask if you have eternal life." She answered in a furious way, "You said that I recited John 3:16 incorrectly; why do you ask me about this matter again? Have I not told you three to four times that I dare not say whether I have eternal life, and that I only hope God will say I have it in the future." The doctor said again, "You have recited John 3:16 incorrectly." She answered, "I give up. Would you please recite it for me." The doctor said, "Fine," and he went on to recite John 3:16. Then the woman said, "How is yours different from mine? Check and see that what you have recited was exactly what I recited." He said, "They are not the same; now let me recite your John 3:16 for you: `For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him and endeavors to do good, and after whose death God will judge and say that he may have eternal life, because God has delighted in him, such a one will have eternal life and will not perish.' My John 3:16 says, `That every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.'" The woman then understood what the doctor meant. She had thought that John 3:16 had two parts with the first part ending after "believes into Him," after which one could insert any word before proceeding to the second part "would not perish, but would have eternal life." Now she knew that John 3:16 is only one sentence. Everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</P><P>O brothers and sisters, please remember that every one who believes has eternal life. God cannot lie. What God has said must be. Whenever you believe, you have eternal life. Many years ago there was an evangelist, Mr. Chapman, who saved many souls during his preaching and was very well known. He is now with the Lord. I mention him because the story of his salvation has something to do with what we are speaking today. He was a doctor of philosophy, a highly educated man. Once he heard Mr. Moody's preaching. Mr. Moody was an uneducated laborer. When the two conversed with each other, Mr. Moody asked him, "Are you a Christian?" Mr Chapman answered, "Sometimes I am good and sometimes not. When I am zealous I am the most zealous of all men; but when I am cold there is no one colder than I. When I am zealous, I can boldly say that I am a Christian, but when I am cold, I dare not claim that I am a Christian." Mr. Moody did not say anything but asked him to read John 5:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." After reading the verse, he asked Mr. Chapman, "Are you a saved Christian?" Although Mr. Chapman had a doctorate degree, he responded the same way as that old widow: "I have told you that when I endeavor to do good, I am a Christian, but when I am cold and am not doing good, I am not a Christian." Moody said, "What does this verse say? What do you have after you have heard the gospel and believed in the One that sent Christ, that is, after you have believed in the heavenly Father? Does not the Bible say that this kind of person has eternal life and has passed out of death into life? Mr. Chapman, since you are a believer in the Lord, you are a saved Christian." Mr. Chapman stopped and considered doubtfully. Then he said, "I still cannot say that I am a Christian. How terrible a person I am! Many times I am indeed zealous, but many times I am cold." Moody took the Bible in his hand and said, "Dr. Chapman, whose word is it that you are doubting?" Right then, Mr Chapman realized that he was doubting God's word. Later, he testified in his sermon that from that time on, he knew he had eternal life.</P><P>For one who believes in the Lord to say that he does not have eternal life is not humility, but unbelief. It is to doubt God's words and God's righteous and unchanging character. Everyone who is in the Lord has eternal life and is not condemned but has passed out of death into life. The day when we believe, we are regenerated and have a new life. This is the gospel! I present this matter before everyone, to let you know that you have eternal life.</P><P>Read again John 6:47: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life." If the whole Bible were taken away and only this verse remained, it would still be sufficient to solve the matter concerning salvation. Believing is not hoping; it is not waiting for the future, or doing anything. The Bible says, "He who believes has eternal life." God's Word will not change.</P><P>Let me tell you another very simple story. Some years ago there was a very well-known servant of the Lord who was also a medical doctor. He did profound research in the medical field. In addition, he had a strong faith. At his work, he always exhorted people to believe in the Lord. One time he went to a hospital and saw lying in bed a sick young lady, whose life was almost over. He was an aged person, and he went over and asked her, "Are you happy?" She said, "No, I do not have any joy at all." He asked, "Why are you not happy? Have you believed in Jesus?" She said, "Yes, I have truly believed in Jesus as my Savior, and I have committed all my sins to Him." He then asked, "Do you have eternal life? Are you saved?" She said, "This is the very question I cannot resolve. The doctor said that my temperature is very high and that I do not have long to live. I still do not know how God will treat me when I see Him. I am very sad and am not happy at all. If a man has done good all his life, made sacrifices, endeavored to work and save people, and deserved some special merits, he may have eternal life. But I do not have many days on earth, and I have not spent much effort to save people. How can I be saved?" The doctor said to her, "Salvation is by the blood of the Lord and the redemption He has accomplished. We have no strength to save ourselves." He asked her to read John 6:47: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life." The doctor then said, "The Lord's word can never be false. He even says `truly, truly,' which means it must be true. What does He say those who believe in Him will have?" The young lady said, "Eternal life." He asked her again, "Since you have believed, do you have eternal life?" The young lady waited for a long time and then said, "The Bible says that I have eternal life, but I say I do not have eternal life." He said, "Which is more reliable, what you say, or what the Bible says?" At last she said with tears on her face, "I believe I have eternal life." From that time on, she became a happy person. Not long afterward, she passed away to the Lord who gave her eternal life.</P><P>O friends, I present this matter before you. The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to save sinners. He shed His precious blood to cleanse us from our sins. All those who believe in Him will not perish but will have eternal life. All your problems can be solved here. Today I only ask you, "Do you believe in Jesus?" All those who believe have eternal life.</P><P>Once I met a sister in Southeast Asia and asked if she believed in the Lord. She said, "I believe that Jesus can save me." I asked again, "Are you saved?" She said, "Sometimes I am saved; sometimes I am not. When I had a very good time reading the Bible, I considered that it would be wonderful if I would die then, because I believed at that time that I was saved. After a while when I got angry with my mother or quarreled with my younger brother, I felt that I had sinned, and I said to myself that I must not die. If I died then, I would certainly perish. Day after day, I switched between moments of good and bad, being saved and not being saved." I said to her, "Sister, you really must be the most capable person in the whole world. Within a day, you can go back and forth between heaven and hell many times. You are indeed capable. Who can be as capable as you are?" She said, "Do you mean to say that once I believe, I am a saved person?" I said, "What does God say in the Bible? God says those who believe have eternal life. No one can alter this Word, not even God. If you do not believe this Word, it means you do not believe that the Bible is the Word of God."</P><P>If a person does not understand the way to be saved, he cannot know whether or not he is saved. A person who wants to be saved must first know the conditions and the basis of salvation. If you do not understand the basis of salvation you cannot know whether you are saved. Once I was in Amoy discussing the matter of salvation with a great merchant there. We discussed it from nine o'clock in the evening to half past eleven o'clock, but the matter was still not settled. All the time he dared not say that he had eternal life. He said, "Three months ago, someone came here to preach the gospel and said that those who believe have eternal life. At that time I believed, and I put aside my sins; I thought that I was saved. But a month later my faith was gone, and I fell into great sins again. Does this not mean that I became unsaved? Now you are here. When I heard your preaching, I was revived again. But I am afraid that after you leave, in one or two months, I will become cold and backslidden again and become unsaved like before. Therefore, I cannot say that I am saved." I showed him many verses from the Scriptures and told him that the Word of God cannot be wrong and that one only has to believe. He was still not clear. In the end, I stood up to say goodbye to him, "Sir, I have to leave now because tomorrow I have meetings and some guests are waiting to see me. Therefore, we cannot continue. But let me say a final word. Are you saved by yourself or by the Lord Jesus?" Having said that, I began to walk away. After taking two steps, he called me back. I asked him why. He said, "We have talked for three to four hours, and I was not clear. But now I am clear. Being saved does not depend on good deeds in the past, nor on the good deeds in the future, but rather on whether or not one believes that Jesus bore his sins and died for him. No matter how many sins one has, these sins have all been put upon Him. As long as a man will believe, he will be saved. We are not saved by ourselves. We cannot save ourselves. It is the Lord Jesus who has saved us. Why then should I still say that I am not saved?" Finally, this man knew that he was saved. How happy we both were! The few hours spent in discussions and reading of the Scriptures were all useless. But the one word at the end gave him the understanding.</P><P>Many believers do not say that they are saved because they do not understand the basis of salvation. They think that all the misconduct in the past is put on Jesus, but that if one misbehaves after he has believed, he will perish. This is to revert back to the Old Testament position. In the New Testament, one is first given the standing; by faith one is first filled with the new life and then one comes before God with a true heart in full assurance of faith. One does not come to God by doing good. Rather, one comes to God based on the position he has received. This position will never be lost. Today many do not have the joy of salvation because they are trying to preserve their ongoing salvation with good works. Salvation does not come through a lifetime of labor; that will not save a person. If you ask a genuinely saved person how he is saved, he will definitely answer, "It is Jesus who saves me. I do not have any ability to save myself. It is all from the Lord." Only this kind of person will always rejoice.</P><P>The thief who was crucified at the same time as Christ was being crucified was saved right there on the cross immediately after he accepted the Lord. His salvation was based fully on the substitutionary death of Jesus. Suppose he did not die right after he was saved; suppose he lived fifty more years and did the best work like Paul, stood firm like Peter, or had the greatest love like John. Suppose he had all the virtues of Paul, Peter, and John added together. Could any of these virtues render help to his salvation to paradise at all? Would they make him more worthy of his salvation? No, they would not. Even if the thief stopped being a thief, even if he lived to do good and save others, and even if he became as good as the apostles, that still would not form the basis for his salvation. The only basis is the Lord Jesus; salvation does not depend on the behavior of the believers. This is why a believer can say that he is saved. It is after a man is saved that he conducts himself like the Lord did, being good and holy.</P><P>Suppose a person falls into water and others on the banks  save him and bring him up with great difficulty. They give him artificial respiration, a change of clothes, a burning fire to warm him, and something to eat so that he can live. Suppose you were to ask him, "Where are you now? Are you on the ground?" If he answers, "Though I am not in the water, I still feel that I am in the water. If I say I am now on the ground, it is too proud. I can only hope that I am on the ground!" Would you say that such a person is humble? This is not humility. Christ has saved the believers, yet if we still say, "I dare not say that I am saved; I still feel that I am in hell," we are too unreasonable!</P><P>When a person genuinely believes in Jesus as his Savior and in God's putting all his sins upon Him, but still says that he is not saved, this person is not humble; he is rather ungrateful for the exceeding grace of the Lord! He does not acknowledge the great work of the Lord's redemption and is saying that the Lord cannot fully save him! A Christian with this kind of thought will never praise God! I have never seen such a one utter thanks and songs of praises from his mouth! He does not know where he is going. No wonder he cannot praise or give glory to God. A person going to hell or a person who does not know that he has eternal life surely cannot praise God. It is pitiful that the praises that are due do not exist in the mouths of many Christians! Only those who know that they are saved can praise and thank the Lord! Who will praise God in Hades? Hell is filled with curses! It never has a word of praise. If you do not praise God now, when will you praise Him?</P><P>Some people say, "There is a danger in saying that once a person believes, he has eternal life and is saved and will never perish, because if a person knows that he is saved anyway, he may do whatever he wants, not be careful about anything, or not have a fearful heart." Those who say this do not know God's way of salvation and grace. Please note that the salvation as recorded in the Scriptures includes objective and subjective aspects. The Lord was crucified on the cross. God said that those who believe in Him will not go to hell but are justified and fully saved because all their sins have been put on the cross, and their sins are fully forgiven. This is the objective aspect. At the same time, within the Lord's salvation, there is also the subjective work. He has crucified on the cross the life which once loved sin, filthiness, and uncleanness. At the same time, He has given us His life-the new life. This is subjective salvation. The Lord not only saves us objectively, but He Himself also regenerates us. We are not only forgiven but also regenerated. God has put a new life and a new spirit inside us. Every believer has the Holy Spirit living within him, so that he knows what is good, what should be done, and what is right. His life is a good and joyful one. There is no one whose sins have been forgiven and who has the life of God who will feel that a holy life is a suffering and is not good. Formerly he dared not commit evil openly because he was afraid of having a bad name or reputation. Now he does not commit evil because he knows that these are sins, and that the sins themselves and their nature are stinky and filthy. Now he sees sins as something repulsive. In addition, he has the Holy Spirit dwelling within him, and he dares not do evil.</P><P>If a person has believed in the Lord and continues to sin without any hatred towards sin, this shows that he has not yet been regenerated. An unregenerated person does not have life and is not saved. God has not only given us objective salvation, but He has also given us subjective salvation. If any man thinks he has a new life and is regenerated, yet continues to sin, his faith is not genuine, and he is not really regenerated. God's life causes us not to sin. Therefore, a believer does not have to sin. Please grasp these words firmly. A believer not only has objective salvation, but also the subjective life that does not sin.</P><P>No traveler would decorate and furnish his temporary lodging beautifully and perfectly only to stay for a few days or months and then leave it to go to another place. Men only decorate, furnish, beautify, and make comfortable a permanent home; no one would furnish a temporary lodging too well, because he will not live there for long. I had a classmate who never dressed properly. His hair was very long, his face was not washed, his whole body was dirty, and he never put on proper shoes. Everyone said that he was eccentric, and those who walked with him were disgusted with him. Two years later I met him on the street. He was clean-shaven and wearing a proper suit, and his hair was nicely combed. I hardly recognized him, and I said to myself, "Is this my ex-classmate?" We had been classmates for seven years; I knew that he dressed very poorly and did not care for his appearance. Later he talked with me and asked me about life in some foreign countries and the etiquette of those countries. I was really amazed that a most casual person wanted to start learning foreign etiquette. I could not help but go to his uncle to ask the reason. I found out that he was going abroad to study very soon. This was why he started to dress well and learn etiquette. A person going to a foreign country to study would stay there for only two or three years; he would not stay there forever. Yet this person would dress up in a suit, speak with an accent, care for manners, and inquire about life in a foreign country. He was only going there to study for a few years, yet he had such a good preparation. How about us believers who will in the future live eternally in the bright, glorious, beautiful, and excellent heavenly home? Should we not all the more prepare and learn the heavenly life and manner? Is there such a person who would purposely make Chinese long gowns when he is getting ready to go to a foreign country because he thinks that, after he is in the Western country, he will not have the chance to wear this kind of clothes anymore and that he must therefore take all the opportunities to wear them while he can? Needless to say, we all know that there is not such a thing.</P><P>Every believer knows that he is saved, and it will not be long before he will be back to his home in heaven where he will see his heavenly Father. Would he still think, "There will be no more opportunity to sin in heaven, so while I am still on earth, I had better sin more and taste sins more. I had better be bound by sins more and suffer the bitterness of sins more"? Do you think that this is reasonable? This is surely unreasonable. Let us realize that we will all go to the heavenly home and will dwell in that beautiful city. Since we are saved now, we should surely forsake the pleasures of sin and the lusts of the flesh; we should not allow these things to hinder us or obstruct our way. May we know that since we are saved and have the life of God, we should express God's life and should let others know that we are saved. May we testify much before man so that more people can be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW BOOK:<br>QUESTIONS ON THE GOSPEL </H2><P>This book will not be ready until summer.

In both instances, the Lord asked a question of the disciples. In both cases the Lord's question was the same. In Luke He asked, "Do you have anything here to eat?" In John He said, "You do not have any fish to eat, do you?" The meaning in both cases is the same. He wanted to find out if they had anything to eat. Luke 24 says that they had something, while John 21 says that they had nothing.</P><P>In Luke, the disciples only gave the Lord a piece of broiled fish. By then, the disciples might have finished their meal, and only had a piece of broiled fish left over, and they gave it to the Lord. Many times, the Lord asks us for something to eat. We may be like the disciples, who had only a piece of broiled fish. That was all that they had.</P><P>In John, the disciples did not have anything, yet the Lord prepared fish and bread for them. The Lord did not give them just fish, but bread as well. Many times we are like the disciples, laboring all night without catching anything. In our despair and weariness, the Lord asks us if we have anything to eat. We have to admit that we have nothing. But the Lord has something. He not only has fish, but bread as well to satisfy us.</P><P>Why did the disciples have fish when they were in the room (Luke 24) but not when they were at sea (John 21)? Here we see one thing: the Lord's intention was for the disciples to wait in the city for the coming of the Holy Spirit (Luke 24:49). The house was the place where they should have been. This was why they still had a little fish. But they had no knowledge of the Lord's resurrection and went to the sea to fish. They wanted to return to their old way. In the end, they did not have even a piece of broiled fish. They did not catch anything because the fishing was done outside of God's ordained will. While they remained in the house, they may not have been perfect, but they still had a piece of broiled fish, and they still had something to give to the Lord. We should find out if the place we are and the labor we have expended are according to God's will. If we act according to our own will, we will be like the disciples who received nothing for the whole night and had nothing to eat. Whenever we are at a place that is far away from the Lord, we have nothing.</P><P>The Lord asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" It seems as if the Lord was hungry. When the Lord was hungry, could they satisfy Him? Brothers and sisters, what do we have that can satisfy the Lord? The Lord is seeking, and He is looking for something from us that will satisfy Him. He is waiting for us to satisfy Him. "And they handed Him a piece of broiled fish." It seems as if they were saying, "Lord, we have something. We are full and have some leftovers, something that we were saving for tomorrow. But we will give this little bit to You." The Lord Jesus "took it and ate before them." Whatever we consecrate to Him, even if it is just a little, the Lord will accept. He will accept everything that we consecrate to Him. As long as there is a little intention within our heart to say, "Lord, this is for You," He will accept it. As long as there is a small voice within us which says, "Lord, this is for You," He will take it.</P><P>Those who did not even have a piece of fish were the ones who spent their whole night fishing at the sea. That night, seven people were fishing at sea, but they caught nothing. They had returned to their old way, but they caught nothing. We have to remember that when we have nothing to eat and to give to the Lord, it means that we are away from the Lord's way and doing things apart from the Lord's ordained will. Otherwise, we would not be so poor that we would not even have a piece of broiled fish. All those who have no fish, who have nothing to consecrate and nothing to satisfy the Lord with, must have tried to satisfy themselves first and walked according to their own will. If one labors according to his own will, he will not even have a piece of fish; he will not even be able to satisfy himself. But when a man realizes that he is rebelling against God and has not satisfied the Lord's heart in the way he is taking, and then he drops his past ways and stops his erring footsteps, he may not be able to give much to the Lord, but the Lord will have much to give to him. Although he may not be able to give much to the Lord, the Lord will have fish and bread ready for him; under these circumstances, He will satisfy him. Therefore, brothers, please turn! Although you may have been wrong in the past, you can stop your footsteps today and tell the Lord, "Lord, I have turned back." When you turn back to the Lord, He will satisfy you! You may not be worthy, but He has the grace. He will supply you, fill you, and comfort you.</P><P>If we can give a little to the Lord, let us give it to Him. Although we have only a little gift that may be insignificant, we should give it to the Lord. Even if we have nothing to give to Him today, we should be satisfied with His grace. We may not have anything to give to Him, but He has a rich supply reserved for us. The most pitiful thing is holding back a little piece of broiled fish and not giving it to the Lord. The most pitiful thing for us is laboring a whole night when the Lord has abundant grace freely reserved for us. Let us give the Lord our little piece of broiled fish, and let us satisfy Him. May we receive fish and bread from His hand and be satisfied with them. May we satisfy the Lord, and may the Lord satisfy us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A MESSAGE BY THE BROTHERS<br>FROM NORTHERN KIANGSU</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18<br>(Given in Shanghai on June 11, 1931)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TESTIMONY BY MR. WU WEI</H2><P>Today I thank God for giving me the opportunity to meet all the brothers and sisters here. Today I will give a testimony and some teaching. During the conference in February 1928, three brothers came from Kiangsu. They were Brother Chi Yung-tung, Brother Chiu Re-jian, and myself. During that time no one told me anything specifically about leaving the denominations; I was enlightened and brought to an understanding of the matter through my reading of the books. (Mr. Nee did not mention this subject at all.) At that time I was definitely touched by the truth, and God was working in me in a particular way. Because of that, I have the opportunity today to testify concerning what has happened during the past three years.</P><P>What we experienced three years ago was the same as today; we had Mr. Nee preaching to us then. I think you are all very fortunate here. I was a member of a Presbyterian Church. During the conference, someone mentioned to me the matter of baptism and how one should meet according to the teaching of 1 Corinthians 14. When I heard the truth, I was troubled, and after the conference I was baptized. On that day five people were baptized together, including the three of us, another brother from Pingyang and one brother from Anhwei. After the conference I returned home with Brother Chiu, while Brother Chi remained in Shanghai for a few more days. While I was on my way, I wrote a letter of resignation to my denomination. At that time I struggled with two things. First, I was deeply acquainted with the elders in my locality. Second, I was the first one to be saved in my locality. I was afraid that by resigning, I would be misunderstood and slandered. But for the truth's sake, I had to obey. In my prayer, I received James 4:17, which says, "Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin." Since I knew it, I should act accordingly. If I did not act, I would be sinning. Subsequently, I did not consider the possible outward consequences and wrote a letter to my elders requesting to be removed from their list and to resign from my post as an elder. I mentioned four things in my letter: (1) one should worship according to the scriptural principles, (2) there should be the breaking of bread meetings, (3) I should be baptized, and (4) there should not be human organizations and denominational names. At the same time, Mr. Chi also wrote a letter from Shanghai requesting to be removed from their list and to resign from his preaching post. When his letter arrived, my letter also arrived. But our denomination did not give us an answer right away because they had to discuss the matter in their convention.</P><P>There was great turmoil within the Presbyterian Church because of this. People began to call together a convention to discuss this matter. In the end, they sent five representatives to me to persuade me to stay and told me that they were willing to follow two and a half of the four points I mentioned. The two and a half points were regarding the worship according to the principles of the Scripture. The elders and the preachers were allowed to administer the bread. As for baptism, those who had been sprinkled did not need to be baptized again, but those who had not been sprinkled could be baptized. As to the removing of the name, the convention had discussions about it and concluded that this could not be done. Furthermore, we were told that we should not resign from our post as elders and preachers. At that time the Scriptures that the Lord gave to me were 2 Corinthians 6:17: "Therefore come out from their midst and be separated," and Acts 5:29: "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." When we considered these two verses, we were happy to put aside human relationships and make the decision to leave. When they realized that our minds were set and that they could not stop us, some ill feelings arose and there was some slander, misunderstanding, and criticism. Brother Chi's home is in Su Chia-chui, which is thirty miles from my home, Yi-lin. He returned home. In his locality there was a meeting established by him and his brother already. In my locality another brother, Shu Shou-yue, joined me to leave the denomination. I was afraid that this brother left not for the sake of the truth, but for the sake of our friendship together. However, later I found out that this was not the case, and we began to have the breaking of bread meeting in Brother Shu's home.</P><P>At that time I felt very lonely and hoped to receive some help from letters from the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. Later Mr. Nee did send me a letter, but when I opened it, there were only these words: "Press on towards the mark, though lonely, unchanged!" This was a line quoted from a hymn in the Little Flock Hymnal. I was expecting some words of comfort or help. But there were only these words, and my heart sank. At that time I only had human concepts. However, after praying and considering these words, I received much help, and these words became a source of strength to me. We are in the Lord, and He is leading us to press toward the mark. For this reason we are not lonely.</P><P>Later more came to our meeting, and those who used to oppose us began to join us. We felt that we needed a place for meeting, and the Lord prepared a place for us which was a house I had prepared for myself during that period of time. We began to have the breaking of bread meeting there. We were not the only ones to do that. Mr. Chi and Mr. Chiu began to have the same kind of meeting in their localities. There was a Mr. Ding Yi-yuen from Dah-chiao, who was a preacher in Dah-chiao. He also left the denominations and began to meet with them. In this way, the four of us began to work together for the Lord in one accord. The Lord gave us different gifts to serve Him. Sinners were saved, and some also left the denominations to meet with us. But at the same time, there was much talk about us.</P><P>Once the Presbyterians had a conference in Salt City. One pastor quoted the words of Gamaliel in Acts 5, saying that if this move was of man, it would be overthrown, but that if it was from God, no one could overthrow it; instead, it would prosper. The words of this pastor opened a way for us. Not only were we not persecuted or slandered anymore, but the words actually testified for us. And not only did they testify for us, they opened a way for us to work in Salt City and other places. Soon, in five different places, there was the breaking of bread meeting with the number exceeding two hundred. The Lord raised up responsible ones from each locality who carried out the work God assigned to them, according to the gifts they received from Him. This is the condition and news of Kiangsu during the past three years. I have now finished my testimony. I am merely testifying for the Lord's truth. If any brother or sister here has heard the truth, they should obey. Now we have about two hundred people meeting. We dare not boast about ourselves; we are merely thanking God for His grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Report on the Kiangsu Storm Disaster</H2><P>March 22nd of this year was a Lord's Day. On that day, we had our storm disaster. A few days before that, Mr. Chi and I had the intention to visit the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. The reason for our visit was that we were co-workers in the Lord and we felt this was something we should do. On the afternoon of March 22nd, Mr. Chi's eldest son came to Yi-lin from Su Chia-chui and told me that Mr. Chi would come that day, or at the latest by the next day, to join me to travel to Shanghai. But the same afternoon at 6 p.m., the temperature suddenly rose and a great storm with rain came. Thunder, lightning, and hail appeared. It was like a great earthquake. I wondered if the Lord was coming and began to pray with my family, saying, "Lord, are You coming? If You are coming, will we be raptured?" Later, when I realized that it was not the Lord's coming, I began to be concerned if the brothers and sisters would suffer from the storm.</P><P>Within a short time, men from my shop came and told me that four of the houses on my street had blown down. My shop was outside the city, while my house was on a street inside the city. I could not take care of much. I knew that the storm would go away the next day. But the next morning, some people came again from my shop and said that many more houses had collapsed and insisted that I should go and take a look. I had to go. At the same time, I was afraid that the houses of Brother Chi and Brother Chiu had suffered from the same disaster. Soon, some came with the report that the houses of these two brothers had completely collapsed, and that the three-year-old son of Brother Chi had been killed in the collapse. I wanted to visit them and take a look at the area after the disaster, but the wind was still strong. I still could not travel there with my bicycle, so I waited until the next day. On the morning of the 24th, I arrived in Su Chia-chui and saw the terrible condition, and I comforted them a little.</P><P>Had we left for Shanghai during this storm, it would have been more unbearable for the others. Fortunately we remained at home. At that time we prayed together to seek God's will and consider what to do concerning the damaged houses. Those who prayed with me were Brother Ding Yi-yuen and Brother Hsu Shou-yue. At the end of our prayer, we became clear that these houses could be repaired and did not need to be torn down. I moved the wives and children of Brother Chi and Brother Chiu to my home, for they all had some minor injuries. Brother Chi can give you details of the storm disaster because he went through it himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. MR. CHI YUNG-TUNG'S TESTIMONY</H2><P>Why do I have to mention the condition in our area today? There are three reasons: (1) we are brothers and sisters in the Lord together, (2) we have the same faith, and (3) we want to express our gratitude for the help of love you have rendered to us. Hence, we would like to give you a report.</P><P>The storm has passed. Why then do we have to mention it again? It is to thank the Lord and consider the lessons He has taught us in the past. Although what we experienced was the attack of the devil, it also was something that God permitted. The story of Job is our example.</P><P>Personally, I felt two things concerning this episode. First, I inquired before God as to what mistakes I have made and what sins I have committed. If I had some mistakes or sins, it was God's chastisement of me. It is better to suffer God's chastisement now than to be judged by Him later. Second, this episode relates to the message we preach. We have to preach the coming of the Lord more. In the future we should preach this message even more.</P><P>Our experience at that time was similar to that of the coming of the Lord. According to our study of the coming of the Lord, there will be a great tribulation on earth, and some believers will be raptured before the tribulation comes. During the tribulation, some believers will have to go through calamities and some will die in them. When I consider my family and the suffering they suffered in this disaster, the picture was similar to the Lord's coming. Our teaching of the Bible and our last experience has all the more confirmed the condition of the Lord's coming.</P><P>On that evening, our whole family was eating together happily. After dinner I felt to go and visit someone. Two minutes after I left home, I saw a black cloud in the west. Following this, a black wind mixed with straw and hay blew this way. I knew that a storm disaster was coming, but I went ahead, thinking of my family all the time. When I looked back, the black wind had reached us, and the whole sky was darkened. It was like the picture described in the exodus from Egypt. My ears could only hear the sound of the wind and the rumbling of houses blown under the sand and the hay. I could not touch the ground with my hands. At that time I could only pray, "Lord, save me!" Not only was I praying, even those who usually did not pray began to pray. This is the normal reaction of men in peril. I knew the streets in that area very well, and so I fumbled in darkness on my way home. The houses around where we lived were very shaken.</P><P>Later I tried to return home. But just then, the wind blew off the roof of my home and the house where we were meeting. Both my house as well as Mr. Chiu's house collapsed. When I arrived at the front door, I saw that the roof was gone. Upon entering the house, I heard crying everywhere. The house had fallen and was in shambles, and my wife and the children were huddled together. Mrs. Chiu was trapped under the debris. The roof of the meeting hall was gone. At that time, my wife told me that our youngest one was still trapped under the debris in the house. I tried to look for him under the pile with a lamp, and eventually, I found my child dead.</P><P>At that time there were over ten people in the house. One was killed. I believe that God's will was in the matter; otherwise, my son would not have died. I asked my wife and children how they had escaped. They said that they did not know. By the time they heard the sound of the wind, the house had already collapsed, and they were all trapped. My youngest son was killed by a beam that fell on him. I consider that two sparrows are worth more than an assarion and not one of them falls to the earth apart from the Father. My son's death was surely of the Father's will. At that time Mr. Chiu was standing by his door. When the wind came, the house fell back and did not crush him; he was only slightly injured. Mrs. Chiu was afraid that the house would be torn down and was jumping out of the bed with the baby in her arms when the house collapsed. She was trapped inside. But the amazing thing was that they were not hurt because there was a pole next to her bed, and the falling beam fell right on the pole. They were trapped under the two poles and were unharmed. Brothers and sisters, this is the real story. The Lord has blessed us. Indeed, He has blessed us. The God whom we serve is a living God. He is with us in everything.</P><P>After this incident, we had strong winds coming our way many times. Every night, everyone was afraid of the wind, but Mrs. Chiu had much faith. She said that had she not trusted in God, she would not have been able to sleep for fear of the collapse of the house. Mr. Chiu has a daughter who became very fearful of the wind after this incident. As soon as she hears the wind, she says, "The storm is here, the storm is here." Even now she is still not mentally sound. I was different because I did not experience the damage. Mr. Chiu was also slightly injured. Personally, I was taught and comforted at the thought of the possibility of being raptured before the tribulation! Before I left my house, my whole family was happily together. A few minutes later, I returned home and saw the wreckage. The house was originally quite well built, but after the wind came, it was totally damaged. This was similar to the verses in the Bible that say when men say peace and security, sudden destruction comes upon them. At a time when we are not prepared, the Lord will come. If we are not prepared, we will not be raptured. What good are the things which we love and crave in this world? Others were afraid of the wind, but I was not afraid of it. The reason is that they passed through the damage, but I did not pass through any damage. They did not die in the disaster, but they came through the disaster. I consider the fact that some believers will be saved, though as through the fire. During the tribulation the world will suffer calamities and dangers. When the Lord comes back, there will be believers who will be raptured. Some will go through the tribulation, and some will die in the tribulation. This is a picture of the church of God.</P><P>After that incident, I said to my family and children, not in the way of teaching, that the Lord has kept them on earth because they have grown up and have a will to choose to believe in the Lord Jesus and receive life. If they would not accept the Lord and receive life, they might not have another chance for salvation. The Lord allowed them to pass through the disaster in order that they would become fearful and consider what they would do during the few years of the great tribulation which is coming. This is why they have to hurry and receive the Lord. As for my dead child, he was only three years old and was not able to make his own choice. As such, even though he is dead, he is saved. Was it not God's grace that the children who have the ability to make a choice are not dead?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning the Work</H2><P>Although we have left [the denominations], we are only separated from them as far as regulations are concerned. Humanly speaking and as far as our relationship in the Lord is concerned, there is still no distinction between them and us. We have no opinions or prejudice against those in the denominations. In our meetings there are visitors from the denominations, both Chinese and Westerners. Moreover, we left not because of Mr. Nee's words but because we were led by God's Word.</P><P>Here, we have much opportunity to hear about the inner leading of the Holy Spirit. But for us, in addition to hearing about it, we have the experience of seeing the Holy Spirit working within us and teaching us directly in our intuition. Sometimes we do not understand such leadings and are weak, but He is within us and teaching us all things. This is the word of 1 John 2:27. I used to think that the Holy Spirit gave us feelings from outside. Since the conference, however, I realize that the Holy Spirit works within us. All we have to do is to go along with the inner leading. If the Holy Spirit has not given us any leading, we should not move rashly. At that time, I only knew that this teaching was right, but today I am allowing the Holy Spirit to work in me day by day. Our leaving the denomination and all the works we did after we left were the works of the Holy Spirit within us. It would be dangerous if we trusted in our own work. Of course, we were not without mistakes during the past few years. If there were any mistakes, we ask for the cleansing and forgiveness of the Lord's blood. Everything that remains is the result of the Lord's work within us. Everything that is initiated by the Holy Spirit will remain until that day.</P><P>The help we have received came from the book The Spiritual Man. The book did not teach us some outward teachings; every point in it can be experienced. Some among us had already experienced something similar to what is described in the book. Whatever little work that we can testify for the Lord today is the result of the Holy Spirit's work within us; nothing comes out of our imagination, arrangement, or method.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning Spiritual Warfare</H2><P>Spiritual warfare is not a knowledge. During the past few years, the devil has been attacking us directly. We experienced the spiritual warfare. It is not a teaching but a tangible warfare. The teaching concerning the devil is real. Sometimes the devil would attack us directly, and sometimes he would attack us indirectly. Sometimes he would attack the church, and sometimes, individuals. At times we were in darkness, but the book The Spiritual Man helped us. The teaching in that book reminded us that what is inside of us is greater than what is in the world. Every time that we fight with the devil and are about to be defeated, we are reminded of the words of the book that we will win as long as we stand. When we do this, we overcome. I remember Mr. Nee once said that when our works are attacked by the enemy, it proves that the enemy is sensing his defeat. The times when we feel most troubled is the very time when the devil is defeated. Indeed, many times, when we do not have any way to go on, a way is opened; many times when we do not have the light, light comes from somewhere. The Lord has indeed helped us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning the Church</H2><P>We experienced no difficulty within the past few years. The church is not established by man or erected through donations. Formerly, churches were raised up through men's donations; they were established by men, mostly foreigners. Now there is hope with the churches in China. For example, after Brother Wu left his denomination in Yi-lin, he did not leave the Lord; instead, he offered his house to the Lord for the use of meeting. The meeting in Su Chia-chui also experiences no difficulty. In addition, in the rural areas the Lord has raised up responsible ones. For example, in Chan-chia-shue-tse, there is now a meeting raised up. They are much advanced spiritually. Although they have only twenty or more people, there is no difficulty among them. One brother by the name of Chan voluntarily came to me and asked to start the breaking of bread meeting in his home. He said that the Lord convicted them that they should meet together. When I heard the conviction in his voice, I realized that the matter was of the Lord. Chan-chia-shue-tse is fifteen miles away from Su Chia-chui. Some brothers who live in another place seven miles from Chan-chia-shue-tse also wanted to have the Lord's table. The Lord's table at Chan-chia-shue-tse was very suitable because it was centrally located. For that reason, I agreed that they should go ahead and have the meeting.</P><P>Do you know what kind of a person Mr. Chan was? He was an illiterate person. He could not read but was quite wealthy. The produce from his fifteen acres of land was enough to support his whole family year round. Yet he stood for the Lord and began to have meetings in his home. Every Lord's Day, he and his wife cleaned up the table and opened up three rooms in his house for the Lord's table meeting. He could not read at first, but during the past two years, he began to read the Bible and sing hymns. On the Lord's Day he even stood up to give messages. He is indeed the messenger of that local church. This really touched us. Although they have not visited other places and although they do not have any organization, the Lord is among them.</P><P>Once we had a seven-day conference in Su Chia-chui. After the meeting he told me that he wanted to have a seven-day Bible study in his locality and the dates were set. I said, "If you wanted us to take care of the meeting, you should have waited until we were clear before you set the date." He told us that they were going to meet on their own and were not inviting us to speak. I asked if he had the burden. He said that he felt he did. I was afraid that he would not be able to bear it, yet I was afraid to stop him, so I said, "Since you have the burden, go ahead and do it." By the time the Bible study came, I went to visit them. I saw him standing up to teach the Bible, and those who heard him were helped by him. I was deeply touched. After two days, I had to go to another place for some other business and did not stay until the end of that conference. However, I do feel that as long as something is of the Lord, He will raise up the right people. As long as one or two people are willing to consecrate to the Lord, He will use them. The Lord's church has no difficulty. We do not have to spend money to hire a preacher.</P><P>The condition among us is indeed like that of the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3. When I left the denomination, I was afraid of two things:</P><P>(1) I was afraid that no one would come to meet with us. But the Lord showed me one verse, "I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut" (Rev. 3:8). Different denominations have invited us to work in their places. When they saw what we were doing, they searched the Scriptures and felt that what we were doing was right. Their conscience could not oppose us. They admitted that their practices were different from the principles in the Bible. They had nothing to say against us.</P><P>(2) I was afraid to take the way of faith. I was hired by the denomination to be a preacher, but I had difficulty sustaining myself even when I took up other jobs in addition to my preaching. When I left my denomination, I was five hundred dollars in debt. I thought that when I left the denomination, I would be left penniless. But the Lord was working in me. I had to obey and leave the denomination. Although the future was unclear then, in the end there was the light. Now, not only have I repaid the five hundred dollars, but I have experienced no lack at all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. MR. NEE'S COMMENTS</H2><P>We do not formulate our own ideas or our own ways concerning the question of the church. Our purpose is not to set up a new denomination. Our only purpose is to meet under the name of Christ and not under the name of a place, person, or method. We are not Presbyterian which is under an office of the presbytery. We are not Congregationalist which is under the name of a method. We are not Wesleyans or Lutherans which are under the names of persons. We are not the China Inland Mission which is under the name of a place. We are not Baptists which is under the name of a ritual. We do not want to put the Lord's name under any person's name. We are jealous that the Lord's name not be put under any other name.</P><P>We do not have a denomination, and we do not have a membership list. We do not belong to the "Church of Hardoon Road," and we are not a member of it. We are meeting under the name of Christ, and no one can be separated from Christ.</P><P>Many people think that those who preach in Shanghai can live by God, while those who preach in the rural countryside cannot live by God, and that they will die of starvation if they try. I also live by God. Allow me to say an honest word-this is not to shame you-if I had to live by the believers in Shanghai, I would have died long ago. I do not live by the believers in Shanghai, but I live very much by the believers in the countryside whom God has used. The amount the believers in Shanghai have supported me with is only one-tenth of my monthly expenses. Our Sister Wang and Sister Liu came back from Kiangsu and told us that they offered beyond their ability. This is not only true with Kiangsu. The Lord has raised up over thirty meetings that meet under His name in Pingyang and southern Fukien. According to my knowledge, there are now over sixty people in China who are living by God. Brother Chi had a debt of five hundred dollars. He is not only clear of his debt now, but he is not living in any want. God gives the Spirit without measure to those who will obey Him (John 3:34). The Lord has worked through them to help and save many people. Even their enemies are turned into friends. Members of the local denomination in Yi-lin as well as the preacher tried to hand over their chapel to Mr. Wu. The preacher was willing to resign. This shows us the effect of the work. Brother Wu and Brother Chi occupied important positions in the denomination. Brother Wu was an elder there, and Brother Chi was a preacher. But they obeyed God. God will commit His work to those who obey Him. Even I am encouraged by them and stirred up to become zealous.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MEANING OF BAPTISM</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 22:16; Rom. 6:3-4</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANING OF BAPTISM</H2><P>Today we will consider a special subject: the meaning of baptism. We will not spend any time to find out what baptism is and is not. Rather, we will specifically consider the meaning of baptism, the biblical teaching concerning it, and the emphasis in baptism. Why does the Bible tell us that we should be baptized? First, we will ask why a person needs to wash himself in water. He washes because his body is unclean. Because there is dirt on his body or on his feet, he has to wash. No one goes to the water to make himself unclean. Men go to the water to clean themselves; otherwise, they would not go into the water. Therefore, the first meaning of baptism according to the Bible is to be washed clean. If one does not want to be clean, he does not have to be baptized.</P><P>Furthermore, when do we throw things into the water? When do we throw a basket of manure or rubbish into the water? We throw them into water when we do not want them, when we want to dispose of them. The second meaning of baptism according to the Bible is to bury, to dispose of, something. When we do not want something, we bury it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WASHING AWAY OF SINS</H2><P>We have just read two passages of the Scriptures. What does Acts say? When Ananias was sent by the Holy Spirit, he saw a clear vision. He was told to rise up to meet Saul of Tarsus and say to him, "And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name." Why do we have to be baptized? What is the purpose of baptism? The purpose is to wash away our sins.</P><P>Many people misunderstand this verse. Some time ago, two brothers from Kiangsu came and asked me about this verse, saying, "This verse tells us to wash away our sins. Some have asked us if their sins are washed away if they are not baptized." Many people have the same misunderstanding. The Bible clearly tells us to wash away our sins, but what does it mean?</P><P>The Bible tells us that baptism is not a ritual. It tells us that being baptized is to bear witness before men. What do we do when we go into the water? When we go into the water, we are testifying before God, before men, before the angels, and before the devil that we have believed in Jesus, and that our sins are forgiven and washed away. Baptism is a confession before God, men, angels, and the devil that Christ has accomplished a real, complete, and reliable fact for us. Being baptized is showing and testifying to this fact.</P><P>Ananias told Saul to rise up and be baptized. Why did he have to be baptized? It was to wash away his sins. Ananias was not saying that baptism can wash away sins. Baptism itself cannot wash a man of his sins. The thing that baptism testifies of and demonstrates is what washes away man's sins. No water on earth can wash away any of man's sins. But the Lord's blood, testified of and demonstrated by the baptismal water, washes away all of man's sins. Have you believed? If you have believed, you should rise up and be baptized immediately, washing away your sins. The first meaning of baptism is to wash away sins.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, no one who is filthy in God's eyes and whose sins are not yet forgiven can be baptized. No one should be baptized who is ignorant of the fact that his sins are washed away and that he has eternal life and is saved. For such a one to be baptized is wrong. Every man who goes into the water must know what he is testifying of. What is a testimony? It is seeing and testifying. In other words, it is testifying what one sees. First one sees and then one testifies. Those who have not seen anything cannot testify. A man must know that his sins are forgiven and washed by the blood of the Lord before he can testify before men that his sins are washed away.</P><P>From this we can see that infant baptism is wrong. If a person who is being baptized cannot testify, his baptism cannot be counted as a baptism. Any baptism performed on an unbeliever or on anyone before he believes is unreliable and means nothing. Only those who can testify that their sins are forgiven and washed away are qualified to be baptized. What a man does in the water is to testify to the accomplished works of Christ and that his sins are forgiven.</P><P>Last Lord's Day we pointed out that as soon as a person believes, he knows if he is saved. After a man knows that he is saved and that his sins are forgiven, what should he do? He should testify. Where should he testify? The first place to testify is in the water. This testimony is before God, before men, before the angels, and before the devil. It is a testimony that one's sins are washed away. This is the first meaning of baptism. It is also the condition for baptism.</P><P>If a person's sins are not washed away, he is not qualified to be baptized. He must fully know that his sins are forgiven before he is qualified to be baptized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO ASPECTS OF SIN</H2><P>The Bible is most amazing in the way it is written. I have said this before and I will say it again that there are two aspects to sin, and there are two aspects to the way God deals with sin. The Bible tells us that there is a difference between sins and sin; one is before God, and the other is within us. Our sins before God have to be forgiven and washed away, while sin within us must be overcome, and we must be delivered from it. Our sins before God have been borne by the Lord Jesus, but the sin within us can only be removed through reckoning ourselves as dead. For the sins before God, we have the washing of the Lord's blood. For the sin within us, there is the need for the deliverance of the Lord's cross. We need God's forbearance and forgiveness for our sins before Him, and we need freedom and deliverance from the sin within us. These two aspects of sin are entirely different. Today, we can only briefly consider the difference between these two aspects of sin. The Lord willing, we will discuss them in detail later.</P><P>For now, I will not mention the difference in the nature of sin and sins; we will only consider the difference in the effect of these two aspects. First, let us consider our sins before God. Our sins before God give us no peace in our conscience. Whenever we think of judgment, hell, death, and questions related to man's end, we feel that we have sinned before God. Whenever we think of God's holiness, righteousness, and His ordination, we become fearful. Today, those who are sitting here who have not received Jesus as their Savior surely have this kind of experience. If they do not have this experience, I feel sorry for them because this means that they are ignorant, insensitive, and unaware of their own danger. Anyone with a little thoughtfulness will feel at a loss and not have peace when they consider Hades, death, hell, eternity, God's judgment, or sin. The reason for this is that they are sinners before God, and as long as their sin is not removed, they will not dare to think about these things. Once they consider these things, they realize that they will go into the lake of fire and suffer eternally. They fear and have no peace. This tells us that we are sinners before God. Our sins before God cause us to have no peace and to be afraid to think about such things as judgment, end times, and death.</P><P>But man not only has sins before God, he also has sin in himself. A seminary student once said to his teacher, "I have found one new thing in the Bible today, which is the doctrine of sin. Of course, the Bible mentions it. But I did not see it until today." The teacher said, "Have you only discovered the doctrine of sin from the Bible today? I found that out from man's heart long ago." There is no need to go to the Bible to find the doctrine of sin; we can find it easily from man's heart. Everyone can testify that sin is not only before God but is also within us.</P><P>We may lose our temper easily. We may think that outward things are causing us to lose our temper. Actually, all the outward things do not give us our temper, but a burning within causes our temper to burst out. We may try to suppress it by force. But we cannot do it; as soon as there is an opportunity, the temper will burst out again. When there is an explosion, we cannot blame it all on the sparks of fire; there must first be explosives. Sins issue from within. Many people think that the reason their thoughts are unclean and filled with sins is that they have read unhealthy books which entice them to sin. But many times when the environment is clean and excellent, and there are no temptations anywhere, is our heart clean? A young man said that he had read too many novels and that his mind was filled with evil and unclean thoughts. He asked if there was any way to cleanse his thoughts. Can we get rid of the unclean things within us just by shaking our heads? Can that be done? I can tell you that nothing will shake these things out from you.</P><P>Sin dwells within man. It has roots, and they cannot be removed. Many sinners like to gamble or smoke opium. Certain outward factors are not seducing them into such acts, but an inward sin is pressing them to act this way. Sin has its punishment before God and its power within man. It causes us to do things we are not willing to do. Even if we try to suppress it with all our power and will to keep it from breaking out, when an opportunity is there, it breaks out just the same. This is the true condition of man. Sin reigns within man. We are its slaves. It has the power to snatch us away and cause us to do that which we are not willing to do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO ASPECTS OF DELIVERANCE</H2><P>Since there are the two aspects of sin, the aspect before God and the aspect before men, there are also two aspects of deliverance. There is the punishment of sin and the power of sin. Therefore, there are two aspects of deliverance. This does not mean that there are two deliverances; it means that there are two aspects of deliverance. The Lord delivers us from fear, punishment, the condemnation in the conscience, and all unrest. At the same time, He delivers us from the power of sin. The Lord's deliverance is complete. He saves us from God's punishment and from the power of sin.</P><P>How did the Lord die to deliver us from the two aspects of sin? The Bible tells us that a sinner has to die. The Lord bore the punishment of death for us. He shed His blood to redeem us and wash us of all our sins before God. The Lord's blood cleanses us. It is amazing that the Bible never tells us that the Lord's blood cleanses our heart. Who can find a verse that says that the Lord's blood cleanses our heart? Some may say that Hebrews 9:14 says that the Lord's blood cleanses our heart. But it says that the blood cleanses our conscience, not our heart. I can honestly tell you that there is no place in the whole Bible that says that the blood cleanses our heart. It only says that the blood cleanses our conscience. What is the conscience? The conscience is the part within us that condemns us, that tells us that we are wrong and deserve to perish. The Lord's blood only cleanses our conscience from condemnation and brings peace. The Lord's blood shows us that even though our sins deserve punishment, the Lord has died for our sins and accomplished God's righteousness. However, through the cleansing of the Lord's blood, we cannot become moral and sin no more or be released from sin. The Lord's blood can only cleanse us before God and remove the condemnation in the conscience; it does not cleanse our heart. It does not make our heart clean or rid it of sins. The Lord's blood is objective; it is not subjective. It does not cleanse our heart; it only cleanses our conscience.</P><P>All men are corrupt. With the Lord's blood, there is forgiveness of sin and no more punishment. But the Bible does not tell us that the blood can remove the power of sin. That is another matter altogether. On the one hand, the Bible tells us of the Lord's blood. On the other hand, the Bible tells us of the Lord's cross. The blood signifies death, and the cross also signifies death. The blood relates to punishment; it deals with our sins before God. The cross deals with the power of sin within us. The cross cleanses our heart and enables us to overcome sin.</P><P>Now we have to consider the difference between the cross and the blood. The Lord's blood removes the sins before God, while the cross deals with the sin within man. Please remember that the cross does not crucify the inward sin. We have to understand this. Many people who preach the doctrine of sanctification are wrong in this matter. The Lord's cross has not crucified sin. We cannot find one verse in the Bible that says that the cross has crucified sin. Who can find a verse that says that the cross has crucified the sin within us or outside of us? No one can find a verse on that point. Then what has the cross crucified? The Lord was crucified there. Some have said sin was also crucified there. But who has said this? The Bible tells us that the old man has been crucified, not sin. Powerful sin was not crucified but the old man who loves to be directed by sin was crucified. The root of sin-the sin that acts as the root-was not eradicated, but the old man-the one which cleaves to the root of sin-was crucified by the Lord on the cross. I will tell you a gospel word today. When the Lord was crucified, He was not crucified there alone. We, who are corrupted beyond measure, who sin, and who are defiled, were also crucified with Him on the same cross! We have been crucified with Him!</P><P>Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." Please remember that it says that our old man is crucified with the Lord. It does not say that sin is crucified with Him. Brothers and sisters, have others told you that sin can be crucified on the cross, and that the root of sin can be eradicated? There is not such a thing.</P><P>In this verse in Romans, we can see three things: (1) the old man, (2) the body of sin-the body that commits all the sins, and (3) sin. This verse tells us three very important things: (1) that our old man has been crucified with Him on the cross, (2) that the goal is to annul the body of sin, and (3) that the result is to cause us, our person, to become no longer a slave to sin. When the old man is crucified, we can no longer sin and will no longer sin. However, sin itself has not died; it is still living.</P><P>Let me illustrate these three things-the old man, sin, and the body of sin-by an example. Sin is like the master; the old man is like the steward, while the body is like a puppet. Sin has no power to direct the body of sin or cause it to sin. Sin directs the old man. When the old man agrees, the body becomes a puppet. Therefore, when our old man is alive, it remains in the middle. The body is outside, while sin is inside. Inward sin tempts the old man and stirs up the lusts in the old man. This causes the old man to give an order to the body to sin and practice all kinds of evils. The body is weak; it will do whatever it is told to do. It does not have power over itself; it cannot do anything by itself. It can only act when it is directed by the old man. In delivering us, the Lord does not kill the body or eradicate the root of sin, but crucifies the old man, so that the old man becomes crucified with Him.</P><P>Of the three things in Romans 6:6, only two are left. The body is outside, and sin is inside. In the middle another one, the new man, has been raised up to take the place of the former old man. When inward sin tries to induce the body to sin, it tempts the new man and tries to stir up any lust. However, the new man will not listen to it or yield to its proposals. Formerly, the old man's mind was set on sin; he loved to sin and craved sin. But the new man does not go along with sin; he ignores sin and refuses to answer the demands of sin. Therefore, the body is not able to sin.</P><P>Please read Romans 6:6 again. We have only explained this verse briefly. The verse is clear enough. We know that sin is very evil, and we all hope to remove sin from our body. But we do not realize that the existence of the root of sin, like the existence of the devil himself, has nothing to do with the fruit of sanctification. What is evil and bad is our old man. The reason we can be tempted to exercise our lust or commit outward sins is that our old man is still alive. However, the Lord has crucified our old man with Him.</P><P>What is the purpose of the old man being crucified? The purpose is "in order that the body of sin might be annulled." The word "annulled" may be translated as unemployed. This means that without the old man, the body of sin cannot do anything. Formerly, the body of sin followed the direction of the old man in our daily living; sinning was its profession. All it did was sin and nothing else. The old man loved sin very much, it craved sin, and it loved to do all the sinful things. This is why the body followed it to sin, making it the body of sin. Now the old man has been dealt with by the Lord; it has been crucified. Therefore, the body of sin has become unemployed; it has lost its job. When the old man was alive, the body of sin practiced sin as its profession and job. Although sin still remains and still wants to be the master, we are no longer its slave. Although sin tries again and again to stir up the body to practice sin, the new man, through the reigning of the Holy Spirit, will not permit this to happen. As a result, sin cannot cause the body to sin. Therefore, the Bible tells us that the result of the crucifixion of the old man and the unemployment of the body of sin is "that we should no longer serve sin as slaves!"</P><P>The old man is dead. This is why we can overcome sin completely. The Lord's blood was shed and has delivered us from our sins before God and stopped our conscience from condemning us. By the blood, we know that we will no longer perish, we have peace, we are reconciled to God, and we have rest. But if we only know this aspect of salvation, we are still living a suffering life. We may know that sin is forgiven, but we may still practice sin as our profession; we may not have any victory over sin practically and may not be bearing the fruit of sanctification. We may still be forced to sin every day. We will find that we still do not have peace, and our fellowship with God is cut off. Although we know that we are saved and have eternal life, our daily sins have robbed us of the joy of salvation. Thank God that the Lord's salvation is not a halfway salvation. The Lord shed His blood to cleanse us from our sins, and His cross has removed our old man and delivered us from the power of sin.</P><P>Please remember that a believer does not die by killing himself or by committing suicide. Some have preached that Christians ought to put themselves to death so that they will no longer sin. This is wrong. We were crucified on the cross when the Lord Jesus was crucified there. Let me ask: have we died? Thank the Lord that the old man, who is so hard to deal with and dies with so much difficulty, has been crucified on the cross by the Lord! Thank and praise Him! Hallelujah!</P><P>Do we realize that we are evil beyond measure? I know that I am most evil and detestable. Many times when I was under the oppression of the power of sin, I wished that I could have died. But unfortunately, I could not make myself die. Later, I saw that when the Lord was crucified on the cross, my old man was crucified with Him, so that my sinning body no longer would be a slave to sin. How happy I was! Because of the Lord's work, sin is now under my feet; it has no more power over me. Thank and praise the Lord!</P><P>Our sin cannot be removed by prayer, Scripture reading, godliness, worship, asceticism, or sufferings. We are delivered from sin by the Lord crucifying our old man with Him on the cross. Remember that the blood deals with the sins before God, while the cross deals with the old man.</P><P>What then should be our attitude towards sin? Read Romans 6:11: "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus." Some have changed this verse to read, "Consider yourselves to be dead to sin," thinking that by just considering, sin would die. But there is no such thing. Some have said that the root of sin can be eradicated. Others have said that we can consider sin to be dead. But I must tell you that it is not a matter of considering sin to be dead, but a matter of reckoning ourselves as having been crucified.</P><P>The Lord has crucified our old man on the cross; the body of sin has been annulled, and we should not be a slave to sin any longer. But many people do not understand why their experience does not match these facts at all. They are still sinning and not able to come out of sin's domination. The body is still busily motivated by sin. Why is this the case? The reason is that while the Lord has accomplished a full salvation for us, we have not accepted His work and believed in what He has accomplished. We have not applied His victory by faith. He has crucified our old man, but we do not believe that our old man has been crucified in a definite way. We still consider our old man to be alive. This is the reason that after we are told the fact in Romans 6:6, verse 11 tells us what we should do. Romans 6:6 tells us that our old man has been crucified. Verse 11 tells us that since the Lord has crucified the old man, we should reckon it as dead so that it no longer can make us sin. We can therefore say to sin, "Our old man is dead, and I am no longer your slave." If we want to wait to find out if sin is dead and the lusts are gone, we will never find them dead. Sin is more alert than we are; it is more alive than we are. As soon as an opportunity comes, it will seize us. It will not die. But this is all right because our old man has died. We cannot overcome sin. The way is not to consider sin as being dead, but to believe in the accomplished work of the Lord, which is to reckon our old man dead.</P><P>Romans 6:11 says that we should reckon. How does one reckon? Two plus two is four. Why do you reckon that it is four? It is because two plus two is indeed four. Therefore, the meaning of reckoning ourselves dead is not that we are not dead but we try temporarily to consider ourselves dead, deem ourselves dead, and think that we are dead. It is not to say to ourselves that the old man is gone. The death of the old man is something that God has accomplished. This is why we can reckon it as being true. Reckoning means that God has counted us crucified; the fact is reckoned on God's side, and we reckon ourselves dead as a consequence. We reckon two plus two to be four because two plus two is four and not three or five. God said that we are crucified. We believe this and acknowledge that we are dead. To believe is to say that since God has declared our sins forgiven, we also declare our own sins forgiven. God says that we are dead, and we acknowledge ourselves as being dead. Christians must stand daily on the ground of Romans 6 before we can overcome all sins. I am not boasting, but I can say that no sin is too hard to overcome because the Lord has crucified our old man on the cross. This is why we can overcome all sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BURIAL</H2><P>Now let us come back to our main subject. Why do we have to be baptized? On the one hand, it is because our sins are washed away. On the other hand, it is because we have died. We should be baptized because our sins are washed. Baptism testifies to the fact that our sins are washed. We should be baptized also because our old man is dead. Baptism testifies to the fact that our old man is indeed dead. What is the first thing that we should do to a man who is dead? Will anyone try to leave a dead man on display for more than a few days? After a few days, the body begins to stink, and worms attack the skin. Last year a sister died. We loved her very much, but there was no way that we could keep her for more than a few days. Once a man dies, there is no use for him anymore and the first thing to do is to bury him. The act of burial is a testimony that the one who is being buried is dead. Suppose there is someone whom we love dearly, as dearly as we love ourselves. She is dying of an illness, but there is still a pulse and still a little breath within her. While she lies there motionless and speechless, would we put her into the coffin? We would surely not do this because we do not believe that she is dead. When do we bury our dear father, mother, wife, or friends? We bury them when we know for sure that they are dead and they can live no longer. As long as there is a little hope of life, we would never bury our dear father, mother, wife, or friends. When they have died and the situation becomes hopeless, we bury them. We cannot bury a person before he is dead; nevertheless, the first thing we do to a dead person is to bury him.</P><P>The Bible tells us that since we are crucified, we are buried with the Lord. The meaning of baptism in the Bible is not just a washing but a burial. This is why we must be baptized. This means that we believe we are dead persons. This is why we ask others to bury us in the water. We do this because we believe that we are dead and that we will not change. If a man does not believe that he is dead, he cannot be baptized because to do so would be to bury someone who is alive. It is wrong to bury a living person. Those who are baptized must believe that they have been crucified with Christ. How do we show that we have believed? How do we testify to the accomplished work of Christ? We testify through baptism. When we are buried in water through baptism, it shows that we believe that the Lord's blood has cleansed us from our sins and that His cross has crucified our old man with Him. We are baptized because we believe in these facts; baptism proves that we are already cleansed and already dead.</P><P>Therefore, there are two conditions for baptism. The Bible tells us to rise and wash away our sins. This means that we believe God has redeemed us from sin and has washed us, so we testify to this by means of baptism. The Bible also tells us to rise up and be buried in the water by baptism through believing that we are dead. Not only are our sins washed away, but our person is buried. Sins are washed away, and the person is also washed away. This is the meaning of baptism. This is the testimony of baptism.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>Friends, can you give such a testimony? I do not have to exhort you to be baptized. Those among us who have not believed in the Lord Jesus do not have their sins forgiven, and I hope that you would believe right away. If you have believed and do not know that you can overcome your sins fully because you are still losing your temper, sinning, and committing evil, you should realize that the Lord has crucified you with Him on the cross. Now nothing should cause you to sin. You can overcome all sins. Please exercise your faith to stand on the ground of Romans 6, believing that you are dead. What can sin do to you? A believer must stand on the ground of Romans 6:6 and 11 before he can overcome sin. Otherwise, he can piously pray and read the Bible, but it will not avail anything. He must first reckon that he is dead before these other things can be added to him in a useful way.</P><P>If anyone sitting here has believed that the Lord's blood has cleansed him from his sins and that He has crucified our old man with Him on the cross, he should rise up and be baptized and hand himself over to the burial.</P><P>Here I would say a word in passing. The proper baptism is to be immersed. No other baptism can be considered a baptism. Please consider one thing. If I remember correctly, the first instance of burial in the Old Testament is in Genesis 23:8: "And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me." What is the meaning of burial? It is removing the dead out of one's sight; it is causing the eyes not to see the dead one. If you are not immersed in water, it cannot be considered a burial. Being buried is not seeing the old man any longer.</P><P>Today I am not telling you what is a baptism and what is not a baptism. I am telling you the two meanings of baptism. The first meaning is the washing away of sins, and the second is the reckoning of our old man as crucified and buried. May we all be able to testify that the Lord has delivered us from sin and that not only are our sins forgiven, but that we ourselves are dead. May we not only be able to testify this with our mouth but in our daily walk as well. May we all believe in the accomplished work of the Lord so that we can receive the peace and joy of forgiveness and be liberated, freed, and overcoming persons. Amen!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRODIGAL SON</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 15:11-32</H1><P>I have spoken on this passage three times already. Today I will not speak much about it again. I am not going to cover the whole parable but only point out a few things. I will speak a little here and a little there in a fragmentary way.</P><P>Verses 17 through 19 say, "But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine! I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants." Whenever a sinner becomes repentant through the operation of his environment, he has a certain evaluation concerning his own salvation. If a man does not want to be saved, he will not have any consideration concerning his salvation; he will not care about the matter or be bothered about it. But once he is awakened, he will begin to consider how he can be saved and what are the conditions for one to be saved. If you ask any sinner about the way of salvation, you will find out that he has his own idea of being saved. God has His way of salvation, and a sinner has his way of salvation. I am afraid that with a hundred sinners, there are a hundred different ways of salvation. Everyone has his concept, and everyone has his evaluation. The prodigal son had his way of salvation. He thought that when he saw his father, his father would rebuke him with a stern face, and so he would answer, "The inheritance that you gave me has been spent. I cannot use another penny of yours anymore. But you are a rich man and have many hired servants. Just hire me as you have hired one of your servants." For him, salvation was not to be a son but a slave only!</P><P>A sinner's way of salvation is by giving others what they deserve and receiving back what they deserve. It is by working for others and receiving wages from them. The amount of work one does is the amount of wages one receives. It is by being a slave and not a son.</P><P>Verses 20 through 22 say, "And he rose up and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet." The prodigal son rose up to come to his father. When he saw the father, he repeated the speech he had planned. He said that he was not worthy to be called his son and was going to say more, "but the father said to his slaves." Hallelujah! "But the father." Salvation is according to God's concept and not according to our concept. No one in the world is saved according to what he thinks but according to what God thinks. The prodigal son's concept was to only be a hired servant. Our thoughts are filled with the law, which is always a question of doing something and receiving something back in return.</P><P>The prodigal son had prepared a speech for his father. But when he saw the father and was touched by his love, the prepared sentence, "Make me like one of your hired servants," did not come out. If we read the whole passage carefully, we will see that he did not say these words because he was interrupted by his father and had no chance; it was not because he did not want to continue speaking. His father had heard enough and did not want to wait for him to finish his words. "But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."</P><P>Salvation tells us how God wants to treat us, not how we think that God should treat us. According to our concept, we will always be a hired servant. When we remember the Lord, we think of ourselves as sinners, but God considers us as sons. We think that we deserve to perish, but He puts us at the feasting table. We cannot speak enough of God's grace. Even as we repeat it again and again, we are not afraid that it will occupy too much of our mind. We may think that we are not worthy to be called sons, but He has done more than we can imagine. Thank the Lord that salvation is not according to our thoughts or our concepts but according to God's thought.</P><P>While the prodigal was still a long way off, the father saw him and was moved with compassion. The Samaritan saw the man who fell among the robbers on his way to Jericho and was moved with compassion (Luke 10:30-35). What is compassion? Only after a person has fallen into a low estate can compassion be exercised. Compassion is directed downward from above; it is applied in mercy towards someone. If the son had come back in a grand manner, there would have been no way that the father could have shown compassion toward him. How was compassion exercised? When the father saw that the son had degraded into the position of a beggar and actually was a beggar, compassion was exercised. Only a beggar can become a son. Only a beggar standing by the door can sit at the feasting table. Only a beggar far from God can draw nigh to Him. When our condition becomes that of a beggar, God's compassion is moved.</P><P>We should see that the son thought he was not worthy to be called a son; he thought that he would only be a hired servant. But the father told the slaves to bring the best robe out quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. This shows us that salvation demonstrates God's riches and not our poverty. There are some preachers who have been preaching for many years, who still do not understand salvation. Salvation tells us how rich God is. Many times, we think that we are not worthy. When we are somewhat awakened, we are not sure if God will forgive us when we call on Him. It seems as if someone like us has no ground to call on Him at all. But I have to say that our eyes are set on the wrong thing. A rich man has untold riches; he does not think about how much his son has spent but about how much he can give to his son for him to spend.</P><P>Let me give an illustration here; it may not be the most appropriate illustration. Once I met a rich man's son. I tried my best to persuade him to repent and believe in the Lord. One day he took me to his father. I told the father not to stop the son from believing in the Lord, and that if the son believed in the Lord, he would not spend his father's money carelessly anymore. But he said, "What I have is money. I am not afraid of his spending my money." He was not concerned about his son spending too much of his money. In the same way, our God is not concerned that we would spend too much. We think that God has only one hundred dollars and that we need one hundred and one dollars. We are always afraid that after we have spent everything, nothing will be left. But what our Father has is "money"; do not try to limit God. We should realize that salvation tells us how rich God is; it tells us that God has enough for us to spend again and again.</P><P>Some may think, "I am not able to overcome a certain sin. I have exhausted all means." But can we say to God that He cannot do anything regarding our particular sin? Many times we do not behave well as a Christian; we become weak and sinful, and our conscience tells us that our condition is hopeless. But the conscience only tells us our condition, while the blood tells us the way that God deals with our condition. The conscience tells us how we are in ourselves, but the blood tells us how God deals with us. Our conscience has been sprinkled by the blood. We have not only the conscience and the blood in the basin, we have the blood sprinkled in our conscience. The blood is not separated from the conscience, and the conscience is not separated from the blood. Rather, we have a conscience sprinkled with the blood, a conscience which is whiter than snow and cannot be made whiter than it already is.</P><P>God also has a robe for us, and He is not afraid that we will sell it. He has a ring for us, and He is not afraid that we will pawn it. He has sandals for us, and He is not afraid that we will wear them out. God's children ought to be adorned well and appear attractive. God has enough for those of His household to spend.</P><P>Verse 23 says, "And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry." The robe, ring, and sandals in the previous verse are for the son alone to enjoy because a robe can only be upon one person, a ring can only be upon one hand, and a pair of sandals can only be upon one pair of feet. However, a fattened calf cannot be consumed by one person alone; rather, "let us eat and be merry." Let me give a new thought today, God can be merry! On the night I was saved, I was so happy. The more I considered, the happier I became, and the happier I became, the more I sang. Although I did not have a tune or a song, I could not care less. This is the joy of a sinner concerning his salvation. But this verse tells us that God can be merry also. It is the joy of God's salvation of man! When a sinner is saved, we think how happy he is. But we have not seen how happy God is when He saves a sinner. When we see this, we will understand God's heart.</P><P>Verse 29 says, "But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends." This was the word of the older son to the father. The heart of the older son was on the father's happy giving to the younger son. The younger son had spent all, yet the father was happy. The older son had fulfilled his duty in the father's house. His mistake was that he only wanted his father to make him happy. The father wanted the older son to go and join the merriment. Our God wants us to be merry with Him. We have to take care of His heart. The older son wanted a goat for his own merriment. But in everything that God does, He never gives anything to man to enjoy by himself; He always gives something with the intention that man would enjoy it together with Him.</P><P>Let us compare two things, the kissing and the feasting. The father fell on the neck of the son and kissed him affectionately. Such kissing caused the son to be happy and satisfied. When the son was kissed this way, he knew that his father had forgiven him and would no longer remember his sin. He received the freedom of forgiveness and was satisfied. At the same time, while the son was sitting at the feast, the father's heart was happy and satisfied because he had gained his son back. Many people do not realize that when a man is saved, God is happy. They think that God has saved them because of their strong pleading. They do not realize that God is happy to save. In saving men, God receives the joy.</P><P>When we hear the Father telling us that our sins are forgiven, we have peace and joy. If we have not yet received the freedom of forgiveness, we are indeed poor men. All who are sitting here today have heard that their sins are forgiven; they have peace and do not need to ask anyone or look for any other evidence. As long as God has said it, it is enough. When He says that we are forgiven, we are forgiven. Unfortunately, we only enjoy half of the happiness; we have not yet entered into God's happiness, enjoyed His happiness, and allowed Him to enjoy His happiness over us. Real worship is having the happiness which God has. Some have said it well, that worship is not just to thank Him but to consider Him as one's joy. We joy in God. There is a phrase in Psalms which says that God is our exaltation's rejoicing (Psa. 43:4). We should all consider God as our exaltation's rejoicing.</P><P>Verse 24 says, "Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found. And they began to be merry." God says that we should be merry. What are the reasons for being merry? There are two reasons. The first is that the son was dead and now lives. The second is that the son was lost and now is found. This is why we should be merry. Being dead and living again is the son's gaining something. Being lost and being found again is the father's gaining something. The prodigal son was originally a son; now he becomes a son once again. Man was first created by God, but later he fell and was as good as dead. When the Lord Jesus came to save men, He caused dead men to become alive again. This is to be dead and live again. This is not the part we emphasize today. What we will pay attention to today is to be lost and found again.</P><P>There are three parables in Luke 15. They are the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son. Have you ever thought about this? With these three losses, who do you think is the one that lost them? We think that the lost sheep was poor, who was probably fumbling in the barren hills and the scattered rocks, and who had probably fallen into the thorny paths. We forget that the one who lost the sheep was the shepherd. The one who suffered was the shepherd. The one who was poor was the shepherd. We wonder where the lost coin was, but we forget that it was the woman who had lost the coin and it was she who suffered. In the last parable we always think about the poor prodigal son, who wandered in destitution and longed to be satisfied with carob pods when no one would give him anything. When we consider how he turned, we rejoice for the great blessing he received. But who was the one who had lost the son? It was not the son but the father. The poor one was the father; the suffering one was the father. It was the father who had sacrificed his heart and wasted his money on his son's education. This is why the father said that his son was lost and now was found, and why they began to be merry. Have we ever thought that when we turn back and obey, God's heart will rejoice? The highest point of the gospel is not to show us what the sinner has received but what God has obtained. We have squandered the money, but God has suffered. We should give ourselves totally to God. How much have we given to God? Do not think that it is all right to be a little cold. We have to realize how much God suffers by our little coldness. Do not think that it is all right to love the world a little and be mixed with it a little. We have to realize how much this affects God. This will cause God to suffer. Every time we come before God, consecrate ourselves to Him once again, and deny ourselves once again, God gains something, and we are giving joy to God.</P><P>Our personal, petty gains and losses are worth nothing. What counts is for God to gain something. It is a wonderful thought that every time we choose the way of submission to God, we make His heart happy and gain something for Him. God can create the universe, and He can give things to men. But it is possible for Him to lose the heart of men! God cannot force man's heart to go His way! What a joy to consider that a God as great as ours, who is omnipotent, who has everything, and who is the Creator of everything, would want something from those who are like worms and dust! He said, "We had to be merry and rejoice" (v. 32). The return of a prodigal son can cause God to rejoice. The God who holds the universe will rejoice at a little obedience from us. Consecration is not an imposition or concession but a way for us to enter into the joy of God; it makes God happy on account of us. How amazing this is! May we all enter into the joy of God today, and may we all render Him the joy.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REASON THE LORD<br>WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 21</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:13-14; 2:23-24; 6:15; 7:3-4, 6, 9; 12:24; 13:37-38; 16:31-33</H1><P>Our Lord did everything well when He was on earth.

This is the Lord's own promise to us: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." Whoever drinks of the water that the Lord gives will be quenched of his desires forever; he will never feel that he is lacking in something and will never be disappointed. Our next question is, can this be possible? Yes, it is possible that those who have received the Lord Jesus will never thirst again. But why are some people still not satisfied? Some have said that they are still thirsty, that they still have not received what they want, and that there is still something they are after. Does this mean that the Lord's promise is not fulfilled? No, it does not because the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water He gives will by no means thirst forever. The Lord satisfies forever.</P><P>Why then are we still thirsty? Why then are we not satisfied and still filled with desires? Why are there still sorrows, worries, demands, and self-pity? The reason is that we only see the promise of verse 14 but have forgotten the declaration of verse 13. The Lord not only says, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever," He also says before this that "everyone who drinks of this water [the world's water, the water left by Jacob, which is the best water in the world] shall thirst again."</P><P>Many people do not understand the nature of the water of this world. They do not understand the nature of the things that the world can give to them, whether they last, and how long they last. They cannot tell, first of all, the difference between the temporary and the eternal, the seen and the unseen, the physical and the spiritual. This is why they do not understand that to have the promise of the Lord in verse 14, in which He promises to satisfy their hearts, there must first be the realization of verse 13 which says that the water of this world cannot satisfy their hearts. We must first know that "everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" before we understand the Lord's word, "by no means thirst forever." The Lord wants us to be satisfied; He does not want us to take one thing and hope for another over and over again and never find ourselves satisfied.</P><P>Today I am not speaking about the world's water and how it cannot satisfy man's heart. I am here to explain why Christians feel thirsty in this world. Why are Christians thirsty? The reason we are thirsty is because we turn back to drink the water of verse 13. Why do we become disappointed? If there is no hope, there will be no disappointment. If there was never a hope, there would never be a disappointment. If we never hope to have money, we will never be disappointed by the lack of money. In the same way, if we hope that the water of this world can satisfy us, our eyes will be turned in the wrong direction, and we will feel thirsty. This is the reason we become heartbroken, uneasy, and disappointed. Why is it that we cannot be satisfied? We want to satisfy our desires with the things that are soon passing away. If we want transient things, transient fame and fortune, we will never be satisfied. Once these things fall into our hands, we will find that they do not gratify us; they will not make us happy or satisfied. We feel that we have more desires; we want more things. We are thirsty again and have to drink again. Our mistake lies in the fact that we try to satisfy ourselves with transient things. If our hands are holding onto these transient things and our hearts are set on these transient things, we will never be satisfied in our hearts.</P><P>Today I will speak about the Lord's own words exclusively from the Gospel of John. In addition to the Gospel of John, the other three Gospels record many of the Lord's words. Our Lord was never discouraged. What He experienced and encountered in His environment during His lifetime should have given Him much discouragement and disappointment. But He was not discouraged or disappointed. Isaiah 49 says something concerning the Lord. It says that God intends for Christ to bring Jacob back again to Him and gather Israel back again to Himself. But outwardly everything seemed to have failed completely. How did He feel? It says, "I have labored in vain; / I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity; / Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, / And my recompense with my God" (v. 4). He was not disappointed. Isaiah 42 also says that the Lord did not faint and was not discouraged. Although what He encountered could have caused Him to faint and be discouraged, He did not behave that way.</P><P>The emphasis of the Gospel of John is different from that of the Gospel of Matthew. The Lord in the Gospel of John was rejected by men from the beginning. The Lord in the Gospel of Matthew was not rejected until after chapter twelve. John 1 records that the Lord came to His own, and His own received Him not. He came to bear the sins of the people of Israel and the Gentiles. Yet men did not want Him; they rejected Him and would not receive Him. When He was on the cross, men rejected Him, and God also rejected Him. We would have been disappointed, discouraged, saddened, and grieved. But John 19 records that the Lord cried on the cross, "It is finished!" We would have cried, "It is over!" But He was shouting like a victorious army, "It is finished!" Throughout His life, He took satisfaction in God. He had no hope toward the world and did not expect to receive anything from it. His only hope was in God, and His only satisfaction was in God. He said that no one knows the Son except the Father, that He did not receive glory from men, that He did not come to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him, and that He always did the will of the One who sent Him. Our Lord had God's will as His satisfaction all His life. He was satisfied only with God. This is why He was not disappointed no matter how people, events, and things in this world changed. Those who take their satisfaction in God will never be disappointed.</P><P>On the negative side, we should not cherish any hope concerning the world. If we do not expect any fame, glory, help, comfort, or support from this world, we will never be thirsty. We should take care of the way we view the water of this world. Our view concerning the world will surely determine our hope towards those in the world.</P><P>"Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men" (John 2:23-24).</P><P>In John 2 the Lord performed two great miracles. After He performed the first miracle, the disciples believed in Him. After He performed the second miracle, many who saw His miracles also believed in Him (v. 23). When we see the congregation growing and the number of believers increasing through our preaching, our hearts subconsciously go to the work. But the Lord was not this way. Verse 24 says, "But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men." He would not take any enjoyment from men. He did not entrust Himself to men because He knew that they would eventually be the ones to crucify Him on the cross. The Lord was glad when so many believed in Him. But He would not entrust Himself to them. He would not allow them to gain His heart. The work might be successful, but it did not occupy His heart. This is why He could maintain His transcendency.</P><P>"I do not receive glory from men" (John 5:41). In this chapter there was a man who was ill for thirty-eight years. He was healed by the Lord in an instant. After this, many who had opposed Him no longer opposed Him. Many were giving glory to God. But the Lord Jesus said, "I do not receive glory from men." The Lord said that He would not receive glory from men. We would have gladly welcomed glory from men. If we expect glory from men, we will rejoice when men give us glory and will be disappointed when they do not give us glory. But the Lord would not accept any glory from men on the negative side. He would not accept anything. He did not expect anything and would not accept anything. As a result, He was not disappointed in anything.</P><P>"Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone" (John 6:15). At that time, there were a few thousand people gathering there. They saw the miracle of the multiplying of the loaves and exclaimed that this man was indeed their king. Although many people exalted the Lord, He rejected them all. He would not receive glory from men. He would not take anything from men and drink of the water of this world. The God within Him was enough to satisfy His heart. This was why He could reject everything that the world would give Him. To "withdraw" is the best attitude. Withdrawing will preserve a worker of the Lord from the damage of being uplifted. Withdrawing gives a person the opportunity to prove that God is the satisfaction; it is also the result of being satisfied in God.</P><P>"His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing; for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world...Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready...And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee" (John 7:3-4, 6, 9). At that time, the brothers of the Lord thought that He could become famous by performing more miracles. Therefore, they said to the Lord, "If You want a name, You should go to places with many people. If Your disciples had not seen You, they would not have believed in You, and if the Jews do not see You, they will not believe in You either. Jerusalem is a big place and has many people. If You go there, men will believe in You, and You will be famous." Yet the Lord "remained in Galilee." Although it was an easy thing to move to another place, and although such a move would have given Him many conveniences, He would not do it. Most people are curious and many will utter praises out of curiosity. If the Lord had accommodated them, there would have been hundreds of opportunities for Him to receive praise. But the Lord did not entrust Himself to them. He did not want special praises from men. He had something within Him and had no need of any outward thing. He knew the nature of the water of this world. This is why He could say to the few women who wept for Him when He was crucified on the cross, "Do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children" (Luke 23:28). He was not disappointed.</P><P>"Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). In this chapter, we see the most glorious day the Lord had on earth. Not only did many Jews believe in Him, and not only did His friends believe in Him, even the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him" (John 12:19). Not only did His enemies concede their defeat, His friends trust in Him, and the Jews believe in Him, but the Gentiles also believed in Him. At that time, a few Greeks asked Philip to tell the Lord Jesus that they wanted to see Him. These groups of people all confessed that this was the day of victory for the Lord Jesus. If we were in such a situation, we would have been riding on the clouds and basking in our own glory. But what did the Lord Jesus do? At that very instant, He told His disciples, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." The Lord said this with reference to His own death (see 12:33). It seems as if the Lord was saying to Philip, "The way the Father has commissioned me to take is not always one that rides into Jerusalem on a donkey. It is not always a way that men welcome." The world was willing to give everything to Him, but He did not enjoy it and would not accept it. He did not drink any of the water of this world. He rejected everything from man and set His eyes on what God gave to Him.</P><P>We should learn this lesson. In particular, the workers of the Lord should learn this lesson. Although men may turn their face towards us today, they may kick their heels at us tomorrow. The ones who cried, "Hosanna," to the Lord one day were the same ones who cried, "Take Him away," the next day. The Lord was not discouraged or disappointed by them. He rejected in a hidden way all the excellent treatment from men. He would never have any direct relationship with His environment. His direct concern was God and His will. This is why His way in the world was not crooked. But our way in the world is crooked. Our Lord did not allow His friends to make His way crooked; He did not allow men's praise to influence His pathway, nor did He allow the enemy's opposition to change His journey.</P><P>"Peter said to Him, Lord, why can't I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You. Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times" (John 13:37-38). All the temptations mentioned above were either from men's glory or the enemy's suggestions. This was a harder temptation for the Lord from Peter. Peter said, "Why can't I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You." The Lord replied to Him saying, "A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times." To our impression, Peter often went before the Lord to help Him. But the Lord would not entrust Himself to him. If I had a disciple-of course, I do not have any-and if he was always helping me at my side, I am afraid I would give him a fierce look if he denied me in the middle of my trial in court. The look would say, in effect, "Why do you deny me?" But the Lord turned and looked at Peter (Luke 22:61). That one look caused Peter to go out and cry. One of the our hymns says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>What has stripped the seeming beauty<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the idols of the earth?<br>Not a sense of right or duty,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sight of peerless worth.</P><P CLASS=HBODY> 'Tis that look that melted Peter,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis that face that Stephen saw,<br>'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can alone from idols draw.</P><P>Once He takes a look at us with His two eyes, we melt.</P><P>But there is another revelation in His looking at Peter. We have put too much hope in "our Peter." When he says some untrustworthy words, offends us, or talks about us, we become disappointed, discouraged, and even grieved. We cannot stand our Peter's misunderstanding and unfaithfulness. But if we drink of the water of this world, hoping that our friends, relatives, or others will satisfy us, we will surely be thirsty again. If we are happy about our house, friends, food, and all the other things because they are from God, we can be satisfied with God and will not be disappointed when our situation changes. We will not be stumbled or hurt.</P><P>"Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world" (John 16:31-33). At that time, the disciples had all believed in the Lord Jesus. The Lord asked, "Do you now believe?" He also said, "You will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me." John 17 is the last prayer of the Lord, while John 16 is His last discourse with the disciples. The consummation of His discourse is in the last few sentences of chapter sixteen. He said that everyone would be scattered and that He would be left alone. We would have complained to God if we had been left alone, but the Lord said that the Father was with Him. He could try to draw comfort from all the disciples who had been with Him for years, but He did not put His hope in any one of them. Although they all left Him, He did not feel hurt or unsettled. On the contrary, He told them His experience so that they would have peace in Him. He knew that those who drink of the water of this world will be thirsty again, and He would not drink it even when there was water readily available to Him. Those who do not drink of this water but drink of the living water will never thirst again.</P><P>Why can we not live a satisfied life? Why are we disappointed? It is because we have hopes. In fact, we have great hopes. But when we cannot get what we hope for and cannot be satisfied, we become disappointed. I can testify that many times I was ridiculed, but many times I was praised also. Sometimes even Satan would praise me. At such times the Lord would remind me of this verse, and I was reminded to drink less of this water. In this way I would not become thirsty after a while and be disappointed again. When human love, help, money, fame, ease, and comfort come our way, we may think that they are ours and that we may drink as much of them as we want. But if we drink so much of them, one day we will become thirsty! The amount we drink in the world will be the degree of thirst we will have.</P><P>Some Christians have asked me why they do not feel the preciousness of the Lord when others feel so much of His preciousness. My answer to them is that they have drunk too many kinds of water besides the Lord. This is why the Lord is not precious to them. We only need to see how much we have consecrated on earth and how much we have forsaken on earth to know how much we treasure the Lord.</P><P>Paul did say that he was for the excellency of Christ. But that was not all he said; he also said that he forsook something. He considered all things as loss. He forsook all things, and at the same time he went after the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. If we have nothing apart from the Lord, we will see that everything in the Lord is precious to us and will satisfy us. According to John 4, the amount we forsake will be the amount we receive. However much we reject the world, we will enjoy that much of the Lord's riches.</P><P>Friends, if others give you love, fame, comfort, glory, and fortune, what will you do? Do you think that the Samaritan woman stopped drinking the world's water just because she had the living water? No, she still had to drink of the world's water. We cannot stop drinking water. This is why when the world, friends, and relatives render us glory, fame, fortune, comfort, and help, we can let them do it. However, we must not indulge ourselves in these things; we must not entrust ourselves to them and should not be moved by them. We should not demand anything from them and should neither drink nor ask to drink. If you do this, you will not be disappointed.</P><P>Isaiah 53:2 is a word concerning the Lord Jesus which I treasure very much: "For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground." What does this mean? In a place where there is water, trees grow easily and quickly. However, the Lord's environment was such that it did not render Him any help at all. His surroundings did not give Him anything. The world did not help Him at all. His enemies did not give Him any help; neither did the devil nor the angels give Him any help. Everything He had was from God; He did not receive anything from His surroundings that would encourage, support, or comfort Him. His life was a straight line. We know that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. Our Lord took the straight path from this world to His destiny. He said that no one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God. What does this mean? Those who have their hands on the plow must look forward; otherwise, the furrows will be crooked. When the eyes look forward, the plow will run straight. If a person looks behind him, the furrow he plows will not be straight. God does not want us to turn or to circle around. He is our satisfaction.</P><P>Why can we be satisfied? We can be satisfied because the water that He will give us will become in us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life. All outward fame and glory, everything outward is useless. Unless Christ is in us, and unless God's Spirit is in us, nothing will satisfy us. Indeed, other than the Lord, nothing can satisfy us. At the same time, if we are not satisfied with Him, we cannot remember Him here.</P><P>I thank Him because He has trodden the way for us. He is indeed our lovable Lord!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S MINISTRY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting)<br>Issue No. 22</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 10:45; Luke 22:26-27; 12:37</H1><P>The three passages we have just read help us see how Christ served us in the past, still serves us in the present, and is going to serve us in the future.</P><P>Let us consider the first passage: "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45). This verse mentions that the Son of Man came to serve everybody. Whoever comes to the Lord, the Lord always serves them. The Lord feeds the hungry; He heals the sick ones. Without regard to the time and place, the Lord always serves us. The highest service of the Lord was giving His life as a ransom for many. He gave His life to serve man. So many times, we are so eager to serve the Lord that we ignore the fact that our Lord went to the cross and gave His life to serve us. While we were yet sinners, He served us.</P><P>Let us consider the second passage: "But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves" (Luke 22:26-27). The book of Mark concerns Christ serving the sinners. Here it concerns Christ serving His disciples. "I am in your midst as the one who serves." We should remember that the Lord is among us to serve us. This is grace!</P><P>The bread before us at the Lord's table clearly demonstrates how Christ has served us. His body was broken for all of us. The meaning of salvation is that Christ serves us first, and then we serve Him. His serving does not end with the cross. Even now He is among us to continue His service. Whenever we have a need, we ought to come to the Lord and let Him serve us.</P><P>Once, the Lord sent the multitude away and departed to the mountains to pray. The disciples were on the boat, and the wind was against them. They had been straining at the oar until about the fourth watch of the night. It was very dark and the disciples fell asleep. This was the time when we want to sleep the most. At that time the Lord came to help them. The disciples thought that the Lord was a ghost. They were so frightened that they cried out, but immediately the Lord spoke to them, "It is I. Do not be afraid" (Mark 6:45-51). The Lord might have said to them, "It is your Lord," or, "It is the Son of God." Instead, He said, "It is I." What is meant by this? Suppose someone knocks at the door, and the host of the house responds with: "Who is it?" If the knocking one answers, "It is I," we can be assured that the host must be familiar with the one who knocks at the door because the host can distinguish the voice of "I." The Lord came to help the disciples with such a dear and intimate voice. Since this is the case, we should enjoy the Lord's serving us even more!</P><P>The Lord did not have to pay any temple tax. Even if he had to pay, half a stater would have been adequate. But the Lord was so concerned for Peter that He sent Peter to the sea to fish. When the fish was taken up, Peter opened its mouth and found a stater, which was enough to pay Peter's temple tax (Matt. 17:24-27). The Lord served Peter to such an extent that He even prepared the required tax for Peter beforehand.</P><P>When you study the Gospels, do you sense that the Lord served His disciples step by step? You may be amazed and think that Christians ought to serve the Lord and wonder why the Lord would come to serve Christians! Why does the Lord want to serve the Christians? "For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table?" (Luke 22:27). This verse exposes the human concept. The Lord is in our midst as the One who serves. He is able to serve man because He is so great and is even the greatest. The greater we are, the more we can serve. The smaller we are, the less we can serve. Whoever is the smallest may not be able to serve a single person. The Lord is great; He is infinitely great and can therefore serve man in an infinite way.</P><P>The Lord says, "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12). What can serve man better than light? Whoever follows this light no longer walks in darkness but shall receive the light of life. The Lord says, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:48). What can serve man better than bread? Whoever eats this bread shall live forever. Whatever the Lord does is for the purpose of serving. Hallelujah! We have a Lord who serves us. When we face a difficulty or when we do not have any way to work out a problem, it gives the Lord an opportunity to serve us. He is so great that He is able to serve us in everything.</P><P>There is one more thing. The Lord washed His disciples' feet. This was something that Peter would "by no means" allow the Lord to do. But the Lord washed their feet; He served them (John 13:4-8).</P><P>Finally, when men came to arrest the Lord, He asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus the Nazarene." He answered, "I am; if therefore you seek Me, let these go away" (John 18:7-8). The Lord is full of consideration for the disciples. He always served the disciples from the first day He met them to the last day when He left them.</P><P>Once, He said to the Father: "Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost one" (John 18:9). Our Lord always serves us from the first day to the last.</P><P>We still have the third passage: "Blessed are those slaves whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly I tell you that he will gird himself and will have them recline at table, and he will come to them and serve them" (Luke 12:37). This is too gracious! How can this be possible? However, the Lord said He will serve us again in the future. Once we were indebted to the Lord and received His grace freely. We will forever be indebted to the Lord and will forever enjoy His grace.</P><P>I wonder how many people know how to enjoy the service of Christ. Many times we are misled to think that we should serve Christ. Have we ever asked Christ to serve us? Some brothers have said that their prayers are too cold and that they have to do something to stir themselves up again. At such times they should realize that Christ can serve them in that very matter. Some have felt that they have no interest in the Bible and worry about what they should do the next day. They should realize that in that very matter, Christ can serve them also.</P><P>God has given Christ to us for the purpose of serving us. From the day that Christ was crucified on the cross until eternity, Christ will serve us. Although we do not quite understand this, we can enjoy it. We should imitate the disciple John, who reclined on the Lord's bosom and let the Lord do everything for him, rather than Peter, who refused the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>OUR LORD'S SANCTIFYING HIMSELF</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 23</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 17:16-19</H1><P>Today I am going to focus on verse 19, which says that the Lord sanctified Himself for the disciples' sake. The verses we read today are somewhat peculiar. The Lord's desire that His disciples be sanctified required Him to first sanctify Himself for their sake. Why was this so? Many people have a problem when they read these verses. Is He not holy? Is not His nature holy? Why did He have to sanctify Himself? Today I will again speak briefly on the Lord's conduct while He was on the earth.</P><P>Our Lord is holy in His nature. He never knew sin. He is also God and has the power of God. In regard to Himself, He can do many things, and He can do them at will without contradicting His holy nature. In regard to His power, He is able to do many things. He has His independent power and can do things without waiting for God. Yet our Lord never spoke or acted in such a way. In everything, He was under the control of the will of God. He even said, "I can do nothing from Myself" (John 5:30). Why? What does this mean? If the Lord acted according to His own will and power, would His acts have been counted as sin like ours? No, a thousand times no! Why then did He not act according to His own will and by His own power? He was sanctifying Himself for His disciples' sake. When He could have been free, He chose not to be free; when He could have exercised power, He chose not to exercise power, in order to set a good example for His disciples. He is holy, and He could have followed His own will and exercised His own power. But if His disciples followed their own will and exercised their own power that would have been sin.</P><P>The Lord had His freedom and could have done many things. But for the disciples' sake, He was glad to be restricted. In other words, for the sake of the disciples, the Lord gave up His own freedom. He laid aside many of His rights and gave up a great deal of His personal freedom, in order to show His disciples that they should not act freely before God or exercise their own power. If He did not act or exercise freely, should not we do the same? Brothers and sisters, have you ever considered the Lord's life on earth? His entire life on earth was altogether under restriction. He is God, yet He became a man. He could have lived without eating and drinking, yet like all other men He hungered and thirsted. He is God, yet He became a baby. He is absolutely great, yet He grew up according to man's stature. He is such a glorious God, yet He was put into an earthen vessel.</P><P>Our Lord must have labored on earth more than any other person. Once the Lord told the Jews, "Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced." The Jews said, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" (John 8:56-57). O friends, do you know why the Jews spoke such a word? They purposely wanted to reduce the Lord's age by a few years. I truly believe the words in Isaiah 52:14 and 53:2, "His appearance was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men." "He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him. / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him." At that time the Lord was only thirty years old. The Jews purposely wanted to lower His age; yet they said He was close to fifty years old! This shows how old the Lord's countenance appeared. He indeed was a man that had fully experienced the sufferings of human life. You could see this from His face. Let me tell you that this was only a restriction that He faced in His physical body. We do not know the sufferings he experienced due to spiritual restrictions.</P><P>Our Lord is truly holy and without lusts. Although He had the liberty to do many things, He did not do them. He acted in this way for the sake of His disciples. Once a man came to Peter and said, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?" Peter said, "Yes." The Lord did not have to pay the temple tax, but in order not to offend them, He said to Peter, "Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you" (Matt. 17:24-27). Peter should have paid the temple tax; the Lord should not have paid the temple tax. But for Peter's sake, the Lord sanctified Himself. The Lord wanted Peter to know that he should submit to governmental authority; therefore, He paid the temple tax. For Peter's sake, the Lord restricted Himself.</P><P>When the Lord was seized as He came out of the garden of Gethsemane, Peter stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest. What did the Lord say? He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?" (Matt 26:53). But why did the Lord not do this? For the sake of His disciples, the Lord sanctified Himself. The Lord was concerned about what the disciples would do in the future if He beseeched the Father to provide Him with twelve legions of angels. They might, for example, order fire to come down from heaven to consume the Samaritans. The Lord could beseech the Father to provide twelve legions of angels, but His disciples could not order fire to come down from heaven. Therefore, for the sake of His disciples, the Lord did not do this; He sanctified Himself. He was restricted by the disciples.</P><P>Once in the wilderness, there were four thousand people following Jesus, not including women and children, and it was late in the day. What did the Lord say to the disciples? He said, "I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat" (Matt. 15:32). What does "and" indicate? It indicates that the Lord had not eaten for three days either. This is why it says "and they do not have anything to eat." It would have been very legitimate for the Lord to send His disciples to buy food when He had nothing to eat. But He was more concerned about their not having eaten for three days than He was about His not having eaten for three days. If the Lord had cared for His own eating, then at Pentecost there would have been a few more Ananiases and Sapphiras who would have withheld certain portions for themselves. For the sake of His disciples, the Lord sanctified Himself. He was restricted not only in His physical body, but He was restricted also spiritually. How He suffered!</P><P>Likewise, brothers who are more advanced in the Lord and who have learned more lessons, have had more experiences, have a keener conscience, and know God more clearly, will not do many things that they would otherwise have the liberty to do. Although these things are altogether lawful and not sinful, they would not do them for the sake of the younger brothers. For example, many times I have felt this suffering when I stayed with young brothers. One may need more rest because of his physical weakness. Fearing that this may lead others to become lazy, he does not rest as much as necessary. When he loses sleep at night, he should be able to rise up a little later. But for the sake of the weaker brothers who would also rise up late and miss their morning prayer and Scripture reading, he suffers and rises up early. He may have a stomach problem and should be more selective in his eating. But in so doing it may cause the younger ones to be choosy in what they eat. As a result, he does not eat as he should. This kind of sanctifying for the sake of others is very important.</P><P>There was a mother with four sons. All of her four sons loved to drink and they almost exhausted the family's money. One day the mother told a preacher about this matter and he asked her, "Do you drink?" She said, "I always drink a little wine during each meal but never to the extent of getting drunk. My husband also drinks a little." The preacher said, "If you cannot give up your drinking, you should not expect your sons to give up theirs." Indeed, if parents have just a little craving, their children's craving will be many times stronger. If parents smoke cigarettes, the children will smoke opium. If parents watch movies, the children may possibly become movie stars.</P><P>The Lord wants His disciples to be sanctified. For this reason He sanctified Himself. He left a pattern for us to follow. We need to follow His footsteps. He did not need to be restricted, yet He was restricted. For the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself. Do you realize how much the Lord suffered and how much He was restricted when He was living with His disciples? He was tired more than His disciples. He was hungry more than His disciples. He needed rest more than His disciples. Yet He never left them except when He was alone on the mountain praying. He was the same as the disciples in everything. At the very end, His disciples could not point out any flaw in Him. All His disciples testified that He was without sin. Peter said that He was without blemish and spot, that no guile was found in His mouth, and that He committed no sin. Those who lived with Him knew His heart the best, and this was the testimony of one who had lived with Him.</P><P>The Lord is holy. But for the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself. We should also be the same at home, in school, and among the brothers and the sisters. God has put us here in order that we may be a shining light in darkness. We must pass through strippings and bondages. Otherwise, we cannot expect others to be sanctified. We must sanctify ourselves for the sake of others. Today we have seen the Lord and the excellency of His footsteps. Let us follow His footsteps.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A FEW WORDS CONCERNING<br>THE WORK IN SHANGHAI</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Record of Mr. Nee's Speaking after a<br>Bread-breaking Meeting, in Shanghai<br>on the Morning of January 3, 1932)<br>Issue No. 23</H2><P>There is an important announcement today concerning what the brothers and sisters decided in our prayer meeting yesterday afternoon. In the Bible study meeting of the past month, we did our best to study the truth concerning the church. Therefore, our meetings should have a little change. During the past years and days, the affairs in the meetings were the responsibility of only one or two persons. In the beginning, the workers temporarily took up the responsibility of the affairs in the meetings because they were preaching the gospel and speaking the truth here. Now the time has come for the workers to move to the side and for the local brothers and sisters in the meetings to rise up to bear the responsibility.</P><P>According to the teaching of the Bible, the process of establishing a church in every locality is as follows. First, the servants of God, such as the apostles, go out to work. For instance, the apostles went to Ephesus, and they saved some people. The Ephesian believers were the result of their work. After they had worked and some began to meet, they could withdraw. They handed over the management of all the affairs to the elders and deacons of that place. From this we see that the local believers in a place should bear the responsibility of that place. Therefore, we would ask the brothers in Shanghai to rise up to bear the local responsibility.</P><P>On behalf of the brothers and sisters co-working here, I would like to make a small announcement to the brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us here. We have been working here for over four years. Many need to know about the nature of our work, the financial expenditures, and the direction of the workers' work. So, I will speak a little today in order that everyone may understand these things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. A WORKER BEING NOTHING MORE<br>THAN A COMMON BELIEVER</H2><P>Before speaking on the nature of the work, please study what the Bible says concerning this matter. We know that according to the Bible, everyone is equal in the meeting. However, in the aspect of work, there is a distinction between the special workers and the common believers. (Nevertheless, this distinction really should not be considered a distinction.) In human organizations, someone may tell you that there are some who hold offices while others are common believers. Is this scriptural? We have to know that according to the Bible, there is a difference between the workers and common believers in the matter of work. This difference is not due to a difference in their persons; it is due to a difference in their work. However, in the meeting, there is not the slightest distinction between anyone. Whether you are a laborer, a merchant, a student, a physician, or one who does the Lord's work, you are a believer and you are the same as all the other believers. Please remember, when the believers are gathered together, whatever class or kind of people they may be, they are all equal and the same. When you see a worker in the meeting, you may think that he is more special than you, as if he has some authority. But I must tell you that in the meeting, there is no difference between him and you. Now I will speak on the meetings and the work separately.</P><P>The Lord said to the disciples, "The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant" (Matt. 20:25-26). From this we know that there is never a distinction of classes and offices in the meeting. Nevertheless, there is a distinction in the work. The difference between an evangelist and others is not that he is the Lord's worker while the others are only common believers; the only difference lies in the fact that his work is not the same as that of the others. Furthermore, this kind of distinction is very obvious. All are believers, and all are brothers. Yet some brothers are physicians, some brothers are students, some are servants, and some are merchants. In the same way, some are evangelists. An evangelist is no different from other believers than a doctor or a merchant is different from other believers. There is nothing more to this distinction. In the meeting, everyone is equal as brothers. The only difference is that after he is dismissed, everyone has a different work. The work of evangelism is as unrelated to the church as the work of a merchant. Meeting, remembering the Lord, praying, singing hymns, exercising spiritual gifts, teaching the Word, preaching the message of God, and witnessing are things that every brother in the church possesses and bears in common. Just as conducting a business is not an affair of the church, in the same way evangelism is also not an affair of the church. Regardless of which brother, his position and work (according to his gift) is the same in the church. Paul said that everyone could prophesy. But for the work outside of the church, there is a difference between merchants, physicians, students, and evangelists.</P><P>After the meeting is dismissed, everyone begins to do his own work. Some practice medicine, some conduct business, some study, and some preach the gospel. When the time comes for everyone to meet together to worship God, everyone lays down what he ordinarily specializes in and is good at to serve God in one accord and receive edification. There is only the difference between everyone's ordinary work and not a difference between everyone's position during the meeting. This is the teaching of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE WORK AND THE MEETINGS</H2><P>When there is no believer in a locality, God's workers work to lead men to salvation. After some are saved, there is a church in that place. Before the church is fully established, the affairs of the church are temporarily in the hands of the workers. This is according to the Bible. However, having the affairs of a church in the hands of the workers for an extended period of time is something that is not found in the Bible. The workers should not manage a local church. Rather, the workers should manage their own work. When the church is not yet established, they can manage it since it can be considered as their work. Once it is established, however, the responsibility of the church is upon the believers of that locality and no longer on the workers.</P><P>We have previously spoken on the difference between the work and the meetings. In the Bible study meeting last November, we spent two evenings to mention the difference between the work and the church. The work is the responsibility of the workers, while the meetings are the responsibility of all the Christians in that locality. The difference between the work and the meetings is the same as the difference between a shop and the church in your locality. I have to ask you, "Who is the `preacher,' in the meeting at Hardoon Road?" You should answer, "No one." This is like someone asking you who is the physician or tailor in the meetings at Hardoon Road; you would answer, "No one." There is no "pastor" in the meeting; there are only brothers and sisters in the meetings. There is no need of workers as such in the meetings just as there is no need of physicians and tailors as such in the meetings. So, if someone asks you who is the "preacher" in the meeting at Hardoon Road, and if you say, "Mr. Nee," I will be the first one to deny this. If I asked the believers at Ephesus, "Who is your apostle at Ephesus?" they would say, "We do not have our own apostle. However, there was an apostle Paul who once spent three years among us." Was there a local apostle in the church at Ephesus? No. Therefore, we also do not have local preachers. If we were to ask the believers at Ephesus, "Do you have pastors?" they would say, "No. However, at times, there are pastors, apostles, and prophets coming to work in our midst."</P><P>God gives apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers to His universal church. However, the church in a locality does not have apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. These five classes of men are found only in God's work. In God's work there are workers: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. Yet in the local church, there are no such people. In Roman Catholicism there is a distinction between the priests and the common believers. In Christianity there is a distinction between the pastors and the common believers. This is the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which the Lord hates. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are God's workers. In the meetings, at the time of remembering the Lord, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are merely brothers and sisters; they are the same as the rest of the believers. We should not think, "We should not open our mouths to pray and teach in the Lord's Day meeting. It is for the workers to pray and minister the word."</P><P>What kind of relationship is there between the workers and the church? Each worker bears his own responsibility to God's work. The workers can help the church and help the believers; the church can also help their work and help them individually, whether in prayer or in material supply. However, their work is their own responsibility, while the affairs of the meetings are the responsibility of the whole body of believers. This is the difference between the work and the church. Just as we cannot say that a brother is the tailor of our church because he is a tailor, we also cannot say that a worker of God is a worker of our church because this worker of God is in our meetings.</P><P>Is there any relationship between the workers and the church? There certainly is! A worker bears no special relationship with the church as far as his qualifications as a worker are concerned. Yet a worker can help a church based on his qualification as a brother. Furthermore, since the work that a worker does is specifically for God, the whole church should render special cooperation and special help to the work.</P><P>Having said this, to help my co-workers let me mention again the difference between the work and the meetings. We have already seen that there is no distinction of class in the church of God. However, it is different in the work of God. Being in the work is not the same as being in the church where everyone is equal. This is why we see that Timothy, Titus, and Mark worked with Paul; yet at times Paul would send them. In the work of God, we can easily see that Paul bore a little more responsibility than his co-workers. Not only is this true in spiritual work, it is also true in secular work. In a hospital, a shop, or a school, there are those who bear the main responsibilities, and there are those who are the helpers. If everyone bears the same responsibility, there will be great confusion. Nevertheless, we have to say that the work of God as it is currently organized by men, with all of its decorations, elections, and positions, is very different from the biblical practice. According to the Bible, we do not find such things as elections and the titles of "leaders" and "members" even though the ones who are more advanced spiritually will spontaneously bear a little more responsibility.</P><P>Consider Mr. Muller, who was perhaps the greatest man of faith in the last century. Some who knew him told us that when he was in the meetings in Bristol, he would purposely sit on the back row during the meetings because he was afraid that people would think only those of his age and spirituality could open their mouth. He wanted to save some opportunity for the young believers to speak. However, we also know that Mr. Muller managed an orphanage. This was a work he did for God. How did he work? He bore the entire responsibility for it. Whether it was building, buying or selling, or other matters, he was the one who bore the entire responsibility. There were a number of brothers and sisters co-working with him, but they all bore only their share of responsibilities. They worked together, but the responsibilities were not the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN A LOCAL CHURCH</H2><P>Are there then no specific responsible ones and no specific positions in a local church? There are. Please look at the church in Ephesus. They had elders and deacons. Although they did not have Ephesian apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers, they had Ephesian elders and deacons. Every church should have elders and deacons raised up to bear the responsibility of that local church. What do the deacons and elders really do? The deacons only handle the business affairs in the church, while the elders only oversee in a day to day way the condition of the believers' life. During the gathering of the believers, however, the way to speak the word, read the word, sing the hymns, witness, and exercise the spiritual gifts is all according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, as recorded in 1 Corinthians 14. The eldership and deaconry are offices carried out at other times. During the meeting, the matter of the exercise of the gifts is unrelated to the authority of elders and deacons. The responsible ones in a local church are called elders and deacons in the Bible. However, the elders and deacons are not appointed for the meetings. The raising up of a deacon is easy, but the raising up of an elder is difficult. Moreover, we have previously seen that we can have the persons of elders and deacons yet not have the offices of elders and deacons. This point was covered in detail last November while studying the matter of the church. Here we will not repeat it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Few Things of Utmost Concern</H2><P>According to the Bible, the truth on the church is quite clear and we will now summarize the matter as follows:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two Different Things</H2><P>Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are gifts and are given to the whole church; they are given by God and are not restricted to one locality. Elders (overseers) and deacons are offices and are for a local church; these are appointed by men and function within a locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Meetings according to the Bible</H2><P>The elders and deacons attend the meetings solely as brothers. The meetings are not the time for them to exercise their official power. Therefore, one cannot attend the meetings with the qualification of an elder or a deacon. The meeting is the time to exercise the spiritual gifts; whoever has a gift can express God's will according to his gift and by following the leading of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>A worker who serves God full-time can only act in the meetings according to the gift he has. His qualification as a worker gives him no special position in the meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Work and the Meetings</H2><P>In the meetings all the brothers are priests, and all can come before God. There is no distinction of laity and clergy. In the work there are different responsibilities and different positions.</P><P>Although the elders and deacons have their respective office, during the meetings they are the same as the other believers. During the meetings the ones who serve God full-time are the same as the other believers. All business affairs related to the church are the responsibility of the deacons. All the affairs related to the church in general are the responsibility of the elders.</P><P>Regardless of what a person ordinarily does, he can serve others only according to the gift he has received.</P><P>All the believers have to bear the responsibility of witnessing and saving men. However, an evangelist witnesses and saves men as his occupation.</P><P>(The Scriptures upon which this is based were previously covered in the Bible study meeting last November.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE MATTER OF RECEIVING</H2><P>In the past years, there has been a little confusion in our receiving of people for the breaking of bread. The reason for this was inconsistency in our procedure. According to the teaching of the Bible, in our bread-breaking meeting we should receive all those who are saved. Although the Bible tells us about the matter of receiving, we have to decide for ourselves as to how we should receive. This is like the Bible telling us that we should meet but not telling us how to arrange the chairs for our meetings. Although God gives us freedom, we have to be careful not to fall into the trap of so many current man-made organizations. The goal of our work should be to obtain the most effective results through the simplest procedures.</P><P>What should we do if a born-again brother who has been breaking bread at another locality comes to us and desires to break bread with us? He should have a letter of recommendation from the brothers at his locality. This is the teaching of the Bible. There should be at least two believers from that locality to bear witness by writing a letter of recommendation to the church to prove to us what kind of believer he is. For example, if a brother comes from Amoy and wants to break bread with us, he should have a letter of recommendation from two or three brothers in Amoy that tell us about his condition. Regrettably, such procedures are often neglected, and we cannot impose on others to give us such a letter.</P><P>Someone may then be misled to think that those who have not been publicly announced by us cannot break bread with us. This is wrong. An announcement does not have the authority to allow the announced ones to break bread. This is not the teaching of the Bible. Some may say, "Did you not say only those who have been publicly recommended can break bread?" No, it is not true that only those who have been publicly recommended can break bread. Rather, there is the need of two or three brothers or sisters to recommend a person to us by telling us that this brother or sister has really been born again, and that they are now recommending him to break bread with us. Indeed, the most important qualification to break bread is not a matter of announcement or recommendation; it is a matter of whether or not a person has been regenerated. Announcements and recommendations are not the qualification. The qualification is whether or not a person is born again. The only qualification which we insist on is that a person be regenerated. If he is regenerated, we can recommend him to break bread. Therefore, recommendations and announcements do not count. Only regeneration counts.</P><P>Some may ask, "I have been born again. Why do you not allow me to break bread?" Brothers and sisters, you need to know the difference between the Body of Christ and the household of God. The members of the Body of Christ are hidden, while the members of the household of God are different; they are open. The affairs within the household of God need to be witnessed by two or three people. It is not enough for you alone to testify that you are born again, because you are only one person; there is the need for two or three other persons to testify before the matter can be settled.</P><P>Regarding the doctrinal aspect, I do not wish to say any more. We have thoroughly elaborated on it in our Bible study meetings. Regarding the practical aspect, we already made the decision during yesterday afternoon's prayer meeting. If someone wants to break bread with us, we need to announce it in the Lord's Day's morning meeting like this, "Today Brother So-and-so or Sister So-and-so requests to break bread with us. We will ask those brothers and sisters who know him or her to testify whether he or she is born again." At the end of the meeting, some may inform the responsible brothers and sisters. If you know that a person is regenerated and saved, he can be received into the breaking of bread. If you know that a person is a fornicator, a covetous man, an idolater, a reviler, a drunkard, a rapacious man, or if he is unsaved, he cannot break bread with us. Regarding this matter, it is the duty not only of the responsible brothers and sisters but also of every brother and sister.</P><P>If the person who requests to break bread with us does not have a letter of recommendation, and if none among the brothers and sisters in our meetings know about him; then (at least) two of the responsible brothers or sisters should meet with him, fellowship the truth with him, and find out whether or not he is regenerated and whether or not he has accepted the Lord Jesus. Our brothers or sisters will then tell us at the prayer meeting Thursday afternoon whether or not this person is saved and regenerated. If he is saved and regenerated, we can accept him to break bread the following Lord's Day. If this person is not saved and regenerated, we cannot accept him on the Lord's Day. If these two brothers or sisters have doubts and cannot decide, then the person should wait awhile.</P><P>Why are two people needed? Because it is easy for one to be mistaken. In the Bible only the testimonies of two people are counted. Also, if there is only one person, and he is very agreeable, he may hastily assume that this person is saved. If there is a second person, he can check the first one and suggest that this person's salvation is not yet reliably demonstrated and that they should wait a while and decide later. One person's testimony may not be reliable. We need two people to testify together; then we can avoid the danger of having unsaved people being mixed in at the Lord's table. It is not enough to take a person's own word that he is regenerated. We still need to examine this person because sometimes such persons may not really be regenerated.</P><P>The Lord's table is for the Lord's people. Whoever is born again can break bread. Nevertheless, we need to remember that only those who believe in the Lord and are born again can break bread. Whoever does not believe in the Lord and is not born again must not break bread. Therefore, aside from those who are born again, we do not need to ask others to visit our meetings. Nevertheless, if someone wishes to sit in, we naturally cannot refuse him.</P><P>Therefore, I do not think that the Lord wants us to stop people at the door of the meeting hall and ask them if they are born again. This would be confusing and would also create opportunities both for those who are not born again and for those who are born again but have fallen into the six kinds of sins described in 1 Corinthians 5 to sneak into our midst. Since the testimony of one person does not count according to the Bible, the simplest and most effective way is to announce to the congregation one week ahead in the Lord's Day morning meeting that a certain one requests to break bread with us. If there are testimonies from two or three people, we may receive him on the next Lord's Day. If there is no witness who knows him, we may ask two or three brothers to meet with him and talk with him. These two or three brothers will then testify for him in the prayer meeting as to whether or not he is born again. This will decide if we can receive him on the following Lord's Day.</P><P>I have one more word to say. Anyone who is born again will not be impatient, annoyed, and will not become unsaved because of the numerous questions. For example, I am Fukienese; regardless of how many times you question me, I am still Fukienese. I will not become a Shanghainese because of your questions. Therefore, whoever is born again is always born again, because whatever is yes is always yes and will stand the testing. Following our announcement and investigation, we can decide what steps to take at the prayer meeting on Thursday afternoon. After we have made the decision, we can announce in the morning meeting on the next Lord's Day whether or not we have received this person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE SEATING IN THE MEETINGS</H2><P>The meetings in which we break bread to remember the Lord are not times for us to listen to messages. They are actually times for us to praise the Lord and serve Him. The singing of hymns and praying in these meetings should have such as their center. However, there are those who wonder what we are doing and come in to observe us; there are those who bring others in to observe; there are also those who come in by accident. The Bible tells us such situations do exist (cf. 1 Cor. 14:24). Nevertheless, the Bible does not tell us to invite others to come in to observe. Therefore, we can bring in whoever desires to break bread, but there is no need to bring in those who desire to observe.</P><P>In our midst there are two categories of brothers and sisters who do not break bread. One category are those who are born again, yet they do not break bread. They know they should break bread, yet they do not break bread with us. They only come to observe or listen to our sharing of God's messages. The other category are those who are not sure of their salvation. If we ask these ones to sit with us, it would be inconvenient, for such mixed seating will cause great difficulties when we are passing the bread and the cup because we do not know whether the person next to us will eat the bread and drink the cup. If we all have to ask our neighbor whether or not he wants to break bread or whether or not he is saved, the meeting will be disturbed and become very noisy. Therefore, the best way is to separate the seating. Such separation of seating is different from the separation of seating in James 2:1-4 since the seats are not separated to differentiate between high and low ranks and rich and poor but only for the sake of facilitating the process of the meeting. Therefore, we specifically reserve the last rows of seats for the brothers and sisters who do not break bread with us. It does not mean that these two rows of seats are bad seats; in reality, all the seats are the same. The rest of the seats towards the center are for brothers and sisters who break bread. We, therefore, ask the brothers and sisters who want to break bread to sit as much toward the center as possible when they come in.</P><P>Concerning the brothers and sisters visiting from other localities, we ask our brothers and sister to inform them so that they will not misunderstand our differentiation of seats. Concerning the matter of receiving, we are not broad to the point that we receive anyone who comes in. We are only as broad as God is. Whomever God receives, we also receive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE MATTER OF FINANCES IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>Concerning financial matters, we have decided in yesterday's prayer meeting to appoint Brother Chang and Brother Yu to manage the finances in the church. These two brothers also have the same feeling as ours. These two will take up the responsibility to manage the income and expenses of the church. As to how the funds should be distributed, any brother or sister can bring this matter up in the prayer meetings. There is another brother, Brother Tu, who is now in Shantung. We hope that he also can assist in the management of the offering on the Lord's Days when he comes.</P><P>I want to mention that the funds of the work in Shanghai can be divided into three categories: (1) for the meeting's use, (2) for the work, the books and magazines, and (3) for individual workers. These three categories are independent of each other. The funds from the offering box for the meetings are for the expenses of the meeting hall. If money is marked for the literary work, it will be used to print books, magazines, and tracts. If it is marked for the work, we will consider the needs. Sometimes we will use it on the literary work and sometimes on other individual workers. The work never uses the funds of the meetings. As for the personal expenses of the workers, the Lord touches people to send them funds; these must be marked for their personal use. The money that individual workers receive is the money that has been explicitly marked on a note for their personal use. The funds in these three categories are not mixed with one another. From now on we ask the brothers in the meetings to manage the funds designated for the meetings because the local meetings have been raised up. My co-workers and I will manage the funds designated for the work. There is, of course, no question as to the funds designated for our personal expenses.</P><P>Now I want to present our financial condition so that we all can be clear. In this building, the rooms on the floor below are used for the meetings and the rent is paid by the fund from the meetings. The top floor is for myself, and I am personally responsible for the rent. Room No. 250A is rented by Miss Lee, Miss Miao, and Miss Chang. Miss Wang is renting her own place. The Gospel Book Room rents only a small place to store the books. My personal need is supplied by God. The other co-workers also receive their supply from God. We do not need others to bear our burdens. At the present time, the local meetings only pay two or three hundred dollars for rent yearly. When there is an excess, we give the money to other workers or to the work of the Lord. Concerning the literary work, the expenses for the publishing of the gospel tracts, the magazines Notes on Scriptural Messages, The Present Testimony, etc., are borne by myself and a few sisters who co-labor with me; the supply for these expenses comes from God's grace and His mercy, and through our prayers. This matter has no direct connection to you. It is something between us and the Lord. Therefore, we do not need to talk about it. Please pardon us.</P><P>Formerly we had some difficulty because the brothers were not clear about the truth of the church. (Please forgive me for saying this.) Therefore, we could only employ some temporary methods. We all met as believers, but there was no one to keep the accounting books. I myself do not know how to keep books. I cannot record clearly what is in and what is out. Therefore, I cannot manage the funds. If I had to keep the books, it would be very difficult for me. The sisters who work with us can no longer do it, and they should not be doing it. Several months ago, I was forced to do the bookkeeping temporarily.</P><P>According to the Bible, the offerings made by the believers in the meetings should be used for: (1) the local expenses, for example, rent, etc., (2) the relief of the brothers and sisters who are in poverty and want, and (3) the assistance of the workers and the expenses for the work, as commanded by the Bible. Actually, the workers of a locality should be supported by the believers of that locality. The funds of the meetings should be used in such a manner. The individual believer still has a responsibility towards relieving the poor and assisting the workers and the work. It seems embarrassing for me to make this statement. However, this is the truth; I must talk about it. Formerly the funds of the meetings were not used to assist the workers; they were used for the work in other localities, for example, the work in Kiangsu, England, Palestine, etc. This money was distributed to the workers responsible for the work in different localities, who are in fellowship with us. We need to do our best to supply them. The more we receive, the more we give away; the less we receive, the less we give away.</P><P>Now we have two offering boxes, and each box has two partitions. There are two openings on the top of each box. The funds for the church meetings should be put into one opening, and the funds for the work should be put into the other opening. This is necessary because, in the past, some have put funds meant for the work into the box for the meetings. In this way the meetings have taken advantage of the work. Therefore, please remember that if the funds are meant for the meetings, please put them into the opening marked "meetings"; if the funds are meant for the work, put them into the opening marked "work." (These are well-marked on the boxes.) If there is money designated for an individual worker, it should be wrapped up in paper with the name of the worker written on it. Although the boxes are there, the surplus or deficit of the funds for the work is the responsibility of the workers; they are not the responsibility of the brothers and sisters in the meetings.</P><P>According to the Bible, we should not accumulate money. Although this is the case, it does not mean we have to spend all of our monthly income in one month. Nevertheless, it is not good to purposely save money for next month. Therefore, every month we should distribute our funds according to what we have. Since the meetings do not use much, what is left can be used in other areas.</P><P>In the past, the fund for the meetings was managed by two sisters. Several months ago, it was managed by me. However, I do not know how to manage money. Because I am away much of the time, I privately asked Brother Chang to do the bookkeeping for me. Although the fund for the meetings is not too small, it is not that great either and is just enough for our use. From now on, we workers will no longer bear the burden of managing this fund. The brothers who manage the fund will give a monthly financial report to the church. In the past, it was the workers who managed the money. If there was a shortage, the workers made it up. If there was a surplus, we gave it to others. When there was a shortage, we did not feel good about asking you for money. Now that you are managing the fund, whether there is a lack or surplus, it will all be reported to you without reservation. Although only a few brothers are managing the fund, all of you may make suggestions in the prayer meetings as to how the fund should be spent. If you see a brother or a sister in need, you may also mention it in the prayer meetings. From now on, all the matters concerning the church may be discussed in every Thursday's prayer meeting. Thus, our prayer meetings are not merely prayer meetings; they are also meetings to discuss the affairs of the church. I hope the brothers and sisters will pray and understand the will of God in all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER</H2><P>Concerning the conference last October, I should have reported to you earlier. However, I took a few days to rest and was delayed until today to inform you of the situation. Thank God, He has already led us through all things! The making of the chairs cost over seven hundred dollars. The expenses for the conference were one thousand five hundred dollars. In total, we spent over two thousand two hundred dollars. Thank God, although we did not ask anyone for a penny directly or indirectly but only asked our Father in heaven, He has supplied all our needs. There were no large individual sums that came in during this conference. The sums were all in the amount of a few dollars to tens of dollars. The largest sum was two hundred thirty-one dollars; the smallest sum was a few dimes. Even so, the Lord has already led us through. We thank God and we also thank you for your help.</P><P>From now on, the workers will not be responsible for the meetings of the church. Two or three sisters and myself will manage the affairs of our little bookroom as well as the testimony God gave to us. The workers will manage the work. The affairs of the church should be managed by the believers. I hope that what I have said will make you understand the difference between the church and the work as well as the similarities between the workers and believers. I hope you are all clear about the teaching of the Bible concerning the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOTICES</H2><P>(1) Last year a book entitled Notes On Scriptural Messages was published.

Hebrews 12:24 tells us concerning the Lord's blood that "the blood...speaks something better than that of Abel." The blood of the Lord Jesus speaks something better than that of Abel. Why does the blood of the Lord Jesus speak something better than that of Abel? Today I would like to speak briefly about this.</P><P>Why was Abel killed? Cain killed him because he envied him. God looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering. Therefore, Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him in the field. Why did the Jews bring the Lord Jesus to the Praetorium before the governor? According to Pilate, "he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up" (Matt. 27:18). The only reason the Jews killed the Lord Jesus was that they envied the Lord. Abel was envied by Cain and killed by Cain. The Lord Jesus was envied by the Jews and killed by the Jews.</P><P>Why does the blood of the Lord Jesus speak something better than that of Abel? Abel's blood cried out to God from the ground, demanding God to avenge Him according to righteousness and judge the sin of the man who caused him to bleed. The blood of the Lord Jesus voiced its plea that God treat man with grace and forgive those who caused Him to bleed. The blood of Abel required that God execute righteousness. Once God executed righteousness, Adam's child, the sinful Cain, had no place to hide. The blood of the Lord Jesus requires God to execute righteousness also. But when God executes righteousness, He forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. The Lord Jesus died for us. Since God punished Him, He cannot punish us. God asked Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?" He said, "I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?" What if God asks us today, "Where is your brother Abel?" We thank and praise God that today we can answer: "He was killed by us, but His blood does not accuse us." The blood of the Lord Jesus does not accuse us. This is an amazing salvation!</P><P>Why does the Bible say that the blood can speak? First John says the blood testifies. The blood has two functions. One is to propitiate for us before God; the other is to provide a guarantee for us before God. Many people only see that the blood of the Lord Jesus propitiates for us but do not see that the blood of the Lord Jesus provides us a guarantee before God. The blood of the Lord is for redemption on the earth and for a testimony in the heavens; it testifies that redemption is accomplished on the earth. On earth the Lord shed His blood to be our Savior; in heaven He serves as our eternal Savior.</P><P>What happened on the great day of propitiation? The blood was poured onto the ground from the altar, and it was also brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest and put on the ark. The blood shed on the ground was gone after several days; it dried out and became dust. But the blood brought into the Holy of Holies speaks for us eternally. The blood shed on the ground is for propitiation, while the blood brought into the Holy of Holies speaks before Jehovah and testifies. On the one hand, the Lord shed His blood to forgive our sins and to make propitiation for us; on the other hand, the blood is put before God to speak and testify for us. The sprinkled blood in heaven testifies to the fact of the shed blood (propitiation) on the earth.</P><P>What does this blood testify? For the blood to be before God means that the fact of propitiation is before God. The blood voicelessly testifies before God and guarantees our eternal peace. If there was no shedding of blood (propitiation) on earth, where did this sprinkled blood before God come from? The blood testifies for God; it tells us that God loves us. Otherwise, where does this blood come from? At the same time, the blood testifies for us that we are saved. Otherwise, why was this blood shed? The blood testifies, on the one hand, the love of God and, on the other hand, our salvation. At the same time, it testifies to Satan so that he can no longer accuse us. Thank and praise God; what the blood of the Lord Jesus speaks is better than that of Abel. This blood is for forgiving, not for avenging; it is for peace, not for accusation.</P><P>Our Lord shed His blood once and accomplished everything. Today before God, we have the proof of our salvation. Some say that they are saved because of a certain time of repentance. Some say that they are saved because they were so happy after they prayed a certain time. But these feelings are not dependable. I am a saved person because the Lord's blood testifies before God. What the blood of the Lord speaks of is better than that of Abel. Abel's blood spoke from the ground and demanded the blood of the one who killed him. The blood of the Lord speaks from heaven and declares His forgiveness of the one who killed Him. The blood of the Lord testifies for us in heaven forever. Brothers and sisters, we thank and praise God that the blood of the Lord testifies in heaven! We seldom realize how the blood of the Lord speaks. If we did, our table here would take on new significance. The cup not only stands for and expresses something but also tells us that the blood is speaking. We thank and praise God because the blood of Christ cleanses us from all our sins. At the same time, the blood of Christ testifies for us before God. With this testimony, God cannot refuse us anything. Christ has already died and resurrected. Who can accuse us? We thank and praise God!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LOVE OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:35-39; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Eph. 3:14-19</H1><P>These three passages have one identical phrase, which is "the love of Christ." The Bible mentions the love of Christ many times, but only in these three cases does it specifically use this phrase. The rest of the time it speaks of the love of God. Strictly speaking, the love of Christ is the love of God. For example, in Romans 8:35 it says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" while in verse 39 it concludes, "Nor...will be able to separate us from the love of God." Thus we see the love of Christ and the love of God are one and the same. What I am going to speak about today is Christ's love towards three types of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LOVE OF CHRIST IN ROMANS 8<br>BEING FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING</H2><P>Every believer in this world has his unique experience, unique difficulty, and unique environment. Paul was saying that whatever problem we may have, the answer is always the love of Christ. Even if we have a hundred different kinds of difficulties, the solution is still the love of Christ. Some believers may encounter tribulation, some believers may be in anguish, others may encounter persecution, and still others, famine. Even if nakedness, peril, sword, etc. all come, they still cannot separate us from the love of Christ because the love of Christ can deal with all kinds of situations. Do we realize that after many people are captured by the love of Christ, they are able to pass through what other people cannot pass through?</P><P>A widow may live in great difficulty because of her husband's death. She may be unable to pay rent, and her possessions may be pawned. Under such circumstances, however, she still can keep her smile. When does she smile? When she looks at her child of less than one year in age, she smiles. The reason for her smile is love.</P><P>I really treasure the word in Romans 8:37 that "in all these things we more than conquer"! We more than conquer in all these things, not out of all these things. If all these things did not happen, there would be no need to overcome. Many people think if there is no tribulation, anguish, or persecution, etc., they can overcome. But the Word of God says, "In all these things we more than conquer." It is the love of Christ that enables us to overcome all the tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, and danger. The love of Christ is a power which enables us to overcome all these things. All of these are bitter, but because we have tasted the love of Christ, we do not feel bitter about them anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE LOVE OF CHRIST IN 2 CORINTHIANS 5<br>BEING FOR THOSE WHO ARE SERVANTS</H2><P>This love of Christ is for those who are servants, those who serve the Lord. "For the love of Christ constrains us" (v. 14). Constrains in the original text means something washed away by the torrent of water. This is the meaning here. The love of Christ carries us away like one being carried away by the power of water. David Livingstone said if someone could go to Africa for the slave business, would the love of Christ not be strong enough to constrain another to go to Africa? For that reason he went. Having been constrained by the love of Christ, he put aside his life, and countless numbers of people obtained life through him. Indeed, only the love of Christ can constrain a person. Love cannot be seen with the eyes. But once a person has tasted the sweetness and beauty of this love, it is impossible for him not to be washed away by its flow.</P><P>"We have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" (vv. 14-15). The love of Christ constrains us because we judge two things. First, if Christ died for all, then we all died. The love of Christ cannot be separated from the death of Christ; the reason for Christ's death is Christ's love. Second, those who live should no longer live to themselves but to the Lord who died and resurrected for them. This is the goal. I cannot help but live for Him because the love of Christ constrains me. I cannot hold onto my own standing anymore.</P><P>So many times we feel that it is so difficult to testify to a sinner. It seems that we blush before we even utter anything. When I was first saved, I wanted to testify to a classmate; but when I approached him, it was so difficult to open my mouth. I went to him again and again, and every time I found myself reluctant to open my mouth to speak of Jesus. But when we are constrained by the love of Christ, we cannot help but testify. If we could choose, we would rather choose not to testify. But when we are constrained by the love of Christ, we cannot help but testify. Praise the Lord, His love constrains us.</P><P>Many times, we find that preaching the gospel is not an easy thing. Famine and persecution are unavoidable. I have had the experience of being threatened with a pistol not to preach Jesus any more. I would rather stop the mouth of the pistol with my body, but I cannot stop speaking about Christ. His love carries me away. I always urge young believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord. This is because He loves us. A number of brothers ask me what they should do in order to be a full-time evangelist. Unless we have to, it is better not to be a full-time preacher. Unless we have the feeling of "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" (1 Cor. 9:16), it is better that we not try to be a full-time preacher. Only when we find Him irresistible will others find Him irresistible. Those who preach the gospel must do so through the constraining of Christ's love. I am not exhorting everyone to be a full-time preacher. However, every believer should testify. Brothers and sisters, have you ever told anyone of the love of Christ? Have you ever felt the love of God burning like a fire within you to the extent that you cannot help but speak of His love? Brothers and sisters! May the love of Christ fill us and constrain us today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE LOVE OF CHRIST IN EPHESIANS 3<br>BEING FOR THOSE WHO ARE LIKE STUDENTS</H2><P>Ephesians 3:14-19: "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father...that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God." Here the love of Christ is for those who are like students. Paul was a very learned man. Would Paul make a grammatical mistake and write poorly? Those who have read the original text of the New Testament agree that all the letters Paul wrote used complicated and difficult grammar. But in Ephesians 3, when he spoke of the love of Christ, Paul's grammar was wrong; his writing was not proper Greek. After writing the phrase, "apprehend with all the saints," he stopped. All of a sudden, he wrote these four words: "the breadth and length and height and depth." It seems that there is no connection between the previous text and the following text. Brothers and sisters, this is the real condition of one who speaks of the love of Christ. When Paul came to this point, he did not know how to go on, and he shouted, "The breadth! and length! and height! and depth!" He could not describe it. Even if we were to use the best rhetoric to describe the love of Christ, what we comprehend would be very different from what it really is. When we consider the love of Christ, it seems that our mind becomes powerless; we do not know how to describe it.</P><P>The word know is the same in meaning as the word apprehend. The love of Christ is incomprehensible, yet at the same time it is very apprehensible. Day after day while we live on earth, we learn a little more of the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ's love. There was a preacher who felt a great pressure once while he was preaching. He wanted to speak, but he could not utter anything. So he requested others to pray for him. While all the people were praying, one black person repeated over and over again, "Precious Jesus!" The preacher heard him praying this way for more than an hour. Later, the preacher said, "I have nothing to preach today, but I heard one sentence from a prayer: `Precious Jesus!'"</P><P>Because of the constraining of Christ's love, we love Him though we have not seen Him. Because we believe in Him, we know that He is precious.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>RUNNING THE RACE THAT IS<br>SET BEFORE US</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 26</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:1-3</H1><P>Hebrews 11 mentions Abel, Enoch, and many other men of old and tells us how they did many things "by faith." What does this mean? Here we are shown one very important thing that is indispensable to every Christian. This is faith. In 2:3, it mentions "so great a salvation." This salvation is not the initial salvation; it refers to the entrance into Canaan, which is the entrance into the kingdom with the Son of God. In this kingdom we reign with Christ. This is the gospel of the kingdom.</P><P>God puts two things before man. First, He puts eternal life before the sinner. Second, He puts the kingdom before the man who has obtained eternal life. He who believes has eternal life. However, "unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 5:20). "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 7:21). From these two verses we can see that obtaining eternal life only requires our believing, but there are other qualifications for entering into the kingdom.</P><P>Once a man is saved, God puts him into a race. The entire Christian life is a race. This race is not for obtaining eternal life. On the contrary, only those who already have eternal life are qualified to run the race. At the end of the race, some will receive a crown, while others will not receive a crown (1 Cor. 9:24-25).</P><P>What is a crown? A crown represents a kingdom. A crown is the symbol of kingship, reigning, and glory. Receiving the crown means to obtain the kingdom, which is to become kings to reign and receive glory with the Lord Jesus. Not receiving the crown means missing the kingdom, and failing to reign, rule, and receive glory with the Lord Jesus. The crown is the symbol of the kingdom. There is no problem with a Christian obtaining eternal life. However, his obtaining of the kingdom depends on how he runs the race.</P><P>After a man is saved, God puts him in a race which is aimed directly at the kingdom. All his words, conduct, thoughts, living, and everything about him have to do with whether or not he will obtain the kingdom in the future. Those who do not join the race have judged themselves unworthy of obtaining the kingdom. Those who do not run the race properly have delayed their obtaining of the kingdom. God has already put every Christian on this way. Whether or not we will obtain the kingdom depends on us. Our abandon, consecration, faithfulness, and victory will make us those that receive the crown. But those who desire the world and walk according to their flesh will see that although they have eternal life through the Lord Jesus, the kingdom of heaven is still not theirs.</P><P>What are the "witnesses" mentioned in Hebrews 12:1? Apparently, it refers to those who have great faith as mentioned in chapter eleven. Actually, it does not refer to the people themselves but to the things they did. The word witness is the same in the original language as in Acts 1:8 and 2:32. The Word of God tells us that the witnesses of the things done by those people are like a great cloud surrounding us.</P><P>What do these many witnesses witness? They witness to God's "great salvation" (Heb. 2:3-4). This great salvation is not only the forgiveness of sins but obtaining the kingdom. The kingdom is the goal of our race. God gave us so many witnesses for the purpose of encouraging us to live a life of faith so that we can run the race and receive the glory of the kingdom. Although the great men of faith in chapter eleven did not have the kingdom directly as their object of faith, their faith was nevertheless their race. For them to believe so recklessly was a kind of laying aside of everything for the running of the race. Apparently, they obtained what they believed in; some were raptured, some obtained the land, some were resurrected, and some were saved from perishing. But these things are not God's ultimate promise to them. What they had obtained through faith was only their earnest, proving that they would obtain the promised kingdom of God. "And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise, because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect" (Heb. 11:39-40). What is this talking about? It is about the kingdom. They had obtained the earnest, and this earnest is God's assurance to them that they would obtain the kingdom in the future.</P><P>"So great a cloud of witnesses," is the grace given by God through the faith of many people. God answered their prayers and worked miracles; He proved that their running of the race was well-pleasing to Him and that they would possess the kingdom. Since we have all these witnesses, we should run the race of faith.</P><P>God has put the kingdom before us, and He has given us a race to run. At the end of the race, we will see if we have failed or won. The winner will reign with the Lord, while the loser, though saved, will have nothing to do with the glory of the kingdom.</P><P>The race is already set, and those who want to run have to "put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us." There are two crucial things in running a race. First, we have to lay aside every weight, and second, we have to put away our sin.</P><P>Let us consider first the putting away of sin. Sin is the greatest hindrance to our progress. Sin causes a runner to lose his qualification. Sin is a violation. A violator will not be allowed to run the race but will be taken out of the race.</P><P>We should put aside and reject all the known sins. Envy, pride, filthiness in the heart, lies in the mouth, impatience in our disposition, and debauchery of lusts will all disqualify us from being a runner. Disqualified runners will not be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven or to reign with the Lord Jesus. Believers must stand upon Romans 6:6 and 6:11 and must reckon themselves to be dead to sin. At the same time, we must also reject sin and not allow it to have dominion over us; we should present our members as weapons of righteousness unto God. We have to thoroughly confess, repent, and renounce all our offenses before God and seek His forgiveness. We cannot run the race set before us with an accusing conscience. We should not have any sin that has not been denied and that leaves a prolonged guilty conscience within us. If we have offended anyone, we should confess to him properly. If we owe someone any material thing, we should repay him according to our ability. We should not have any offense against anyone that has not been dealt with. Do not be afraid of losses and do not be afraid of losing face. Otherwise, we will not be able to run the race. Moreover, we have to realize that the appearance of some sins is not bad, and they easily beguile us. Moses chose "rather to be ill treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin" (Heb. 11:25). This shows us that sin has its enjoyment. Many sins make people feel happy. Man's flesh likes to sin because sin is something enjoyable. But we who have a true faith would rather suffer affliction and insult than have the enjoyment of sin. We should reject sin; otherwise, we will judge ourselves unworthy of the kingdom.</P><P>Consider again the words, "put away every encumbrance [weight]." What is a weight? A weight is not necessarily a sin nor something very bad. But it is something which easily besets us. If we do not remove the sin, we will lose our qualification in the race. However, if we do not lay aside our weight, even if we are qualified to run, we will not run fast. Have we ever seen a person running with his leather coat and his jacket on? Anything that hinders us from running fast or advancing forward is a weight.</P><P>In the nineteenth century there was a man who was greatly used by the Lord, who spent a great deal of time compiling a dictionary of Hebrew words. When it was completed, he sent it to his friends for review. His friends praised him much for his effort and considered that once this dictionary was published, he would become a well-known scholar. But, this brother eventually burned up the manuscript of the dictionary. He said, "The time of compiling [the dictionary] has decreased my love for the Lord and my love for the soul of man. Proofreading and printing will take up more time. I would rather burn it up." The proofreading and printing were not a sin, but to him they were a weight, and he chose to lay aside his weight. Although something is not sin, is it a weight to us? Will these things help us go on? Anything that frustrates our progress is a weight. Even a piece of clothing or a meal may become our weight. If we are going to run a race, and someone invites us for a bowl of noodles, or asks us to put on an overcoat, will we still be able to run the race? Therefore, we should not only remove our sin but should also lay aside every weight. If there is any weight upon us, we will never be able to run properly.</P><P>Lot failed because of the weight upon him. Lot himself was not a bad man but a righteous man who was oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless (2 Pet. 2:7). But his living was different from that of Abraham. Abraham was living in the wilderness, and Lot was in the city. Abraham was living in a tent, and Lot was in a house. This was their difference-one was light and the other had a weight. Although he could run with a weight, eventually he failed because he could not run well.</P><P>We have to pay attention to what was said in Mark 4:19. The Lord did not say that we are fruitless because of sin, but "the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts for other things" cause us to bear no fruit. We do not need to sin; only a little care of the world will cause us to bear no fruit. Riches are not sin, but riches will surely not help us to fly away with two wings. Whoever intends to be a rich man will never run a good race. We have to fulfill all our God-given duties. But if our heart is entangled by anything, we will not be able to run well.</P><P>Weight is not sin; in many cases, it may even be something legal. But it is still a weight and will reduce our speed in going forward. Perhaps our weight is a friendship which we cannot give up, a position which we are pursuing, a little bit of worldly ambition, a pleasant house, a bowl of delicious food, or a beautiful dress. Although these things and thousands of other things are not sin, they will hinder us from running in a fast way.</P><P>Therefore, we should check ourselves. Is there any sin that disables us from running? What is the weight that hinders us from running in a fast way? Sin disqualifies us from being a runner and drives us out of the race. Weight causes us to run badly, even to labor in vain. What is our special sin? What is our particular weight? We have to search out these sins and weights and remove them.</P><P>Those who run the race should not only lay aside the sin which so easily entangles them and every weight but should also run the race that is set before them with endurance. Why with endurance? Because the prize is not given at the beginning of the race, nor is it given in the middle of the race. Rather, it is given at the end-the very last step-of the race. We may run well at the start, and we may even run well at the mid-point, but we will not necessarily run well at the end. A victory involves winning at the beginning, at the mid-point, and at the end. Before reaching the end, we cannot guarantee that we will win the prize. We may fail in the last five steps. Once in a two hundred meter running race, a man was ahead of the other competitors by twenty meters at first. No one expected that he would fall down just two meters before the finish line. If we want to win the race, we have to be careful. We cannot say that we will surely win the prize before reaching the end. Even Paul said, "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue" (Phil. 3:12). How about us?</P><P>What is to "run"? To "run" means to not stand still, it means to not walk slowly. It means to run forward fast and finish the longest distance within the shortest time. In other words, it means to run fast. Since there are many competitors, one has to be ahead of others if he wants to win the crown. Whether or not we win depends on how fast we run. If we waste our time and linger about, we will surely fail.</P><P>We are running the race which is set before us. There is only one race, which is the race set before us. We cannot choose the race we want to run. We have to run what God sets before us. In a race, who would dare run outside of the track? Everyone must run inside the track that is drawn for him. This is what 2 Timothy 2:5 says, "Also if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully." Unfortunately, many Christians, though running zealously, are not running the race set by God. All our own zeal, labor, and activities can never replace God's will. All the running outside of God's will eventually results in loss. God has set the race before us. We must run this race in order to gain the prize.</P><P>Our feet have to run right inside the track drawn by God.  Our eyes have to be "looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:2). That means we have to look away from all other things and look to Jesus. We should not look at anything else but should look only at Jesus. Only when we look unto Jesus can we run straight. Many things around us may affect our vision and change our goal. Only by looking unto Jesus will we run the race from beginning to end.</P><P>He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith. Our faith is initiated by Him and perfected by Him. What we believe in is only Himself. Once we are in the Lord, we have to always abide in Him. We should set our mind only on the Lord Jesus. Even things like holiness, victory, perfect love, baptism in the Spirit, zeal in rescuing the perishing ones, spiritual warfare, and so on should not capture our hearts. All the "beginnings" and "endings" should depend on the Lord Jesus. Our faith should begin in Him and finish in Him. We must not look unto anything other than Christ. If we look unto Jesus only, things such as holiness and victory will spontaneously be manifested in our lives. But if we seek for anything apart from Christ, those things will only make our path crooked. In this spiritual journey, we must pray for revelation from God, so that we see that everything is in Christ. Forgiveness, justification, and regeneration are in Christ. Holiness, victory, the filling of the Spirit, and so on are also in Christ. Everything is Christ. He is the very beginning of the beginning, the very end of the end. He is the Alpha; He is the Omega. Everything of us depends on Him. Apart from Him, we cannot run the race set before us.</P><P>"Looking away" is the precondition of looking unto the Lord. Unless we look away from all other things, we can never look unto the Lord. Those who look around while running the race will never run well. They will either run into a wrong track or will stop altogether. Therefore, God does not want us to look unto anything else but Him. Furthermore, even looking back inside ourselves is a harmful thing in our spiritual journey. All kinds of introspection, self-analysis of our own feeling, self-consideration of our own progress, or even excessive concern about our own spirituality will hinder our progress. One of the greatest dangers in running the race lies in a subconscious introspection in the runners due to their anxiety over progress. The result is that we cannot look away unto Jesus. What is looking unto Jesus? Looking unto Jesus is not looking at ourselves. Looking unto Jesus is being drawn by Jesus from our inside world and joining ourselves to the One whom we are looking unto. Who is the Jesus we are looking unto? We look unto the Jesus who is the Author and Perfecter of our faith; He is the all-inclusive Jesus. The key to spiritual progress is to know in a proper way how to not look back on our own situation. Blessed are those who do not look at themselves. May the Spirit of God reveal to us what looking away means and what an improper looking back is.</P><P>Let us see how the Lord Jesus ran the race. He, "for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God." The Lord Jesus ran straight by looking unto the joy set before Him. What kind of joy is this? He Himself had said, "Good and faithful slave...enter into the joy of your master" (Matt. 25:21). This refers to the joy of His millennial reign. According to His holy nature, our Lord is submissive to God. But the Bible also reveals another side of the truth: God's reward and approval, especially the kingdom, exercised some influence on Him. Our Lord went through all the shame and the cross and never drew back because of the joy set before Him.</P><P>Why does the Bible say, "Jesus," the Author and Perfecter of our faith rather than saying "Christ" or "Lord Jesus" (the address after His resurrection)? We know Jesus is His name as a man. God wants us to look unto Jesus so that we will look unto His human aspect. He is submissive to God by His nature; this refers to His divine aspect. He despised all the shame, enduring the cross for the joy set before Him; this refers to His human aspect. This is why the Spirit specifically mentions "Jesus," to show us that the prize also had considerable effect on Him as a man. It is right for us to obey God out of love for Him. But on the other hand, since God wants to motivate us to serve Him faithfully by means of the prize, it is not wrong for us to serve Him faithfully for the sake of the prize before us.</P><P>Why did Paul "forget...the things which are behind and stretch...forward to the things which are before," and "pursue toward the goal"? His own answer was "for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward" (Phil. 3:13-14). The prize was the high calling of God, and Paul left all that he had for it. God is pleased when we serve Him faithfully for the sake of the prize.</P><P>Our Lord "endured" and "despised"  because of the joy of the kingdom. How about us? Brothers and sisters, have we ever left anything for the glory of the kingdom? Have we ever quit doing what we wanted to do or done what we did not want to do for the sake of the prize from God? If this joy captured our Lord, can it not capture us? Many saints, in ancient times as well as today, left all they had for the sake of the kingdom's glory and followed Jesus. How about us?</P><P>Jesus, the One we look unto, is such a Jesus. He "for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. 12:2). This is His case. In principle, the process should be the same for us too.</P><P>Shame was given to Him by men, and He despised it. The cross was given to Him by God, and He endured it. He was misunderstood, expelled, accused, forsaken, and condemned by people, but He did not care. It was not that the shame was never very severe; the shame He encountered was something ordinary men have never encountered. It was not that His holy emotion did not feel shame when He was insulted; His feeling was probably keener than that of anyone else. However, He despised it; He did not pay attention to the shame. The cross God gave Him was not light. What He went through before men, demons, and angels was not something easy. However, our Lord endured the cross. He took it. He endured it. What was the result? He was victorious to the end and "has sat down on the right hand of the throne," waiting for the appearance of glory.</P><P>How we like to save our face! We are afraid of being shamed, misunderstood, criticized, and opposed. We try our best to be a nice person. We avoid being shamed. We are not willing to deny ourselves or to be shamed for the Lord's sake. Even when we take the shame, we take it reluctantly. We are not willing to take such shame (which decreases our soul-life) silently, without any self-defense, and without trying to escape.</P><P>We are not willing to bear the cross which God gives to us. We are not walking on the way of the cross. We do not even know what the way of the cross is. We do not know that whatever happens to us is permitted by God. Everything that is contrary to our intention, that puts false charges against us, causes us painful feelings, frustrates us in our environment, and evaporates our hope, are crosses from God. How do we treat these things? Does our heart resist them? Do we complain to others? Do we wish that these things would go away? Any rebellious attitude within us will cause us not to run well in the race.</P><P>God allows each cross to come upon us with a special purpose. Each cross has its own special mission and its own special accomplishment in us. If we endure it according to God's will, just as the Lord Jesus endured His cross (note that His cross was for redemption, while ours is not), our natural life will be dealt with one more time. We will become more enlarged to be filled with the resurrection life of the Son of God. Our resistance and rebellion, as well as our strength in struggling to escape, will frustrate God's purpose and cause the cross to come upon us in vain. They will cause us to fail in what God wants to accomplish.</P><P>God set the Lord Jesus before us so that we may imitate Him. In closing, this passage tells us, "compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls" (Heb. 12:3). "Such" here indicates the way that He was disgraced, insulted, mistreated, forsaken, scourged, hurt, crucified (the cross also having its aspect from men), and so on. We should compare with care and compare these things one by one. In this way, we will not be weary and faint in our souls. When the Lord mentioned His persecution on earth to His disciples, He said, "A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master." We cannot expect to be treated any better than the Lord Jesus was treated. "It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master." It is good that we are not treated worse than the Lord Jesus. For "if they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!" (Matt. 10:24-25). Since He suffered all this ill-treatment on earth, how about us? If we consider these things, we will not be weary or faint in our souls even though we suffer and are disgraced and opposed.</P><P>One of the most dreadful things in the race toward the kingdom is being weary and faint in the soul. The soul is the organ of the emotion, mind, and will. Growing "weary, fainting in your souls" means being without strength in the soul. The will becomes paralyzed, the feeling cools down, and the mind loses interest. Everything seems to be vain, and we allow everything to take its natural course. "Whether or not I will receive a crown in the future is up to fate." One of the greatest temptations in running the race is that when all the things against us have swamped us, and we are unable to resist them, we simply give in to them and refuse to run seriously any more in order to gain the heavenly crown.</P><P>If we are willing to consider the Lord Jesus and examine His experience, we will not give in in this way. Gideon and his three hundred men were "faint, yet pursuing" (Judg. 8:4). We ought to be "faint, yet running."</P><P>May we all be persons who run the race. May we all be running until the end. Even if we are hurt, offended, misunderstood, and rejected while running, we still have to cheer up and run the race unwearily for the sake of the Lord Jesus. Who receives the most praises in a race? It is the one who is hurt, who rises up again, and who finally wins the first place. This person will surely receive unceasing praises. Therefore, being hurt and suffering are not a problem; even failing is not a problem. The one who falls down and rises up again is still the best runner. Brothers and sisters, today we are all in the race. Nothing counts today; everything will receive its final judgment at the end of the race. We should not give up, become weary, or faint in our soul for any reason. We ought to look unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith and run the race set before us!</P></body></html>
