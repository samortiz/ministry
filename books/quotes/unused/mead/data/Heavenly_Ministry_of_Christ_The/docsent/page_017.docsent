   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST S EXECUTION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Heb 7:16, 25; 9:11-12, 15-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Hebrews 7 through 10 Christ is presented in a threefold way: as High Priest, as Minister, and as Executor of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ is mentioned as the High Priest, we are also told that He is the Minister of the holy places and the Executor of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three titles are mentioned together because their functions overlap.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While Christ is carrying on His priestly work, He is also executing the new testament and simultaneously ministering its contents to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider how He executes the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the most complicated point in the New Testament for us to understand, yet it is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD S SPEAKING TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout the Bible God s speaking was in three ways: His word, His promise, and His covenant or testament .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God s speaking there was His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When His promise was enacted by an oath, it became a covenant, which is also a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the very beginning God spoke to man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before Adam disobeyed, God spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the fall God came again to speak to him, this time promising that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With God s speaking came God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same was true with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God s speaking to him, He promised him a seed and the good land Gen 13:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God spoke and God promised.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How did the promise become a covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was by the addition of an oath with a sacrifice where blood was shed e.g., Gen 15:7-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A covenant is an agreement in which one party promises certain things to the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A testament, in turn, is a bequest of what has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In modern terms it is a will, a written legal statement for the distribution of the enactor s property upon his death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire Bible is actually God s testament; its two parts are even called the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more He speaks the more He is bound by His words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He cannot help but speak!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has much to say to man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is full of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This book is God s word to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we speak, we may unconsciously make promises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we get others to talk to us, we may be able to induce them to promise us something they had no intention of promising.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as they are quiet, we cannot ensnare them; but when they speak, we may be able to get a commitment from them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In both the Old and New Testaments He has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His speaking He has made promises.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible is full of promises.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Promises to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To David.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To us, the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord Jesus had not died, these promises would have remained only promises.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But to fulfill these promises He did die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By the shedding of His blood these promises became a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now there is a firm commitment for them to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this covenant some things are yet to be done, and some have been accomplished already and have been bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The covenant then has become a testament, telling us what our inheritance is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And because of this He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For a testament is confirmed where there has been death, since it has no force when he who made it is living Heb 9:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The new covenant, consummated with the blood of Christ Heb 9:11-14 , is not merely a covenant, but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Firstly God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant Jer 31:31-34; Heb 8:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then Christ shed His blood to enact it Luke 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since there are accomplished facts promised in this covenant, it is also a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This testament, or will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ s death, and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The promise of God s covenant is insured by God s faithfulness; God s covenant is guaranteed by God s righteousness; and the testament is enforced by Christ s resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible first tells us that Christ will come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then it promises us that He will come.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is not only the speaking but the promise as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many blessings are included in this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will die for us that our sins might be forgiven and that we might be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Life will be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This life is the Spirit, who is God Himself as everything to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Finally, we shall inherit whatever God is, whatever He has, and whatever He does.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After God s speaking and His promising including the content of His promise , Christ went to the cross and died, shedding His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because of His death, the promise has been consummated, the covenant has been established, and the testament has been enacted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have, then, four stages in God s speaking to man: His speaking, His promising, His covenant-making, and His testament-executing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Adam in Genesis 2 was in the first stage.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Abraham in Genesis 12 was in the second, or promising, stage.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The disciples, when they saw Christ dying on the cross, were in the third, the covenant-making, stage.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We today are in the fourth stage, when the testament is executed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God has spoken, He has promised, Christ has made the covenant, and the covenant has become a testament to us.</S>
