   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HANDLING OUR CHANGING MOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may get up in the morning and find that your spirit is on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when you get home from work that evening, you are as cold as a block of ice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There seems no reason.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hallelujah, when your spirit is frozen, you have the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may open to John 4:23.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Read it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As you do, your reading will become your praying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may say something like this: "O Lord, an hour is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, the hour has come and now is."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With just one hallelujah the ice is melted, and you are filled with the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The coldness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not need to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It just disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same is true with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, this is the way to take care of your whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not try to overcome your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today He is both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Spirit He is in me, and as the Word He is here in this Book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether I am hot or cold, the Word remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However I fluctuate during the day, the Word is always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It always says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you think this is practicing psychology, try picking up a book about Abraham Lincoln or the thoughts of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such books do not provoke such a response in you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is the Bible the only book that can stir you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because "the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither the words of Abraham Lincoln nor those of Confucius are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only the words of the Bible that are spirit, for these are the words spoken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah for this inheritance of the Spirit within and the Word without!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit may seem to disappear, but the Word always remains.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Learn to contact the Lord through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I encourage you to build up a habit of reading the Word daily, preferably in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Make this a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>KEEPING SOME LEGALITIES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To live we have to keep some legalities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be legal about four things: eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you think it is too legal to eat three meals every day?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without such a legality you will soon be ready for a funeral!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to live in a healthy way, you must eat, drink, breathe, and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am careful to practice these four legalities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is why I am still so energetic even at my age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without such practices, you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now there are some spiritual legalities you must pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to live and be healthy spiritually, you must practice these daily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Especially you young brothers, you must have at least ten minutes of prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you must also have at least ten minutes for reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You can read a chapter in ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you insist on keeping these legalities, you will be a strong, healthy Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Look to the Lord for His grace to practice them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE VALUE OF READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose you have no interest in praying or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have done it for a while and you seem to get nothing out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I know the story.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you will keep these two legalities for half a year, you will see the difference it makes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then if you are still bored, stop for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This will give you a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You will see what a loss it is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you try to put water into a strainer, the water will flow right out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However many times you try, no water will stay in the strainer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the strainer nonetheless is getting washed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every day when you read the Bible, it seems that nothing remains.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But your being is washed, your person refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you neglect your Bible reading for ten days, you will see how dull and dirty you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Reading the Bible makes you different, whether you sense you have received something or not.</S>
