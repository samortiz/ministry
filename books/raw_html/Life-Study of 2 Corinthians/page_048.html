<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">ATTACHED, ANOINTED, SEALED, CAPTURED,<br /> SUBDUED, AND LED<br />TO SCATTER THE INCENSE OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 2:14-16</h1><p>Paul is a pattern of living Christ for the church. According to his word in 2 Corinthians, if we would live Christ for the church, we need to be attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ. In 2:14 Paul says, &ldquo;But thanks be to God, Who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.&rdquo; In this verse Paul uses two metaphors: captives in a triumphal procession and incense-bearers scattering incense in such a procession. As incense-bearers, the apostles scatter the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphal ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles are such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ and captives in the train of His triumph as well. Paul was attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ. We also need to experience all these matters so that we may scatter the incense of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SCATTERING INCENSE</h2><p>Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 and 2:14-16 are wonderful verses. In these five verses there are a number of marvelous truths. According to 1:21 and 22, we must be firmly attached to Christ, we must be anointed by God, and we must be sealed with the Spirit. Furthermore, according to 2:14-16, we need to be captured, subdued, and led. All this is that we may scatter the incense of our Savior, the incense of the One whom we love to the uttermost. In my ministry I am not merely a teacher or a preacher&mdash;I am one scattering the incense of my Lord. I am beside myself with love for Him, and I desire to scatter His incense. Every one in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be a person scattering the incense of Christ. Wherever we go we should scatter this incense.</p><p>Some have wondered why a number of Christians in this country have been willing to receive my ministry. The reason is that I am scattering the incense of Christ. This is my unique occupation, my unique profession. My major in the heavenly university was scattering the incense of Christ. I expect that in the years to come many among us, especially the young people, will rise up to scatter Christ&rsquo;s incense. Young people, your aspiration should be to scatter the incense of Christ. Regarding this, you need to say, &ldquo;By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, I shall become one who scatters the incense of Christ wherever I go.&rdquo;</p><p>I believe that in the next ten years many of today&rsquo;s young people will become those who scatter the incense of Christ. I believe there will still be time for the young people to grow up and be used by the Lord. Because of the immaturity of Christians, the bride is not yet ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The Lord will not come for the bride until she is mature and ready for Him. Until the bride is prepared, the Lord will continue to execute God&rsquo;s government and carry on His heavenly ministry to hasten the process of our maturing. We cannot mature overnight. Anything of life needs time to grow. It is possible to make hundreds of artificial flowers in a day, but genuine flowers need time to grow. I believe that during the time required for the bride to grow and mature, many young people will scatter the incense of Christ. In the years to come, the Lord may lead certain ones to different places. Wherever we may go, we should scatter the incense.</p><p>I can testify that the opposition to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is actually a positive sign. It is a sign that the recovery truly is of the Lord and that it is His move on earth. Hallelujah, we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery! We are growing up, and we are being raised up to scatter the incense of Christ.</p>
