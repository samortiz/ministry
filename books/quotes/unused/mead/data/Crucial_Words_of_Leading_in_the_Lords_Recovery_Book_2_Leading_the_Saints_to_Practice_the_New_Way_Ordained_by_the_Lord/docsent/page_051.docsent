   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST To Hold On to Some Special Creeds</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being to Build Up One s Own Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the earth today there are many Christians in different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Taipei there are Baptist churches, Presbyterian churches, and Bread of Life churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, people may tell us that it is good to love the Lord but that it is possible that we have been deceived because even though we say that others are sects, are we not also a sect?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us consider our fingers as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A hand has five fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Names such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church are like a sixth finger in addition to the five fingers of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The local churches do not have six fingers because we do not have a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are proper and normal; we have only five fingers, not six.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is an extra finger, that finger is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The preachers of the Baptist Church are carrying out the ministry of the New Testament, but they are also carrying out the ministry of the baptism of the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their work is to establish the Baptist sect, that is, the Baptist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, the Presbyterians establish Presbyterian sects, and the Pentecostals establish tongue-speaking sects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, every denomination builds up its own sect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We, however, are simply and purely building up the Body of Christ, which is expressed in all the localities as a local church, a church not belonging to any sect or denomination and that is not divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In one area of the United States almost one hundred brothers came into the Lord s recovery out of the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of their parents were pastors and deacons in the Baptist Church, having a strong denominational background.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result of our introducing something new into the area, the Baptist Church began to pay much attention to us, and arranged for a theologian with a doctoral degree to come to join our conference and listen to my preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the meeting he came to me in a humble and meek way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a proper person with a refined manner of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, he was a highly educated and knowledgeable person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our conversation he frequently made reference to his Doctorate of Divinity, but I did not pay attention to that; rather, I asked him whether being Baptist is something extra, and I also asked him for some explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we ask people this kind of question, they are caught, because even though baptism is in the Bible and baptism is right, to make it an item of the faith is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, although the matter of the elders administration of the church is also in the Bible, to make it an item of the faith and a basis for establishing the church is also heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, although tongue-speaking is right, it is also heresy to make tongue-speaking an item of the faith and a basis for establishing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a Christian nation such as the United States, whenever a person finds out that someone else is a Christian, the first question he asks is, Which denomination do you belong to?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, my question was not too blunt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I asked this theologian whether being Baptist was something extra, he had nothing to say; all he could say was that there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I then asked him how there could be no other way, and I pointed out to him that baptism is just baptism and should not be made an article of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, the Baptists acknowledge only the baptisms that are conducted by their pastors, and even the water for baptism must be the water in their baptisteries.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I told him that this is superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After all, there are many regenerated Christians who have not been baptized in the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can the Baptists recognize only those who are baptized among them?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told him that although my mother was a member of the Baptist Church, I neither joined that church nor was baptized there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, I have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He could not deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later he told people that it would be best for him not to see me again, because he could not win.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently, another Baptist theologian came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He came with a younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After conversing with them for a while, I realized that this visit was different from those in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They knew not to bring up the problem of division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They knew that if they were to bring it up, they would not have a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, they did not talk about divisions but spoke of positive matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the end, they told me that they wanted to put my books in their collection for theological studies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I heard this, I asked them under which category they would put my books.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One category in their collection consisted of books on the orthodox faith, another consisted of books on the Pentecostal faith, another consisted of books concerning those faiths that are questionable in regard to accuracy, and yet another consisted of books concerning special creeds in regard to baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I asked them under which category they would put my books.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was difficult for them to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Finally I told them that if they desired to put my books in their collection, they would have to add a new category: the most fundamental truths.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the situation in America.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today nearly every denomination teaches from the Bible, preaches the same Savior, and worships the same true God, but every denomination also has its own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ministry of the Baptists builds up Baptist churches, and the ministry of the Presbyterians builds up Presbyterian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person desires to be a preacher in the Baptist Church, he would need to be baptized in their midst and graduate from their seminary; otherwise, it would be difficult for him to become a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, they would investigate his background; if his parents and grandparents were members of the Baptist denomination, there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if he was from another denomination or had graduated from a seminary of another denomination, it would not be easy for him to become a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If this were the case, he would be required to be baptized in their midst and become an official member of the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moreover, he would also need to agree to preach only the Baptist faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the work of the Baptist denomination is entirely to carry out the ministry of the Baptist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we consecrate ourselves to serve the Lord full time, the work we do is the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we speak to people, they may not know us and thus think that we have a special title; nevertheless, on our part we know that we are all doing the work of the one ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
