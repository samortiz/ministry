   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are some who talk so much about the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is wonderful and so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where is the universal church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is so heavenly, so spiritual, so eternal, so wonderful, and so marvelous, but where is it today?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is really invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are so much for the universal church say that the invisible church is the real one, and all the visible churches are the false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, it is easy to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They tell you that something is wonderful, but if you ask them where it is, they can only say that it is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is so heavenly, so spiritual, so eternal, so wonderful, and so marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it is invisible today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is just invisibly wonderful, invisibly heavenly, invisibly spiritual, and invisibly eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But where is its practicality?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that someday we will be in the church in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we get to heaven, the church age will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when we get into the New Jerusalem, that will not be the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today is the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not talk about the church in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is not something in the future; the church is something of today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is not something in the heavens but in the places where we are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord, there is a church in Los Angeles today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even in this evil district of Hollywood there is a church today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Gospels, in Matthew 16, the Lord began to talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in Acts, in all the Epistles, and in Revelation the main matter concerns the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the Bible is mainly about the church, we must have something practical today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is necessary for the Lord s return, and this is a real shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I say again loudly and clearly that in the city that is famous for Hollywood, nearly the most evil city on the earth, there is a church today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a golden lampstand in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a real glory to Christ and a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some Christian teachers say that in this evil age it is an impossibility to have a real church; we must wait until that day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all must reject this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is one hundred percent wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The future age is not the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the future age begins, the church age will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is like someone telling us to see a football game tomorrow morning, but when we get there, the game is over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The game was not in the morning but the night before.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must go to see the game tonight and not wait until tomorrow morning; then it will be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord, we are in the game now!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how dark or how evil the age is, we are in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are playing the game here in the local church today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE TIDE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let me tell you what is on my heart and deep within my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From what I have seen in the past six years in traveling through this country, I am fully convinced that the Lord is sweeping over the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is sweeping from the West Coast to the East Coast for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There has been a rumor in the past two or three years that there will be a big earthquake with a tidal wave on the West Coast, and Los Angeles will drop into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I heard this, I said, Yes, there will be a big earthquake, but not for this city to go down into the ocean but to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There will be a tide, but it will be a tide of the local churches sweeping throughout the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you do not believe me, simply wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can stand against this tide.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the Lord s doing, and this is the Lord s moving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a human movement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before His return, the Lord must recover the church life in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He must build up the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have the full assurance that the Lord will use the United States for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not care what people say about the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are so many opinions, but I say that they are all nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord will keep and protect the United States for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord will keep this country to recover the local churches as a real preparation for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what I mean when I say that we must be up to date with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord is moving to recover the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of the tide, the flood, the moving, of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Brethren saw the doctrine, but they stopped there; they would not go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the Lord could not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord went on to recover the reality and the spirituality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the first group began to criticize the second group: they said that the spirituality was not according to the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, they started to be and still are against the second group.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the sad story has been repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The second group was used by the Lord in the beginning of the twentieth century to recover the reality of the church, yet they also stopped there; they would not go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet the Lord could not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He has gone on to recover the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>So now the first group plus the second group are all opposing the third group.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What will come after the practicality?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe that the Lord will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord will prepare His bride by recovering the local churches, the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Praise the Lord for His recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Praise the Lord for the doctrine, the reality, and the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The practicality of the church life is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God is in Christ, Christ is in the church, and the church is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So to be up to date is to be up to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is God s divine way.</S>
