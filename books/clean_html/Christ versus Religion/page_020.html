<P>Poor Christianity! They do not care if you are withered or alive as long as you keep the regulations. If you keep the "sabbath" with a withered hand, they do not care. But where is the rest? There is no rest for a withered member. The Lord Jesus said in effect, "I do not care for the sabbath; I just care for My members, My fallen sheep." The religious people say, "Look, we are so sound, we are so scriptural, we have everything in order." But the Lord Jesus would say, "I'll have none of it. I only care to heal my members and rescue my sheep." The Lord Jesus did not care for all the regulations. What does it mean to keep the sabbath? Nothing. But to heal a withered hand really means something. To lift the fallen sheep out of the pit really means something. If so many hundreds of people were made alive by being buried, what can you say?</P><P>Some say our meetings are too noisy. They cannot bear our shouting and praising. But look at the fruit. Today, if you go to the so-called Christian churches in America on Sunday morning, it is rather difficult to find many under the age of thirty. They are mostly all old people. But most of us here are under the age of thirty. We have so many young people who have sold themselves for the Lord's recovery. They care for nothing but Christ as the Head and the Church with all the members as the Body. If so, what would you say? Oh, bury the old dead religion! You have been in it for years as a withered member.</P><P>The Lord does not care if people are noisy. A number of times in the Psalms, it says, Make a joyful noise unto God (66:1; 81:1; 95:1, 2; 98:4, 6; 100:1). God is a God of the living, not of the dead. Living ones must be noisy; only the dead ones are quiet. There is no need to command the dead to be quiet; they are quiet because they are dead. Today is not the age of formalities; today is not the age of religion. Today is the age of the living Christ and the living members; not the Christ in teachings and doctrines, but the Christ in life, the Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Look at all these young people who are sold out for Christ and the Church. They will burn the whole country for the Lord.</P><P>The Lord cares for Himself as the Head, and He also cares for all His members. He will cure the withered members, He will rescue the fallen sheep. He will make a living church, not a formal church. Hallelujah, the hungry disciples were fed, and the man with the withered hand found rest, the sheep fallen into the pit was rescued. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." This means negatively that He will take away all the regulations, and positively that He will give us food, healing, rescue, and rest. He is the only way for us to find rest. Rest is not in anything religious; religion burdens us. Christ is our rest. His yoke is gentle, and His burden is light. Why? Because it is a matter of life. Anything of life is so gentle and easy to bear.</P>
