<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-11, 16-19</h1>
<p>We are considering six decades of the Lord&rsquo;s history among us so that we may be enlightened to see the Lord&rsquo;s way, His recovery, and so that we may learn lessons from history. We are also considering the vision that God has revealed to us in the Bible so that we can follow and practice it. We are not following our views, opinions, or feelings. For the past six decades our work has been based on this controlling vision in God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>We are considering this vision for the sake of the younger generation. There are now numerous churches not only in Asia but also on five other continents&mdash;North America, South America (including Central America), Europe, Africa, and Australia (including New Zealand). In some churches over eighty percent of the saints are between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. These saints are either studying in college or working. We want to pass on our history to these saints so that they may see the vision that the Lord has shown us. This vision involves the deep mysteries in the Bible.</p>
<p>There are two mysteries in the Bible. The first mystery is the mystery of God, and the second mystery is the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Our vision is Christ and the church. The Lord has revealed Christ and the church to us; Christ and the church are the greatest mysteries in the Bible. In this chapter we will consider Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF REVELATION IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible is not an ordinary book. Every word in the Bible is God-breathed and is His revelation (2 Tim. 3:16). There are two kinds of revelation in the Bible: revelation on the surface and deep revelation. The deep revelation is a matter of mystery.</p>
<p>When I stand up, others can clearly see that I am an old Chinese man. I have a nose, a mouth, two eyes, and two ears. I am not too tall, nor am I too short. I also have two arms and two legs. However, I have more than outward features; I also have an inner being, which is my mystery. My inner being is my soul&mdash;my mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and my spirit, including my conscience. These inner parts are difficult to understand; they are indescribable. The inner being is the deep mystery within man. This principle also applies to the Bible. There are revelations on the surface, and there are deep mysteries.</p>
<p>The revelation on the surface of the New Testament can be understood by any literate person. According to this revelation, Jesus Christ is the Son of God and was born approximately two thousand years ago in the land of Judea. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. During that time He preached, taught, cast out demons, healed, did many good deeds, and performed many miracles. Finally, He bore the sins of mankind and was crucified on the cross in order to be judged by God on our behalf and to accomplish redemption. He was buried and resurrected after three days. After His resurrection He was with His disciples for forty days and then ascended to the right hand of the Majesty on high to be made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). He is the Lord and the Savior of all men (1 Tim. 4:10). Anyone who is willing to repent, confess his sins, believe in the Lord as the Savior, and accept Him as the Redeemer will be saved&mdash;his sins will be forgiven, and he will be regenerated.</p>
<p>When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in (Rom. 11:25), the Lord will return to judge the world and deal with the devil. Then He will reign on the earth with His overcoming saints for a thousand years (Rev. 20:6). This period of a thousand years is called the millennial kingdom. After a thousand years the Lord Jesus will terminate the entire old creation, renew the heavens and the earth, and bring in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem God will dwell with man in peace and righteousness, and man will enjoy divine blessings for eternity. This is the revelation on the surface of the New Testament. This is the truth in the Bible, and it is the gospel that many missionaries preach all over the world. We thank the Lord for such a revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, the Bible is not so superficial. There are deep mysteries in the Bible. In Ephesians 3:2-11 the word <em>mystery</em> is used three times. A mystery is something hidden, secret, and unfathomable. Anything that is obvious or easy to understand is not a mystery. Hence, the whole universe is a mystery. The more science develops, the more scientists feel that the universe is a mystery. Who can trace the origin of the heavens, the heavenly hosts, and the earth? Who can explore their meaning? The answer to these questions is hidden and not easy to understand.</p>
<p>In addition to the heavens and the earth, man is a mystery. What is man&rsquo;s origin? Who designed man? Why do our nostrils point downward, not upward? Why are our eyebrows above our eyes, not below them? Architects can improve the design of buildings, engineers can produce newer car models, and fashion designers can change the design of clothing, but the human body cannot be improved. If the nose pointed upward, dust and rain would fall into our nostrils, and we would look very ugly. No one can improve the location of our eyes, ears, nose, or mouth; they are just the right size. Our hands look good with four fingers and a thumb; they are capable of doing many things.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of human life? What is the value of human life on the earth? This is a mystery that people do not understand. Nevertheless, God has revealed this mystery in His Word. He wants man to understand this mystery. He also wants this mystery to become our experience and reality so that this mystery would be our life and we would live out this mystery, the church. Therefore, we need to spend time to consider the mystery of God by looking at the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
