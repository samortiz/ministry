   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON NINE HOW TO MEET 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous lesson we covered the importance of meeting, the benefit of meeting, and the result of not meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this lesson we will consider how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although meeting is a spiritual matter, there is still the need of teaching and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many matters related to life require teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Teaching, however, is futile if there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But life without teaching and training will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, in order for us to speak a human language, we need the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we will still be unable to speak any language without learning and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This principle applies to meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person who is not saved cannot meet because he does not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believers have the life of God; this life requires us to meet and gives us the ability to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we still need to learn many techniques related to how to meet in order to be skillful in our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, it is necessary that we be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we consider the condition of our meetings, we realize that thirty years ago we were like children playing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the Lord s mercy was upon us in our childishness and brought us through, we wasted some of our time and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After many years we can now say that we have discovered some ways and secrets concerning how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to meet we must have a seeking heart and a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also need the presence of the Holy Spirit by the Lord s mercy and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are crucial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, we need to carefully consider the techniques of meeting, which are definitely related to ushering in spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must pay attention to all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE PURPOSE OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the purpose of meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is its significance?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The general concept concerning Christian gatherings is that church members sit in a chapel, listen to the preaching of a pastor, and sing some hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this the pastor will stretch out his hands to give a benediction, and everyone goes home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the concept most people have concerning Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we are not speaking of this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our meeting is by no means a so-called Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are four aspects to the purpose of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Toward God Worship</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first aspect of the purpose of meeting is toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This can be summarized as worship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Worshipping God involves four points.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Singing</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to sing hymns in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once a person is saved, he needs to learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may have learned music in school and, therefore, have some knowledge concerning singing; this is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But even with this knowledge concerning singing, we still need to adjust our attitude when we sing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whereas we learned to appreciate music artistically, now we should sing hymns with a heart to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers and sisters who have not learned music need to learn a little concerning music.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, sometimes it is necessary to teach the brothers and sisters before or after the meetings how to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Singing hymns is closely related to meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the singing is poor, our spirit often cannot be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the singing is good, our spirit will be easily uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes a hymn is begun in a key that is too high for people to follow; at other times the key is so low that it is difficult for people to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes the singing is so fast that it is difficult for people to keep up; at other times it is so slow that it puts people to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This requires our attention and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praising</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to praise God in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We praise God with prayers, not with hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Good praises are often needed in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not petitioning, asking, begging, or even thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is praising God mainly for His doings and His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should read the words of praise in the Bible and apply them frequently in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thanking</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the meeting we also need to give thanks to God for His grace and for the works of grace He accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whereas the objects of our praise are God s doings and His virtues, the objects of our thanksgiving are God s grace and His works of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Meditating</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We also need quiet moments to meditate during the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In particular this applies to the bread-breaking meeting; the brothers and sisters should exercise to be calm and consider the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even the prayer meeting needs this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brothers and sisters should always consider the Lord quietly before a meeting begins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not talk and disturb the spirit of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This requires much exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need a kind of contemplation to consider the Lord and His doings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These four points constitute our worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the meetings we should sing hymns to God, offer prayers of praise to God for His doing and His virtues, and thank Him for His grace and works of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We also need to be calm before God to consider His person and His doings.</S>
