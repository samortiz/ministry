   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFERENT HYMNS TO BE USED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the entire course of a meeting we need different hymns for different sections of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, we may have ten kinds of hymns to meet the need of different sections of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first hymn should be an opening hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the opening hymn we should lead the saints into the subject of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the second hymn should be an introductory hymn that brings the entire meeting to its central subject.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes, if there may not have been a strong release of the spirit of a hymn, there is the need for a third kind of hymn, a strengthening hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At such a time we need to strengthen the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if the strengthening hymn is not sufficient, we will need a fourth kind of hymn that can uplift the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, a hymn for uplifting the spirit does not necessarily have to follow a strengthening hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A fifth kind of hymn is a turning hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When someone selects the wrong hymn and the singing begins to drag, there is the need to turn by selecting another hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, in a meeting where everyone senses the Lord s greatness and exaltedness, a brother may select a gospel hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At such a time there is the need for someone to select another hymn immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sixth kind of hymn, similar to a turning hymn, is a correcting hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, someone may select a hymn about praising the Lord after the bread and cup have been passed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At this time someone should correct this choice by selecting a hymn related to the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A seventh kind of hymn maintains the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the meeting has not reached its conclusion, there is the need to maintain the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An eighth kind of hymn fills the gap and adjusts the length of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes if the meeting is too long and needs some adjustment, someone can adjust it with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ninth kind of hymn is a concluding hymn, and the tenth kind of hymn is a lingering hymn, a hymn for lingering before sending people off.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes a meeting has ended, yet it seems that the meeting is still not over; at such times there is the need for a sending off hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is based on Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Abraham was reluctant to let Jehovah go, he walked a distance with Him to send Him off v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An opening hymn serves two purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, it calms the saints hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often our hearts are not settled when we walk into a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The singing of a hymn can calm our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, an opening hymn allows time for all the saints to arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second hymn should bring the saints hearts into the central subject of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In short, because the first hymn is for the preparation of the saints hearts, the singing should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we should not go too high too fast; rather, we should sing verse by verse to calm the saints hearts so that they may be brought into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, no matter what kind of meeting we are in, we can select a longer hymn for the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second hymn brings the saints into the central subject of a meeting, leading them into the spirit of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose in a prayer meeting we sense that the atmosphere is for the spreading of the gospel; we should not select a hymn that does not have the flavor of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though a hymn of encouragement can be used in ministering the Word or in encouraging the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, it is not appropriate in a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, if we select the wrong hymn, it will be difficult to go on in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are not familiar with the hymns and expect to be inspired by the Holy Spirit, we are waiting for a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, a knowledge of the hymns and the selection of hymns are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An opening hymn should be long enough for the spirit of the saints to be fanned into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a hymn is not long enough, the saints will not be sufficiently pumped up in their spirit; they will be like those who are out of breath when they run home from the street and go directly to the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order for the opening hymn to stir up and uplift the spirit of the saints, the tune must be powerful, and it must be easy to sing; moreover, the lyrics should be of adequate length.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For instance, Hymns, #213 is a good hymn for beginning the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If all the brothers and sisters sense that the Lord is full of glory and honor, then they can sing Hymns, #127, and continue with Hymns, #183.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To do this, however, we must have some spiritual skill, and the spirit of the meeting must also be able to keep pace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, as a rule, after singing Hymns, #127, we will not be able to find another hymn as a continuation because the singing has already reached the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason we might need to reserve Hymns, #127 for later and sing Hymns, #183 first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if we are experienced in spirit and realize that even though Hymns, #127 is high, it cannot fully express our inner feeling; then perhaps we can continue with Hymns, #141.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In such an uplifted spirit we can break the bread to remember the Lord, singing, Jesus, Thy head, once crown d with thorns, / Is crown d with glory now; / Heaven s royal diadem adorns / The mighty Victor s brow stanza 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we all remember the Lord in this way, the brothers and sisters will receive an unimaginable supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that the responsible brothers in the various localities will bring this matter to the Lord and learn to put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, although we may give people food in our meetings, we may cause them to have indigestion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Meetings are for the edification of the saints, but if we do not know how to meet in a proper way, we will not only fail to edify the saints but also ruin their spiritual appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we begin a meeting with Hymns, #183, continue with Hymns, #127, follow with an uplifted blessing, and then go on to Hymns, #141, the saints will surely feel comfortable and receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>SEVERAL MATTERS THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to be serious and familiarize ourselves with the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should even memorize some of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The leading brothers, in particular, must spend time in this matter; otherwise, their work will be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some of the leading brothers may say that they have a blueprint in their hand, yet after a while what they are attempting to carry out may become dead and full of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If so, there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to have a careful consideration concerning the blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes a blueprint may not be entirely accurate, so it is best that the brothers do not design a blueprint by themselves; rather, they should do it in coordination with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if we have a correct blueprint, however, our way and method may not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes we lead the saints to consecrate themselves and to begin with their spirit, but we have not led them to deal with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Holy Spirit never works together with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, if we work by the flesh, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must all learn this lesson: once we touch the Lord s work, we must learn to reject and deal with our flesh.</S>
