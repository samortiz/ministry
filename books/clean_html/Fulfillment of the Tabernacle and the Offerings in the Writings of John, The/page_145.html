<h2 class=head2>As the Spirit Coming to Enter into the Believers</h2><p>As the Spirit Christ enters into the believers (John 14:17-18, 20; 17:26b; 15:4a, 5a). This means that Christ not only comes to us—He enters into us. Christ can come into us because He is pneumatic. We simply need to breathe Him in as the divine pneuma. We know from experience that even when we are not aware of it, the heavenly air enters into us.<h2 class=head2>To Impart the Divine Life into the Believers</h2><p>In resurrection Christ imparts the divine life into the believers (John 3:15-16; 10:10b). Through His death the divine life was released. Now this life is imparted to our being by the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. The redeeming Christ is now the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, and this pneumatic Christ enters into us to impart the divine life to us. By this we see that the divine life has been imparted to our being not only through the Lord’s death but also through His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>To Live in and with the Believers</h2><p>As the Spirit in resurrection, Christ lives in and with the believers (John 14:19; 6:57; Gal. 2:20). This means that He becomes one with us. He and we have one life. Because of His resurrection, we and the Lord have one life, and we live together with Him.<h2 class=head2>To Bring the Believers into the Father, That Where He Is They Also May Be</h2><p>In resurrection Christ brings the believers into the Father so that where He is they also may be (John 14:10a, 11a, 3, 20; 17:21, 24). This is to be in the Father’s house. Through Christ’s death and resurrection, through His going and coming, we have entered into the Father’s house.<p>We have not only entered into the Father’s house, but we have even become part of the Father’s house. John 14:23 says, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” The abode here is one of the many abodes mentioned in verse 2, where the Lord says, “In my Father’s house are many abodes.” The Lord’s word here indicates that the believers become abodes in the Father’s house.<p>Today we all are part of the church life, part of the Father’s house, through Christ’s death and resurrection and in the pneumatic Christ, who now lives within us. The pneumatic Christ makes us one with the Triune God, and this oneness is the Father’s house. This is the Body of Christ, which is an organism of the Triune God.<p>This marvelous organism is infinitely better than a so-called heavenly mansion. Such a mansion would not be pneumatic. But today’s church is pneumatic. The church is an organism full of pneuma. Instead of looking forward to a heavenly mansion, I prefer to remain in the church enjoying the pneumatic Christ.
