<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(52)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 3, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER O. J.</h2><p>I heard the story of Christ and His cross and was moved to believe in the Lord. When I attended a revival meeting in Canton, I experienced a great change and saw the importance of saving souls. I quit my job as a teacher and accepted the invitation of a denomination to be their woman preacher. At one point I felt uneasy in the denomination where I was, and I left. In April of this year, two brothers introduced me to Brother Nee and allowed me to come to the training. The training makes me realize that the standard is very high. I am afraid that I will not be able to meet the standard, and I am somewhat discouraged. Yet I do not want to return empty-handed. Once, I heard the story of Absalom and was touched to commit myself to the Lord. I subsequently was revived in soul and body. My locality does not have any co-worker or local church. May the Lord send someone there to build up the church.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister has one merit: She is more disciplined in her character than most young people. A young person can boast of knowledge and gift, but he cannot boast of the character that is formed in him. After we live with a person for a long time, we spontaneously pick up the idiomatic expressions and gestures of that person. Similarly, if a man yields to the Lord, he will be conformed to the Lord in godliness. He will be like Him in character, and he will be built up in his disposition. A young person cannot match an older one in character. Many young people are raw, hard, bitter, and caustic in their disposition. I hope that the shining of God's great light will yield greater results, not merely general results in your character. Suppose a man waits for heavy rainfall to come yet only has a small cup or spoon to contain it. Would that not be a joke? The same can be said of spiritual things. When God wants to give to man, man should open his mouth wide. He should stretch his capacity for God's dispensing. As the Holy Spirit works, every vessel should be full. We should ask God to increase our capacity so that we can be fed and our thirst fully quenched. When God grants us grace, we experience wonderful days. But unless God grants us grace, it is not easy for us to receive anything. Therefore, when God gives, we should increase our capacity to receive. He will fill us. We should be like the woman in 2 Kings 4, who went out to borrow more empty vessels. All the vessels she borrowed were filled. When she stopped borrowing, God stopped filling. Only then did God's oil cease. We can tell the Lord, "Give me what I need today, and even give me what I do not need today. Give me what I can take today, and even give me what I cannot take today. Give me what I can understand today, and even give me what I cannot understand today. Give me everything." This is the principle of borrowing vessels. God will fill us beyond our own measure. The Lord's word will create the need and satisfy us. His word is full of light and will produce an earnest desire in man. Chinese produce goods only when there is a demand for them. But Americans produce goods first and then create a market by demonstrating their usefulness. We should not pray according to man's need, but according to God's riches. We should ask for things that we do not know. This is the meaning of increasing our capacity.</p><p>In working for the Lord, a worker has to learn to diagnose man's condition with his spirit. Some people only need to speak five minutes, and we know whether or not they are even a Christian. Once we have the experience of salvation, we know how to discern the genuineness of salvation in others. It is useless for a doctor merely to prescribe medicine to others. He must know a patient's sickness and find the cause of this sickness before he can write the prescription. You have to start learning while you are in the training here on the mountain. After you leave the mountain, you have to exercise your observation, pray and consider before the Lord, and listen more to God's speaking in you. If you do this, you will have a good knowledge and a firm understanding of men in another ten years. But unless you practice this, you will not be able to know men even after ten years. The knowledge of men does not come as an accident. Some people know men by exercising their natural discernment. This is not how we know men. If we try to know men by exercising our natural discernment, we will suffer great loss. We have no intention of minding other people's business or of criticizing them. For the sake of helping them, however, we have to learn to know them. We are not here to gossip. A doctor does not seek to know a sickness for the purpose of talking about it. He speaks of it for the purpose of curing it. The work of a doctor is to discern, not to criticize, to heal, not to nitpick. May the Lord help us to learn our lessons first. Then we will know men and be able to help solve their problems.</p>
