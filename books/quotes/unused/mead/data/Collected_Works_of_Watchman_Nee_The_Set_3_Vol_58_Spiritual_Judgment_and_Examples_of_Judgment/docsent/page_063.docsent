   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 43 Date:August 23, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My father was an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was seventeen I saw a demon being cast out of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was touched by the Lord's authority and believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Four years ago I became sick and vomited blood profusely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through prayer I was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1933 Brother Nee conducted a special conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The subject of the messages was Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the victorious Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I received much help from these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I also received much help from Ministering to the House or to God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord wanted me to consecrate everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My wife was not of the same mind, and I gradually became more lax.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two things happened last year which took away all of our money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I became very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once our house caught on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord heard my prayer; He changed the direction of the wind and sent rain to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was spared from death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I asked my wife, "I could have died from this fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How many husbands do you have to spare?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You and I and our whole family have to hand ourselves over to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later I went to Foochow and handed myself over.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our brother's course has been quite straight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has been merciful to him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet God's children should not pray for outward grace all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should learn to receive inward grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The grace we receive from the Lord outwardly should not exceed the lessons we learn inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should, of course, thank the Lord for the outward grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if our flesh is never dealt with, we will still be strong and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord healed ten lepers, but only one came back to thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn to pick up the inward lessons even when there is no outward blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes we know the Lord more when He does not answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, we should not go to extremes like the ascetics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can thank the Lord for His outward grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we should not force God to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can ask God for outward grace, but we should not force Him to do what He does not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once I was talking to Sister M. E. Barber in the living room, and two sisters were praying in the back room.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One of them was quite forceful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Miss Barber asked, "Should you pray like she does?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before I could answer her, she said, "You should never pray like she does.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can never force God to answer your prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a man is desperate, he wants to force God to do what He does not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The spiritual condition of God's children involves a balance between the inward and the outward.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there are many outward experiences with very few inward experiences, it means that there is very little inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must always maintain a balance between the outward and the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fundamental exercise for a Christian is to pick up the inward lessons first.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a man is under God's mercy, he will experience outward grace frequently, and this grace is indeed necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if a man has not learned the inward lessons, no outward grace will profit him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Israelites experienced much outward grace, but they did not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one witnessed as many outward miracles as the Israelites, yet no one rebelled against God as much either.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same principle, the church in Corinth received much outward knowledge and many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Outwardly speaking, it could have been the most blessed church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet it lacked inward grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Corinthians did not learn the lessons inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the reason Paul said that they had become kings, while he with the other apostles were still among the least 1 Cor 4:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must turn inward for our lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe our brother has maintained an inward knowledge of the Lord all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When an incident arises, we have to see what God is doing and what lesson we have to learn from it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our brother's spirit has everything to do with the way he took in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When one speaks, we have to notice whether or not his spirit is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first half of his testimony was weak in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His spirit became a little stronger in the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our brother should have wounds in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, others will only hear his words but not touch his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In serving the Lord a worker should learn to have a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Old Testament we find the expression a contrite spirit, that is, a spirit that is broken and not whole.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can call it a "scarred spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After a man is smitten by God, he will become broken; he no longer can be whole again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It will be easy for him to prostrate himself and for his spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The worst thing that can happen to a worker is to have a whole spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After a man is smitten, he will not be able to lift up his head again; he will no longer be whole.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is a difference between brokenness and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brokenness is a matter of taste, while strength is a matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A broken spirit is a stricken spirit; it has to do with taste.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After a father or mother disciplines his or her children severely, the children behave differently.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although they still eat, work, listen, and speak, the flavor is different; they now have a disciplined spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Spontaneously, they are no longer nonchalant or careless; there is not the need for them to consciously check themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A disciplined spirit spontaneously cultivates a fear for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is not a performance but a restriction that comes naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Such a person can easily prostrate himself, and he is always pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who have never been disciplined do not know what this taste is like.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As I was listening to our brother's testimony, I felt that his spirit was released yet the wound was not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I hope that there will be more wounds in our brother so that he will not be able to stand up again before God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The increase of wounds always facilitates the outflow of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once the spirit flows out, it is easy to touch others and approach them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some people remain at a distance from others' lives; their words can never reach others' hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the spirit is broken, not only are words released but the words are released through the spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although our brother has deeper wounds than other brothers and sisters, these wounds are not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our wounds should be as deep as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The more wounds we have and the deeper they are, the easier it is for our spirit to be released.</S>
