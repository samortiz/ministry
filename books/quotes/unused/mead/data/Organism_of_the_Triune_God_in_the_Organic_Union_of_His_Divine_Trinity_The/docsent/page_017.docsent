   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ORGANIC PROCESSES IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EXPERIENCED BY THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 5:25a; Rom 8:2a; Gal 5:16a, 25b; Rom 8:4b; Eph 3:16-17a; Phil 1:19; Titus 3:5b; Rom 15:16; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rev 4:5; 5:6; 2 Cor 13:14; 1 Cor 6:17; Rev 22:17a</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapter, we saw nine of the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we want to see ten more of these organic processes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>LIVING BY THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last item that we saw in the previous chapter was that we need to be led by the Spirit of the divine sonship Rom 8:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are under the leading of the indwelling Spirit, we will live a life that is the life of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not live a life of a son of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to live a life according to the leading of the Spirit of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we are living by the Spirit of life Gal 5:25a; Rom 8:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To live by the Spirit of life means to live by taking Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that he had been crucified with Christ and that it was no longer he who lived but Christ lived in him Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul realized that he had been terminated and that Christ, realized as the Spirit, was living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to ask ourselves who is living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are we living or is He living?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians are still under the direction of human ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Human beings should be ethical, but we Christians should not be under the direction of human ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have Someone much higher than ethics directing us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This higher One is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This One as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to allow Him to live Himself through us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a husband loves his wife, is he loving or is the consummated Triune God loving?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of how good something is that we do, if the consummated Triune God is not doing it through us, it is not acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want human ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants to live through us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wants us to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to give the Lord a way to do everything through us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Paul, it is no longer I who live Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have been crucified with Christ, we are terminated, finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I speak, it should be no longer I but Christ who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to live a life that is not of ourselves but a life of taking Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>WALKING BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also need to walk by the mingled spirit Gal 5:16a, 25b; Rom 8:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may say that living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But there is still a little difference between living and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live by the Spirit is general, whereas to walk by the Spirit is more particular and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Galatians 5:16 and 25 plus Romans 8:4 use the word walk, but Greek has two words for walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:4 use a general word for walk, whereas Galatians 5:25 uses a particular word that means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk in regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 8:4 says that we should not walk according to flesh but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spirit here and in Galatians 5:16 and 25 refers to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to walk according to our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have confessed many times that I did not walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I may have said something good to my wife, but it was a good word that was not according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It may have been a word only according to my mind or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we may not admit it, we mostly care for ethics, for what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not have a thorough care for our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may speak a good word, but do we speak it according to our spirit or according to our mind or emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we speak may seem spiritual, heavenly, and divine, but as long as we do not speak it according to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, we are condemned in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may be highly appraised by others, but we are condemned by our spirit with its conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our spirit justifies only what is done according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After reading this fellowship, we may wonder who is able to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to be able.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to apply Paul s word in Philippians 4:13 I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can do everything in the One, Christ, who strengthens and empowers us, and this One is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we speak something in our mind, this One will not strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes as I was about to speak a good word to someone, the dear One within me pulled me back, not allowing me to speak what I wanted to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have to learn to walk according to our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the real practice of the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The organic union includes us and the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we must live in Him and by Him as a divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must also live with Him as the Regulator.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not be regulated by what is good or bad but by the indwelling Spirit mingled with our spirit.</S>
