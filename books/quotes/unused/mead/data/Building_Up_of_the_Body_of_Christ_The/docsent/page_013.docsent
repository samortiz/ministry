   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO LONGER BABES TOSSED BY WAVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:14 continues with the result of our reaching this goal: That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul used the phrase that we may be, indicating that he included himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even Paul himself had the possibility of being a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we be so confident that we are no longer babes?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are tossed by waves, this is a sign that we are babes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A babe is unsteady and easily shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tossed by waves indicates that the church life with all the saints is sailing on the stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every sea has waves and storms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is sailing like a boat on the sea, and the sea has many storms.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been in the church life for over fifty years, and I was with Brother Nee for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout these years in all the places that I have been, I have seen storm after storm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I began to see these storms, I had some doubts about the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among all the churches that have been raised up through my ministry there were always storms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I realized that according to Paul s Epistles, there were not any good churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the churches were as good as we imagine, Paul would not have needed to write his Epistles to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His Epistles were written to churches with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was young, I heard someone say that the church in Philippi was the best church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first chapter of Philippians talks about the bountiful supply of the Spirit for magnifying and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the second chapter Paul charges them to do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that among the Philippians there were murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I considered the situation among the churches recorded in the New Testament, I was comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even among the churches that Paul raised up, there were problems and storms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I could not expect to do better than he did.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No sea can avoid the storms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are sailing on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At one time the weather may be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suddenly a storm, a problem, arises.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a storm comes, would you be tossed by the waves?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you would, this is a strong indication that you are babyish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CARRIED ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The stormy sea is stirred up by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The goal of the wind is to carry us away from God s central purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul says that we can be carried about by winds of different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus and charge certain ones not to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By that time, Ephesus was an established church with elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This can be proven by Acts 20 which tells us that Paul sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church there v. 17 . Paul s calling for the elders and his fellowship with them proves that once the elders had been established, the apostle still had the position to charge them to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul charged, warned, and advised them to shepherd the flock because wolves would come in among them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later he asked his co-worker, a young apostle, to remain in Ephesus where elders had already been established, to charge certain ones not to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Timothy 1:3 and 4 indicate that these teachings were different from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To teach anything other than God s New Testament economy is to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul would not allow different teachings to be taught within the limit of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He would not allow anything to be taught that was different from God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Three major categories of heretical things invaded the early church to distract the saints from God s economy: Judaism, Gnosticism, and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These three major items are dealt with in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Galatians, Judaism was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Colossians, Paul deals with Gnosticism and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These three items were troubling the saints and distracting them from God s New Testament economy, which centers on Christ and His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today there are many different teachings distracting the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The winds of different teachings are teachings that deviate from the all-inclusive person and the full redemptive work of Christ and from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any teaching that would cause us to deviate from Christ s redemption and His wonderful person and from the church should be considered as a teaching different from God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These different teachings are in the sleight of men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sleight indicates a deceiving method.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word in Greek signifies the cheating of dice players.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The different teachings are used by the evil one, Satan, through man s deceiving method.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These teachings are in the deceiving doctrines instigated by Satan in his subtlety with the sleight of men to frustrate God s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ in the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to check whether what we hear is making us alive to grow in life or deadening us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Anything that makes us alive to grow in life is organic and is something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Anything we hear or read that deadens our spirit is something satanic in the sleight of men to carry us away so that God s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ is frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These winds of teaching are also in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sleight is a deceiving method.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Craftiness is a subtle activity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The different teachings are of a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may feel that these teachings happen only occasionally, but in actuality they take place according to a satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Satan has systematized the crafty, dividing teachings, causing errors that damage the practical oneness of the Body life.</S>
