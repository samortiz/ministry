        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FOURTH FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE LINE OF LIFE IN THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>This series of messages is not a verse-by-verse study like an ordinary Bible-study. On the contrary, we want to see the line pertaining to life in the Word of God. Apart from the line of life, there are many other significant points in Genesis, such as the ark in chapters 6 through 8. Even so, we must emphasize that our intention is not to study Genesis in order to identify every item of truth in it. Rather, our intention is to see the line of life.</p>
<p>Our burden is also not to expound the Bible but to speak concerning life. Bible exposition alone is for the increase of human knowledge, but the line of life is for man to know God. Our desire is not merely to help the children of God to increase their biblical knowledge. Instead, our earnest hope is that we can see the way pertaining to God&rsquo;s life in the Word of God. Therefore, instead of merely studying with our mind, we should open our spirit and be willing to see the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s life and to know the way of God&rsquo;s life. This is not a matter pertaining to knowledge but a matter pertaining to life.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden there were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The issue of touching the tree of life is life, whereas the issue of touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. All biblical truths include a certain amount of knowledge, but our speaking will be a failure if we cause people only to gain knowledge rather than touch the life of God.</p>
<p>In John 6:63 the Lord clearly said that the words He spoke are spirit and life. I hope that when we study the Lord&rsquo;s Word, our spirit will touch the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s life. Therefore, when we study, we should not come to comprehend only with our mind, but even more we need to have a heart and a spirit to touch God and contact His Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION, MAN&rsquo;S FALL, AND GOD&rsquo;S CALLING</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fourth fall of man. In brief, man&rsquo;s first fall was in the garden of Eden (Gen. 3), the second fall was with Cain (ch. 4), and the third fall was before the deluge (ch. 6). Man&rsquo;s fall involved more than one step. Once man began to fall, he fell step after step. Once man fell, he continued to fall. The first fall in the garden of Eden was the beginning, the first step, of the fall of mankind. After that step, there was a second step. After the second step, there was a third step, and after the third step, there was a fourth step. After the fourth step, man had fallen to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Genesis is divided into three major sections: the first section is on God&rsquo;s creation (chs. 1&mdash;2), the second section is on man&rsquo;s fall (3:1&mdash;11:9), and the third section is on God&rsquo;s calling (11:10&mdash;50). We have already seen God&rsquo;s creation in previous messages (see <em>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God&rsquo;s Desire and Purpose in Creation)</em>. In regard to man&rsquo;s fall, there is a total of four steps, which constitute man&rsquo;s complete fall; therefore, we refer to them as the four falls of man. The first fall in the garden of Eden was like man&rsquo;s enrollment in a &ldquo;school of falling,&rdquo; whereas his fourth fall was like his graduation from this school. Adam&rsquo;s fall was merely the beginning of the fall. It was not until the fourth step of the fall that the fall of the entire human race was complete.</p>
<p>The Adamic race became incurable and hopeless in God&rsquo;s eyes because of these continuing falls, and God had no choice but to give up on the Adamic race, that is, to give up on the human race. This does not mean, however, that God had no further work with mankind. Instead, God had a new beginning. God&rsquo;s first beginning was His creation of man. After created man fell to the uttermost, God had a new beginning by coming to call man. The man whom He called was Abraham. The record in the Bible from Genesis 11:10 to the end of Revelation is not a record of the Adamic race. God gave up on the Adamic race because of its repeated falls, but after man fell to the uttermost, God called Abraham and his descendants, that is, the Abrahamic race. After Genesis 11:10 the Bible covers the Abrahamic race. The remainder of the Old Testament covers Abraham&rsquo;s earthly descendants, and the entirety of the New Testament covers Abraham&rsquo;s heavenly descendants. Every Gentile believer in the Lord has become a son of Abraham through faith (Gal. 3:7, 29). Therefore, the emphasis from Genesis 11:10 to the end of the New Testament is altogether on the Abrahamic race, the called race.</p>
<p>Hebrews 3:1 says that we, the saved ones, are &ldquo;partakers of a heavenly calling.&rdquo; As saved ones, we are God&rsquo;s called ones. The first section of the Bible covers the created race, the Adamic race; the second section covers the called race, the Abrahamic race.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
