Verses 15-31 refer to the things during the end time. So between "the end" in verse 6 and verse 15, approximately nineteen hundred years have passed. During these nineteen hundred years, God has not acknowledged the position of the Jews. But in the future the situation will be restored to that which existed when the Lord was on the earth. The Sabbath, the offerings, the temple, etc. will all be restored.</P><P>Verses 7-8 are a small section describing the situation on the whole earth during the nineteen hundred years. In verse 7 after the word "famines" there should be the word "pestilences." The events of verses 7 and 8 will be more obvious and more numerous before the end of the age. Now in this age they have already increased, so we know that we are at the beginning of the end of the age.</P><P>During the European War [World War I], ten million people died, and countless wealth and property were lost. Today the small wars happening in various places cause more damage than the European War. In this world there is not one day of peace. In Russia five million people have starved to death. During the flood in China the year before last, eighty million people starved to death. In America, while there are plenty of agricultural products, the cost of harvesting is more than the price of the harvest itself. Last year in our country the bumper crop caused the price of rice to be so low that the farmers suffered greatly. In South America pestilences killed six million people within twelve weeks. In India five million died at one time in an earthquake. In 1923 the big earthquake in Japan affected Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. It was over within a few hours-two out of every ten thousand people died. In 1927 there was a big earthquake in Kansu Province in China. Two out of every thousand died. In July 1927 there was an earthquake in Jerusalem. On the average there are three or four earthquakes every day. Let us consider these things with spiritual eyesight. Today peace is abnormal, while war is commonplace. In the past it was more "kingdom against kingdom"; today it is more "people against people."</P><P>What is recorded in Matthew 24:7-8 is somewhat similar to what will happen during the first four seals mentioned in Revelation 6. The white horse in Revelation 6:2 may refer to the false Christ in Matthew 24:5. The red horse in Revelation 6:4 in the second seal is the war in Matthew. Red is the color of blood, while the sword supplants peace; the red horse has already come to the earth. The black horse in the third seal in Revelation 6:5-6 refers to famine. Man's skin turns black during a famine (Lam. 5:10). The balance refers to the time when material goods become very expensive, when one cannot be wrong by even a denarius-one day's wage (Matt. 20:2). Although one denarius buys a choenix of wheat, that is not enough to sustain one family. Oil and wine become items of luxury and cannot be wasted. In Revelation 6:7-8 the pale horse (green according to the original text) in the fourth seal refers to those who die of the plague and who have turned pale green. Hades is the place where dead people go. "Hades followed" means that Hades picks up and collects all those dead ones who have died of the plague. It is like the dust pan that follows the broom. During the sixth seal in Revelation 6:12 there is a great earthquake. There are five mentions of earthquakes in Revelation. But actually there are only three, and all of these are close to Jerusalem. But Matthew also says "earthquakes in various places."</P><P>Verse 7:"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places." In conclusion, there are four calamities: (1) war, (2) famine, (3) plagues, and (4) earthquakes. All these four are the birth pangs. All those who give birth are in pain at the beginning, but afterward they rejoice. For the Jews to enjoy the joy of the kingdom on the earth, they must first pass through the birth pangs. All those who have the eyesight will say that the end of the age has come. War, famine, plagues, and earthquakes are merely the birth pangs. Here the woman is Jerusalem, which represents the Jews, and the child to be delivered refers to the overcomers. In Psalm 48:6 the birth pangs refer to the Gentiles. First Thessalonians 5:3 also refers to the Gentiles: "When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child."</P><P>Verse 8:"All these things are the beginning of birth pangs." Although these four things are the birth pangs, they are merely the beginning of birth pangs. More serious things are coming.</P><P>Verse 9:"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name." This is the real beginning of the tribulation. Verses 9-13 are another small section, which deals with persecution. The "you" in verse 9 refers to the Jewish disciples. Recently, in northern Europe such kinds of Jewish believers were discovered. They keep the commandments and the Sabbath, and they believe that the Lord is the Messiah. They are the prophets mentioned in Matthew 23:34. These kinds of prophets and wise men will be persecuted and even killed (James 5:6). This is recorded in more detail in Mark and Luke. These Jewish believers will be delivered to the synagogues, and the Holy Spirit will speak for them. Mark 13, Luke 21, and Matthew 24 all speak of the Jewish believers. These are the same disciples as those going to "the house of Israel" in Matthew 10. Luke 22:35-38 refers to the Gentile disciples. By the time of Luke 22, the age of grace had begun; this is why He sent the disciples to the Gentiles, and this is why they had to take money and other material things. Hence, the prophecy on the mountain is the same as Matthew 10:5-6. Compare (1) Matthew 23:34 with 10:17-18; (2) Luke 21:14 with Matthew 10:19-20; (3) Matthew 24:9-10 with Luke 21:16-17 and Matthew 10:21-22; and (4) Matthew 24:13 with Matthew 10:22. All these verses refer to the Jewish disciples, the synagogue, the assembly, etc. All these have a Jewish color.</P><P>The "nations" are the unbelieving Gentiles. From this we know that "you" refers to the Jewish believers. Isaiah 49:9-10 prophesies that the Jews in the future will preach the gospel and will be zealous for the Lord. In the fifth seal in Revelation, those who were slain were calling out for vengeance, and the Lord comforted them and charged them to wait until the number of those brothers who are to be killed would be fulfilled. Therefore, the brothers who are being killed in Revelation 6 are the Jewish disciples in Matthew 24:9.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 89</div><br></body></html>
