   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Their Forsaking Jehovah Their God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being an Evil and Bitter Thing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was an evil and bitter thing that the people of Israel had forsaken Jehovah their God v. 19 . They forsook Him, the fountain of living waters, and went away from Him to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. Being like Jehovah's Wife</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Committing Fornication with Many Lovers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Finally, in forsaking Jehovah, the fountain of living waters, God's people were like Jehovah's wife committing fornication with many lovers 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Israel realized that Jehovah was her Husband, but she continued to commit fornication with many lovers, with many idols.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such was the sinful condition of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>HEWING OUT FOR THEMSELVES CISTERNS,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BROKEN CISTERNS, WHICH HOLD NO WATER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Israel forsook Jehovah as the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was Israel's first evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Israel's second evil was to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, which hold no water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Toiling to Make Broken and Waterless Cisterns</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to Replace the Fountain of Living Waters</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word in 2:13 about cisterns is, of course, a figure of speech portraying Israel's toil in making something to replace God as the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To hew out a cistern from rock is very hard labor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the cistern may become broken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once a cistern is broken, the water in it leaks out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a picture of human labor and enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may labor to get something for ourselves, but then our "cistern" develops a crack, and we lose whatever we have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Choosing Many Idols</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to Replace the Unique God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Israel chose many idols, which are of no benefit, to replace the unique God, who is their glory 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is very similar to what is described in Romans 1:23, where Paul speaks of those who "changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles."</S>
