I took my family and walked from Han-Dao to Tzi-Li. All the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha are scattered. Some have moved to the countryside. Only Brother Ji Dun-wu and his family are still living in the Bible school. There are still two sisters in the orphanage.

Therefore, we have not published The Dynamics of Service in order to reduce the number of pages. In some places, we cannot send the magazine in bulk quantity; we have therefore forwarded only one copy.</p><p>(2) Brother Watchman Nee has to proofread the book Rethinking Our Work in England. He has been delayed in his return schedule. Many places have written to ask about his return date, and this serves to answer all of them.</p><p>(3) The brothers and sisters in northern Kiangsu are all safe, according to a report on April 13. However, the mail routes are still blocked. We ask that the Lord open a way for those who are in need.</p><p>(4) Some letters that have been directed to us do not have names written in a clear way. It is difficult for us publish their addresses because we do not know them, and we cannot write in a name for them.</p><p>(5) We hope that the places that are close to the war zone will report to us on the whereabouts of the brothers and sisters so that we can publish them in this magazine to relieve the concern of the saints in various places.</p><p>(6) Brother Ge Shien-shen in Chungking cabled us, and Brother Yu Yun-fei wrote from Ning-Po. The saints in both places are safe.
