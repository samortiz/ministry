<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Reign in the Divine Life</H2><P>When we are saved in the divine life by being released, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and transfigured, we can reign in the divine life (Rom. 5:17). The more we live and are saved in the divine life, the more kingship we exercise and the more we reign in the divine life. The divine life is kingly and royal. The overcomers will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6) because they will be saturated and swallowed up by the divine life. Because they are full of life, they become the embodiment of life, and they will also have the kingship in full. They reign because they are full of life. The matter of reigning in the divine life is referred to by John (Rev. 20:4, 6) and is also one of the particular items stressed in Paul's writings (Rom. 5:17; 2 Tim. 2:12).</P><P>We rule as kings over sin, the world, Satan, the natural man, the self, and individualism for the accomplishing of the building up of the organic Body of Christ in fulfilling the New Testament economy of God, by the receiving of the abundance of grace through Christ. As one who has been laboring for the Lord for many years, I have discovered that the hardest thing to do is to build up the Body of Christ. In order to build up the Body, we must overcome sin, the world, Satan, our natural man, the self, and individualism by the divine life. When we are such persons, the Lord will then have a way through us to build up His organic Body. This building will fulfill the New Testament economy of God.</P><P>By receiving the abundance of grace, we reign in life (Rom. 5:17). Grace is the divine life for our experience and enjoyment. The abundance of grace is just the abundance of the riches of the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Resulting in the Victory over Satan</H2><P>The result of all the items by which we are saved in the divine life is the victory over Satan (Rom. 16:20). Satan will be crushed under our feet. Satan is crushed, and we have God as our peace and Christ as our grace. We have such a life in which we enjoy the peace of God which is God Himself and the grace of the Lord which is the Lord Himself.</P>
