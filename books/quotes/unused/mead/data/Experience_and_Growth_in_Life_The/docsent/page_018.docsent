   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Is trying to set our mind on our spirit an example of trying to do good?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: In my youth I heard a saying, "To know sin is to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before Adam and Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were innocent; there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After they took the fruit, their eyes were opened, and they began to know good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To try to do good is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, to try to set our mind on the spirit is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simply set your mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul did not charge us to try to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He simply said, "The mind set on the spirit is life and peace" Rom 8:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After hearing a message on setting the mind on the spirit, some may resolve to do their best to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to stop our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we try to overcome, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Faith is not doing or trying; faith is simply believing what God has said and saying "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This faith keeps us in rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Question: How do you apply the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Answer: To apply the law of life may also be our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not consider how to apply the law of the Spirit of life or how to stop the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have seen the law of the Spirit of life, simply say, "Hallelujah, Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law of the Spirit of life will work by itself; it does not need you to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith stops any kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It stops you from trying and doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not know how the Lord will do it, but we do believe that He will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: What is a practical example of setting our mind on the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: To define the way to set our mind on the spirit is to yield to a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul did not charge us by saying, "Set your mind on the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to make up our mind to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith stops our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith always praises God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The example of Joshua and Caleb in the Bible shows us what it is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joshua and Caleb were not the ones who overcame in Numbers 13 and 14; it was the One in whom they trusted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God did everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They simply enjoyed what God did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Joshua 3 they crossed the Jordan River, but it was God who stopped the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They simply walked over.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not try to overcome your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is our great I Am, and He is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do something for ourselves, we are attempting to be our own savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are declaring that we do not need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we declare that we are wretched and hopeless and cannot do anything to rescue ourselves, then we are declaring that we need a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: If in our fallen nature we are Satan, how can we live a grafted life with the Lord flowing through us to express Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Answer: We are the branches grafted into the cultivated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the stronger life, and we are the weaker life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regardless of what Satan would do, Christ is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as we abide in Him, we remain in the place where we are grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ will do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An antibiotic is stronger than the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We know that it deals with the germs, but we do not know how, and we do not need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith stops our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith even "blinds" us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have faith, we are like blind men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Abraham did not know where the Lord was leading him or what route he was taking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He only knew that the Lord was leading him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be too clear is to not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Question: It seems that it is easy to have faith when I am in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, as soon as I return home, there are "giants" waiting to devour what I have enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Answer: Faith is always real and true.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The environment is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Listen to faith, not to the lie.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our environment is good, we do not need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to believe when we are in a difficult environment.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Worry, anxiety, and even physical sickness, all are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Faith always tells the environment that it is a lie, not a giant.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To deny the environment is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In Numbers 13 and 14, Joshua and Caleb took the word of God as their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The unbelieving Israelites all saw the giants in Canaan and gave an evil report.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, Joshua and Caleb said, "Only do not rebel against Jehovah; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread" Num 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not recognize the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not say that the meeting hall is the mountain top and that your home is so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you say this, you are standing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Your home is much better than the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is like the third heavens and the Holy of Holies, because wherever Christ is, there is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sometimes we help Satan to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our husband or wife may not be that bad, but because we say they are bad, they become bad.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more we talk in this way, the worse they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of speaking opens the door to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to shut the door by declaring something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should say: "I am not defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>My being defeated is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Satan, this lie must return to you."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To proclaim in this way is to exercise faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Faith is against the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Question: Some of the persons whom we are visiting are involved in improper matters.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Should we tell them not to try to change themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Answer: We should not tell them this.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should simply bring them into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to help them to believe into Christ and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord Jesus did not tell Zaccheus to restore fourfold what he had taken from others.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord only ministered Himself into Zaccheus and did something within him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It was not Zaccheus himself who could give half of his possessions to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It was the Lord within him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He experienced a dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we go to visit people, we must learn to speak Christ, to speak by the Spirit, that is, to minister Christ, the Spirit of life, into them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then their salvation will be dynamic and organic, not something of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Their salvation is not a receiving of a certain religion to change their way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, we have to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>While we are going out to speak to people we need to be praying: "Lord, regardless of how good my word is, it is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You are the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>While I am speaking, You must come out with my word."</S>
