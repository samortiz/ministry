   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Several Basic Principles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In summarizing the above points, there are several basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the church must stand on the positive side of whatever is in the Bible and forbear the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If some are weak and unable to come up to what is in the Bible, the church needs to forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, certain truths in the Bible have two sides, as we have already spoken of concerning the doctrine of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the church must also have both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having only one side will bring forth a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, by all means the church must reject what is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, those who follow the Lord faithfully will leave when they see the church practicing what is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At any rate, we must stand on the positive side of what is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever the Bible allows both sides, we must stand on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we must reject whatever is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fourth, we should allow people the freedom for whatever the Bible allows people freedom for, such as observing the Lord's Day or the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that the Bible does not believe in the Lord's Day, but that the weak ones still believe in the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are still Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible absolutely approves of eating meat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if some are in favor of being vegetarian, the church must allow them to be vegetarian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This keeping of the Sabbath day does not refer to the Seventh-day Adventists.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Seventh-day Adventism involves the matter of the law; it is a whole system.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is entirely contrary to the book of Galatians, and it is a heresy not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church that includes all of God's children can be counted as the true church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have some special doctrine or some special emphasis, if we accept certain kinds of teaching at the expense of the rest of the children of God, we cannot be considered as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot be the church without inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With inclusiveness we will begin to see that we can be brothers and sisters to all of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can be with anyone who loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The leading brothers, therefore, must grow before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They must touch the highest and the most perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me repeat: If we have not attained to the highest, our heart should be big enough so that we do not hinder our brothers under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we cannot attain or climb up and do not allow others to go on, we are a sect, not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not become a church just by putting up the name of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We become a church only when there is spiritual inclusiveness that includes all of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the church includes rather than excludes God's children, the church will not be responsible for brothers who desire to go another way, because it is they who are creating the division, not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we must be broken to pieces!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be dug deeply!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot consider ourselves the measuring stick of the church; we are too short.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has a work for every brother and sister, and He has committed something to each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When everyone can be placed, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church, therefore, must be inclusive, not exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone Serving</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not a church can stand in the position of the church also depends upon whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to work, that is, whether she gives all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must heed one thing: When a believer receives the life of God, he has the disposition to serve God; his nature wants to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not give him the opportunity to serve God, there will be a breakdown, and he will become sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His new nature wants to serve, but if he cannot serve among us, he will find another place to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many sects originate from the desire to work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people want to serve God, but because they have no way to get through, they seek another way and become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The teachings in the Bible are very clear on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are three portions in the Scripture that show us that the Body of Christ has a special relationship with service.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 12:4-5 says, "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These two verses say that we are one body and individually we are members.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 6 through 8 say, "And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, or service, or he who teaches, or he who exhorts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>" In other words, the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church, like a body, includes many members.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In fact, it includes every member.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a member, we must give each one work to do; we must give each one the opportunity to develop his functions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul showed us that no matter what kind of gift we have, we should only function to the extent that our gift allows.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never do over and above the degree of our faith; we must leave room for other brothers to function.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do all the work, other brothers will have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we take over all the tasks, other brothers will have no tasks to tackle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we preach all the messages, other brothers will have nothing to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, it is better for one person to take one portion in the church, not for one person to take two, and even more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is better not to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A portion must be assigned to every brother.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every brother and sister must be given the opportunity to serve God just as we have the opportunity to serve God.</S>
