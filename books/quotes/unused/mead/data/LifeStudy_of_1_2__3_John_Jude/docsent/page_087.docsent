   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE VIRTUES OF THE DIVINE BIRTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRACTICE THE DIVINE LOVE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:10b-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 John there are three main sections: the fellowship of the divine life 1:1 2:11 , the teaching of the divine anointing 2:12-27 , and the virtues of the divine birth 2:28 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first portion in the third section 2:28 3:10a is concerned with the practice of the divine righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With this message we come to the second portion of this section 3:10b 5:3 , a portion on the practice of the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the divine birth there is a virtue that enables us to practice the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BY THE DIVINE LIFE AS THE DIVINE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to practice the divine love as a virtue of the divine life, we need the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine life is the divine seed that we all have within our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to the divine life that has been sown as the divine seed into our being, we also have the divine Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The divine life and the divine Spirit are the capital within us that enables us to practice the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine life is the source, and the divine Spirit is the One who actually carries out the matter of loving others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The divine love is our daily living as the expression of the divine life carried out by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine life and the divine Spirit are basic factors for the practice of the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the divine life and by the divine Spirit, we can have a love that is divine and not merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This divine love in the daily living of the children of God is an evidence that we have both the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The One Not Loving His Brother</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being Not of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 3:10b John says, Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not out of God, and he who does not love his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Righteousness is the nature of God s acts; love is the nature of God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What God is, is love; what God does is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Love is inward; righteousness is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, love is a stronger manifestation that we are the children of God than righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the apostle, from this verse through verse 24, proceeds further, from righteousness to love, in the manifestation of the children of God, as a further condition of the life that abides in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a serious thing for John to say that everyone who does not love his brother is not out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As children of God, we certainly are of God and even out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we are out of God, we surely have God s life and God s Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spontaneously, we live a life of loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if someone does not have such a love, this is an evidence that he has neither the divine life nor the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, there is a serious question concerning whether such a one is a child of God, born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Loving the brothers is a strong evidence that we are out of God, having God s life and enjoying God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Loving One Another</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>the Message Heard from the Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 11 John goes on to say, Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The message heard from the beginning was the commandment given by the Lord in John 13:34, which is the word the believers heard and had from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 11 the phrase from the beginning is used in the relative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The love spoken of here is a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord.</S>
