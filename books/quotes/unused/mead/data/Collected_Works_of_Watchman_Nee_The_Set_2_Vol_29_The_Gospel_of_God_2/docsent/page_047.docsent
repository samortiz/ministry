   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Another thing that we have to realize is that the person spoken of here must be a Christian, for only a Christian is clean in his body as a whole and can thus enter into life after dealing with his lust in a single member of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It would not be enough for the unbelievers to cut off a hand or a foot.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if they were to cut off both hands and both feet, they would still have to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to enter the kingdom of the heavens, it is better for a Christian to have an incomplete body than to go into eternal fire because of incomplete dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following this, verse 9 says, "And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows us that if a saved person does not deal with his lust, he will not be able to enter into life, but will go into eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The eternal fire here is the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible shows us that a Christian has the possibility of suffering the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although he can suffer the Gehenna of fire, he cannot suffer it forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He can only suffer it during the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 18 is not the only portion of Scripture that says this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Other portions of the Bible also contain the same teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 7 contains clear words of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 5:21-22 says, "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.'</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the beginning of chapter five, we read that the Lord Jesus saw the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But He did not teach the multitude; rather, He taught the disciples v. 1 . The Sermon on the Mount is for the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the one who reviles others in verse 22 is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He calls another brother Raca, that is, good-for-nothing, or Moreh, that is, a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he calls his brother this way, he shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not refer to an unsaved person, for an unsaved person will go to hell even if he does not call anyone Moreh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time the Bible talks about works, it refers to one who belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If such a one does not belong to God, there is no need to mention such things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a saved person, a brother, but because he has reviled his brother, he is liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 23 says, "Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times others hold things against us on purpose, and there is nothing that we can do about it; but if others complain because of our reviling, we have to be careful when we offer up our gift at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you think poorly of a brother and have spoken something against him, you have to go to him and deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift" v. 24 . The important thing is to be reconciled to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 25 says, "Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your brother is the plaintiff, and you are the defendant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now he is bringing you to court: "Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a thing will happen in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The kingdom is very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tonight I will speak a few frank and serious words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No two brothers or two sisters who are at odds with each other can appear in the kingdom together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the coming kingdom, there will only be love and mercy; only those who love and show mercy to one another can be in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I am involved in an argument with a brother, and if the matter is not dealt with in this age, then in the future, either both of us will be barred from the kingdom, or only one of us will get in. It cannot be that both of us will enter in. It is not possible for us to have a problem with each other and yet reign at the same time in the millennium in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the kingdom all the believers are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are absolutely no barriers between any two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If while we are on earth today, we have some friction with any brother or sister, or if we cause a hindrance to any brother or sister, we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Either we will go in and the other will be excluded, or the other will go in and we will be excluded, or both will be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord says that while you are with him on the way you have to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That means that while you and he are alive and before the Lord Jesus comes back, you have to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus will not tolerate two enemies complaining about each other in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we may harbor complaints about others very easily; but these complaints will either keep us outside, keep others outside, or keep both us and others outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the church today is very free, but it will not be like this in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"While you are with him on the way," says the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you die, or if he dies, or if the Lord Jesus returns, the way is ended.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, you have to settle the matter quickly before the Lord comes back and while both he and you are on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The judge is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"And the judge to the officer."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The officer is the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"And you be thrown into prison."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows us clearly that a brother who has offended another brother will suffer very severe punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you study this passage carefully, you will see that the prison here is the Gehenna of fire in verse 22, because verse 23 begins with "therefore."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The words from verse 23 on are an explanation of the words in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 22 says that anyone who calls his brother Moreh will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verses 23-25 follow by saying that those who are not reconciled to their brothers will be put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the prison in verse 25 is very clearly the Gehenna of fire in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are clear that there is no possibility for a Christian to perish eternally, but if a Christian has any unrepented of and unconfessed sins, which are not forgiven, he will suffer the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Notice the severity of the words of the Lord in verse 26: "Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is the possibility to come out if one has paid off everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the coming age, there is still the possibility of forgiveness, but one cannot come out until he pays the last quadrans and clears up everything with his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses 27 through 30 form another section.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This section is similar to the preceding one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery.'</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The commandment in the Old Testament says that we should not commit adultery, but the commandment of the New Testament says that we cannot even have adulterous thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The word woman in the original language refers to another man's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the woman is not another man's wife, there would be no possibility for adultery, because adultery is unfaithfulness in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If this is not another man's wife, this cannot be considered adultery; it is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible judges fornication, but not as much as it judges adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Here it is saying that an adulterous thought is produced towards another's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Second, the scope of the word in the original language for look here is not as broad as that of our word look.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The word look brings too many under the category of this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the original language it does not imply a casual looking but an intentional looking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Looking could simply be glancing at something accidentally on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Watch may be a better word because watching is an intentional looking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, in the original language the watching here is done with a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We could translate, "every one who watches a woman with the purpose of lusting after her."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What the Lord condemns are not the sudden thoughts that enter your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What He is dealing with is the further watching for the purpose of lusting, after a sudden thought comes in. In other words, our sins do not lie in Satan's inciting of the flesh by giving us filthy thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our sins lie in the further watching after Satan has given us a sudden thought.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sudden thoughts are from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Watching is from you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Sudden thoughts are temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your watching is your accepting of the temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must know how to differentiate between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Verse 29 says, "So if your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If your right eye causes you to watch, pluck it out and throw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"For it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If the lust is not removed, if the sin is not dealt with, a person will be "cast into Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then verse 30 says, "And if your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to pass away into Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>These are words that the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Christ told those who belonged to Him and who desired that their righteousness would excel that of the Pharisees and the scribes v. 20 that they have to deal with their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If they allow sin to develop in them, though they will not eternally perish, there is the possibility that they will "pass away into Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is what the Lord shows us in the book of Matthew.</S>
