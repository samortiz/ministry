<p>1. BECOMING A SWEET-SMELLING SAVOR</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  Leviticus 1:9</p>
<p>Before man&mdash;we become ashes.<br />
Before God&mdash;we become<br />
a sweet-smelling savor.</p>
<p>2. LETTING GOD WORK ON US</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 2:10</p>
<p>When we consecrate ourselves to God we are saying that we consent to His working on us, in order that He may work Himself with all His riches into our being.</p>
<p>3. GROWING IN LIFE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.&rdquo;</strong> Romans 6:19</p>
<p>When we consecrate ourselves to God, God&rsquo;s life has the opportunity to work in us to separate us from everything that is common, so that we may be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PRACTICE OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>1. WHAT DO WE CONSECRATE?</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Ourselves</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They gave themselves first to the Lord...through the will of God.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Corinthians 8:5</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Our Bodies</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present...your members as weapons of righteousness to God.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 6:13</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Our Possessions</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth,...but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,...for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 6:19-21</p>
<h2 class="head2">(4) Our Best</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;All the best...the firstfruits of them which they [the Israelites] shall offer unto the Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  Numbers 18:12</p>
<h2 class="head2">(5) Our All</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;...put in all the livelihood which she had.&rdquo;</strong>  Luke 21:4</p>
<p>2. PASSING THROUGH THE GATE OF<br />
CONSECRATION&mdash;THOROUGHLY,<br />
ONCE FOR ALL</p>
<p>You should have a thorough confession and prayer once before the Lord. You must hand over to Him everything that you are, everything that you can do, and everything that you have.</p>
<p>Please itemize below everything that you should consecrate to God:</p>
<p>3. WALKING IN THE WAY OF CONSECRATION&mdash;DAILY RENEWING OUR CONSECRATION</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it.&rdquo;</strong>  Leviticus 6:12</p>
<p>To walk in the way of consecration, we need to consecrate daily and consecrate everything.</p>
<p>Please remember: Your consecration has been accepted by God, and you cannot repent of it.</p>
