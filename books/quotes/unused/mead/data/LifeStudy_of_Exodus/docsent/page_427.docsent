   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HELD, SUSTAINED, AND JOINED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to this picture of the priestly garments, Christ holds the church and sustains the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The breastplate is held by the ephod, and the shoulder-pieces are supported by the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we must see that the long skirt signifies the church joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From this we receive an impression of where the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is in Christ, on His breast; the Church is upon Christ, upon His shoulders; and the church is joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The robe is called the robe of the ephod because it was mainly for the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the ephod we see Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the long robe is for Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic interpretation of this long robe is that it signifies both the individual and corporate Christ as God s full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this expression we have Christ and also the church joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FEATURES OF THE ROBE All of Blue</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to 28:31, the long robe of the ephod was all of blue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the church is all heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Testament gives us this revelation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is not in heaven, but the church is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In nature and position the church is not earthly but heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 3:7 indicates that we have been born from above.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This reveals that heaven, not earth, is our source.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, even though we are on earth, we have been born from above, from heaven, and have a heavenly life with a heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even our position is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Its Opening</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exodus 28:32 says, And there shall be an opening for the head in the middle of it; there shall be a border of woven work around its opening; like the opening of a coat of mail it shall be, that it may not be torn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse indicates that the long robe was woven in such a way that it was one whole piece.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the top was an opening woven very strongly, like the opening in a coat of mail used for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reference to a coat of mail in verse 32 indicates that the priestly service is a warfare Num 4:23, margin to war the warfare .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While we are serving as priests, we are also fighting as warriors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our robe is a priestly garment, but the opening is like that of a coat of mail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 32 says that the opening was like a coat of mail so that it may not be torn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that something could happen to damage the garment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are here as a testimony of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we cannot avoid warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not want to fight, but many times we have been attacked by others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, our priestly garment must have the kind of opening to indicate that our ministering is a fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pomegranates and Bells</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 33 and 34 say, And you shall make upon its skirts pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, on its skirts all around; and bells of gold in the middle of them all around: a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe all around.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 33 speaks of pomegranates and bells, and verse 34, of a bell of gold and a pomegranate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the garment was being made, the pomegranates came before the bells.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in function, the bells come before the pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have pointed out, the skirts are a sign of fullness, and the fullness of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the pomegranates and bells on the skirts must be matters related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The pomegranates and bells were not part of the tunic, which does not signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were the bottom part of the robe, which does signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we need to consider the pomegranates and the bells as related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The pomegranates were made of linen signifying humanity, and the bells were made of gold signifying divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the pomegranates we have humanity, and with the bells we have divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church life we always have humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Humanity is related to the pomegranates, and divinity, to the bells.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you see a ripe pomegranate with its seeds, you will receive an impression that a pomegranate is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible pomegranates signify the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church should be full of life in her humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the significance of pomegranates made of linen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church differs from Christ in that Christ never makes mistakes, but the church does make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You and I often make mistakes, especially when we act too hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, we need the golden bells to warn us not to walk too fast or carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fullness of life is expressed in the church s humanity, but the voice of warning is expressed in the church s divinity, as signified by the golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The proper speaking of the church always comes from her divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If in the church we speak from ourselves, that is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to learn to be little bells uttering a sound that has its source in divinity, not humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a sound is pleasant and gentle, for it comes not from a steel bell but from a golden one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What the church needs is not a few large bells, but a great many small ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I can testify that throughout the years in the church life, I have been warned a number of times by the speaking of young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes they stand up and speak something in the meeting that is a warning to me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It seems that I hear the sounding of a little golden bell warning me not to walk carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a description of a particular aspect of the church life: the church speaking out of divinity, based upon the fullness of life in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we all express the fullness of Christ as life in our humanity, there will be among us many golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then there will be God s speaking, God s voice expressed through the divinity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In each of us there is a certain amount of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this element of divinity a sound comes out in a small scale, like the ringing of a little bell.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First we have the expression of the fullness of life and then the sounding of the golden bells, that is, the speaking from the divinity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church has humanity for the expression of the fullness of life and also divinity for the sounding of the golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First we have the fullness of life, the pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Out from this we have the sounding of the bells.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, it is difficult to tell which comes first, the sounding of the bells or the expression of the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Both are in the church as the long train of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the local churches we have pomegranates and bells.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, if you visit the degraded part of Christianity, you may not find any pomegranates or bells.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No matter what you may say or how you may walk, you may not hear any warning sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But in the churches there are many voices of warning, voices that come from the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the church we are not under human control.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Certainly no one is controlling the way we think.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I can testify that I do not control the elders in Anaheim and that they do not control me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, we all are controlled by the pomegranates and the bells.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The proper church life is full of the expression of life in the pomegranates and of the warning from the sounding of the golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do you know what are the signs of the proper church life?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The signs are the pomegranates and bells.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>According to 28:34, the pomegranates and the bells were placed alternately, a bell and a pomegranate.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This indicates that the divine voice is interrelated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God did not command Moses to have only bells on the skirts of the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If in the church life we have bells without pomegranates, there will be gossip and criticism, not the ringing of golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if pomegranates are placed alternately with bells, gossip and criticism will disappear, and instead there will be a proper, divine sound.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In order for pomegranates to be placed alternately with bells in the church life, we need to grow in life and eventually blossom in life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then we shall become pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Instead of gossiping, we shall give forth a divine sound.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Furthermore, this growth in life will influence others and cause gossip and criticism to be replaced by the proper sounding of little golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If this is the experience of a certain brother, he may come to the meeting to testify of how he has been dealt with by the Lord in a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Through his speaking others may be warned, for they shall hear the sound of golden bells placed alternately with pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the church is proper and is truly Christ s fullness, His train, then on the skirt there will be pomegranates and bells.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the church there will be the expression of life and the divine sounding.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I have learned these things through experience and observation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Only by experience can we understand the significance of the typology of the long robe with pomegranates and bells.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>First we see that the pomegranates and bells are attached to the skirts of the long robe.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This indicates that they are related to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Furthermore, the pomegranates signify the fullness of life, and the bells are for sounding.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But the sounding is not from a human source; it is from a divine source, even divinity, as indicated by the fact that the bells are golden.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Whatever we speak in the church must be of divine origin, of the divine source.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At the same time, we need the fullness of life expressed in linen, in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Therefore, in the church we have the beauty of life expressed in our humanity and the divine sounding from the golden bells.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>These are signs of the proper church life.</S>
