<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(c) In Danger of Dying and Decreasing</H2><P>In Deuteronomy 33:6 Moses uttered a prophecy regarding Reuben. This prophecy, a judgment according to the law, was spoken through an experienced, sympathetic old man. Moses said, "Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few." This word implies that, according to the law, Reuben should have died. According to his sin, Reuben should have died (Ezek. 18:20). Although Reuben should have died, Moses was merciful in executing the judgment of the law. As an old judge, he judged the twelve tribes according to God's righteous law, but he nonetheless judged mercifully and sympathetically. Moses was concerned either that Reuben would die or that the number of his tribe would be greatly decreased. By this we see that fornication not only causes us to lose our birthright; it may also cause us to die or to be decreased. Therefore, we must flee fornication (1 Cor. 6:18).</P><P>Joseph received the birthright because he fled from the very defilement that Reuben indulged in (39:7-12). Joseph did not go in the house purposely to be with Potiphar's wife. He was a servant working in the house, and she tempted him. Joseph fled from this temptation. Whenever this temptation comes, the only way to deal with it is to flee. Do not talk or reason with the other party&#151;run away. Reuben lost the birthright because of his defilement, and Joseph obtained it because of his purity. God is righteous, just, and fair. Reuben was on the dark side, and he lost; Joseph was on the bright side, and he gained. Because Reuben was in danger of dying, or at least of being reduced, Moses prayed that he would not die. Anyone in the church life who commits fornication will be in a very dangerous position. He will not only lose the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ; he will be in danger of dying or of being reduced. This is the experience of Reuben.</P><P>The birthright is composed not only of the double portion of the land, but also of the kingship and the priesthood. As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited all three blessings. Due to his defilement, he lost not only the double portion of the land, but also the kingship and the priesthood. As we have seen, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah (1 Chron. 5:2), and the priesthood was given to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10). This typifies that today, if we allow ourselves to be defiled, we shall lose the double portion of enjoying Christ, the kingship, and the priesthood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(6) Concerning Simeon and Levi</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(a) Receiving No Blessing because of Their Cruelty</H2><P>We have seen that Simeon and Levi received no blessing because of their cruelty (34:25-30). Their cruelty in slaughtering and plundering the city of Shechem frightened their father to such an extent that he could not give them any blessing. Their indulgence in their disposition caused them to lose the father's blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(b) To Be Scattered in Israel</H2><P>Jacob was frightened by Simeon and Levi's cruel disposition. Hence, he would not allow them to dwell together. Rather, he exercised judgment over them to scatter them among the children of Israel so that they would not be able to behave cruelly according to their disposition.</P>
