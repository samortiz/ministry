[1]  The Spirit and the Service in the Spirit CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE FUNDAMENTAL MATTER OF SERVICE Scripture Reading: John 4:21, 23-24
[3]  In these messages we will consider the matter of the spirit and the service in the spirit.
[4]  We will see what the spirit is and what the service in the spirit is.
[5]  In other words, we will consider what our service should be before God and with what and in what we should serve.
[6]  In a broader sense, it means to serve God, including all the positive matters between God and us, such as our drawing near to God, praying to God, looking unto God, waiting on God, having fellowship with God, and working for God.
[7]  We have said many times that both the Scriptures and our experiences tell us that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.
[8]  Man not only has a body and a soul, but he also has a spirit 1 Thes 5:23 .
[9]  The spirit, which is also without a form, is the innermost part of man; it includes man s conscience, the intuition of God, and fellowship with God.
[10]  Man has a spirit, so he has the need of the spirit.
[11]  Likewise, if there were no God, there would be no need for the human spirit, and if there were no human spirit, man would also have no need for God.
[12]  However, man has a spirit, and man s spirit came into existence for man to contact God; therefore, man needs God.
[13]  AND MADE ALIVE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:1-5; Col 2:13; John 1:14; 3:3, 6; 6:63; 14:16-20
[14]  Likewise, God does exist, but man does not sense God s existence because man is ignorant of the fact that he has a spirit and therefore fails to use the proper faculty, the spirit within him, to contact God.
[15]  THE RISING UP OF THE SOUL AND THE FLESH
[16]  Because the spirit of man has lost its sense and function and therefore has become dead, and because man does not sense that he has a spirit, man lives according to the soul and the flesh.
[17]  The spirit of a fallen man is dead, but his soul and his flesh are still living.
[18]  Formerly his spirit was taking the lead within, but now since his spirit is dead, his soul has assumed the leading position.
[19]  Since his soul has assumed the leading position to rule over him and to control him, which was previously occupied by his spirit, this makes him unable to contact God and causes him to dislike being under God s ruling.
[20]  The Bible shows us that because man has fallen into the flesh and lives in the flesh, if God wants to save man, He must save him out of the flesh.
[21]  For this reason God Himself became flesh, and this God who became flesh was the Lord Jesus.
[22]  By His Spirit He put on our flesh and was put to death on the cross, on the one hand, crucifying and dealing with our flesh that we might be freed from our flesh, and on the other hand, through His resurrection, releasing and imparting Himself as the Spirit into us so that our spirit can be made alive and we can enter into our spirit.
[23]  People always thought that the Lord s intention was to teach them or save them in an outward way.
[24]  According to what the Lord was outwardly, Nicodemus regarded Him as a rabbi who came from God as a teacher to teach us.
[25]  Even when man came to Him outwardly and was healed physically, if he did not receive Him inwardly so that his spirit was made alive, then he still could live only in the flesh and not in the spirit, and he could live only according to the flesh and not according to the spirit, because his spirit was still dead.
[26]  To those who contacted Him or followed Him, the Lord not only showed them their inner needs but also led them to contact Him and have dealings with Him inwardly.
[27]  He showed Nicodemus that He is the One who is able to regenerate man, and then He led him to receive Him by exercising his faith inwardly.
[28]  Previously, Nicodemus outwardly regarded Him only as a teacher who came from God; he did not know that in Him was the Spirit of God and the life of God.
[29]  But the Lord showed Nicodemus that He had the Spirit of God and the life of God in Him and that if he would like to receive the divine Spirit and the divine life, then he must receive Him from within by exercising his faith.
[30]  BEING ABLE TO CONTACT GOD Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 6:63; Phil 3:3; Rom 8:6
[31]  In the two previous chapters we saw that all the service that God wants from man must be in spirit.
[32]  To enable us to serve Him in spirit, He became the Spirit through incarnation, death, and resurrection.
[33]  Then as the Spirit He comes to contact us in our spirit, making our deadened spirit alive so that we can serve Him by contacting Him as the Spirit in our enlivened spirit.
[34]  Only the service that comes out of the contact and fellowship of our spirit with the Spirit is the service that God wants, and only this kind of service is acceptable to Him.
[35]  We have already seen that God is Spirit and therefore He created man with a spirit that man may serve Him in spirit.
[36]  Therefore, when we serve Him, we must contact the Spirit in our spirit.
[37]  Unless a person s spirit is touched by the Holy Spirit, he has no way to understand the things of God and thus he cannot serve God.
[38]  We must be clear and remember that God is Spirit and that only the spirit can touch and contact the Spirit.
[39]  Therefore, if we want to contact and touch God in any matter, we must use our spirit.
[40]  A certain matter may be very spiritual, but if we do not use our spirit to contact God in that matter, we simply cannot touch God.
[41]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, when we pray, we must first have the sense and burden from God by contacting Him with our spirit and touching Him in our spirit, and then we must use our understanding, our mind, to express the sense and burden in our spirit with words of prayer.
[42]  All these four things contain or convey a certain kind of consciousness.
[43]  The life of the Spirit of life spoken of here is the life of God Himself, which is the highest life; therefore, it is the richest in consciousness.
[44]  This life within us causes us to be full of spiritual consciousness, enabling us to sense the spirit and the things of the spirit.
[45]  Since the spirit, in which rests the life of the spirit of life, is the mingling of God s Spirit with our spirit, then whatever this sense of life causes us to feel must be the story of the Spirit of God in our spirit.
[46]  THE SENSE OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[47]  This law is the law of the life of God.
[48]  Likewise, the life of God in our spirit also has its law, and it is also a law in our spirit.
[49]  Furthermore, the spirit in us the spirit mingled with the life of God is also the new man within us.
[50]  If in our outward action and behavior we mind the spirit of life within us, then we are living by the spiritual new man within us.
[51]  If we mind the spirit of life within us, we will naturally walk and live according to the law of the spirit of life within us.
[52]  CHAPTER FIVE DISCERNING THE SOUL FROM THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; 1 Cor 2:14
[53]  We have seen that by the sense of the spirit we can know the spirit.
[54]  Now we will see the difference between the soul and the spirit.
[55]  If we can discern the difference between the soul and the spirit, we then can deny the soul and be delivered from the soul in all matters of our living and service in order to live before God by the spirit and serve God by the spirit.
[56]  If we desire to have true spiritual growth in life and proper spiritual knowledge in service, we must know that the spirit and the soul are two different things, and we must be able to differentiate the soul from the spirit, discerning what is the soul and what is the spirit, what is soulish and what is spiritual.
[57]  First Corinthians 2:14 says, But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God...and he is not able to know them.
[58]  This word speaks clearly and thoroughly concerning the condition of the soul as to the things of the Spirit of God.
[59]  The soul is our personality, our ego; therefore, the soul is our self.
[60]  That which is included in our soul, analytically speaking, is the mind, the emotion, and the will these three parts.
[61]  Regardless of whether a man is in the mind, in the emotion, or in the will, he is soulish.
[62]  If we can recognize what kind of person is soulish, it is not difficult to realize what kind of person is spiritual.
[63]  Since a soulish person lives by the mind, emotion, or will, a spiritual person must be one who does not live by these.
[64]  Since a soulish person lives by the soul and not by the spirit, then a spiritual person must live in the spirit and not in the soul.
[65]  We must see that the soul is impotent in the things of God and worthless in spiritual things.
[66]  No matter how excellent and strong any part of our soul may be, it still cannot apprehend the things of God or understand spiritual things.
[67]  In the previous chapter we saw the distinction between the soul and the spirit.
[68]  We also saw that a saved person should live before God by the spirit and not by the soul.
[69]  One possibility is to live in the outer man and the other possibility is to live in the inner man.
[70]  This kind of visitation is a right thing, yet it is from the wrong source.
[71]  For example, a brother may come to you after he has an argument with his wife at home, and he tells you the problem from beginning to end. While considering which Bible verses to use to teach him concerning the problem, you remember Ephesians 5.
[72]  OF THE SOUL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:7, 10, 16 REJECTING THE THINGS OF THE SOUL
[73]  In the previous chapter we saw how to serve in spirit and how to serve God by exercising our spirit.
[74]  Only at this time, and only under such circumstances, can you truly return to the spirit.
[75]  Only then can the spirit in you have the opportunity to let you touch its feeling.
[76]  Thus, you can walk by the spirit, exercise the spirit, and serve God in spirit.
[77]  One who serves God in spirit must be one who hates, condemns, and judges the self and who fears the self much more than he fears sin and the world.
[78]  Thus, he will be able to serve God by contacting Him, touching Him, and fellowshipping with Him in spirit.
[79]  For this reason, God often disciplines us through outward circumstances.
[80]  He arranges persons, matters, or things to deal with our being, including our mind, emotion, and will.
[81]  If you do not allow God to enlighten you to such an extent so that you see that your thoughts must be condemned before Him, then it will not be easy for you to put them aside.
[82]  This is shown in 2 Corinthians 4, which says, We have this treasure in earthen vessels v. 7 . We know that this treasure denotes the Lord s life.
[83]  The Lord s life is truly a treasure that we have obtained.
[84]  However, since this treasure is put into an earthen vessel, it is not easily manifested, so God must come in to break the earthen vessel.
[85]  If we see this point, we will clearly know where our service should be: not in the outer man but in the inner man; not in the soul but in the spirit; not in the mind, emotion, or will but in the spirit of life.
[86]  If we know this and have this experience, we will be able to discern if a person s service is from the spirit or from the soul.
[87]  We will not try to determine someone s worth before God according to what he is and does outwardly.
[88]  We will be able to touch a person s inner parts to know if his living today is in the soul or in the spirit and to know if he is living in the soul or in the spirit.
[89]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE SERVICE WHICH IS FROM GOD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:5-6 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God, who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
[90]  The two mentioned in verse 5 are ourselves and God, and the two in verse 6 are letter and Spirit.
[91]  The service which God wants from us does not focus on doing a work but on ministering life.
[92]  Even if we were to bring all the people in this locality into the church, convert all the houses into meeting halls, and stir up so many people to zealously preach the gospel, in God s eyes it would all be empty and worthless unless these people have the divine life, are filled with some of the divine element, have received enough of God, and have sufficient knowledge of God.
