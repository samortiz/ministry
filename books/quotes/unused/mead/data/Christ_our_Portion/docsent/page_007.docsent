   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO WALK IN CHRIST BEING TO WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To live, walk, and have our being in Christ is simply to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How do we know that we are in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Romans 8, to be in Christ is to walk according to spirit v. 4 . To walk according to spirit means to have no condemnation in Christ Jesus v. 1 . Although many brothers say that they are in Christ, they also testify that they have a lot of condemnation within.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this condemnation is that they are walking in the soul according to flesh and not walking in the spirit, according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you are walking in the spirit, there is no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say that there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus v. 1 is equal to walking according to spirit v. 4 . When we are walking in spirit in reality, it is at that moment that we experience no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if we are out of the spirit, there is condemnation all of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Normal Christian Life by Brother Watchman Nee has helped many brothers and sisters by opening up chapters five through eight of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, my burden is that those who were helped by this book would walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How many brothers and sisters walk in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the victory; He is the life through which we are being saved from many negative things Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet how much do we enjoy Christ day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How much did we enjoy such a living salvation from so many negative things today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the doctrine and teaching about Romans 5 8, but how much enjoyment of what is taught about Christ in these chapters do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have the teaching, but we may not have the enjoyment of the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to help us enter into the enjoyment of the teaching found in Romans, I will not give any more definitions in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, I will give some experiences and illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>OVERCOMING SINS BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was a young Christian, I was taught by others' writings and through sermons on Romans 6 8 to overcome sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Someone would speak about victory over sin or the release from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I heard this, I would pray much saying, "O Lord, I do long to have the victory over all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How much I desire to be released from all of the sinful things!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I prayed, but the more I prayed, the more failures I had.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more I prayed for victory over sin, the more I was defeated by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For many years I did not know the reason for this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, I began to understand that my shortcoming was that I was asking the Lord to do something for me while I was a person still living in my soul, not in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I began to realize that there was no need for me to pray for victory over sin or for the release from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I simply needed to practice to turn to the spirit, forgetting about victory over sin and the release from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I realized that I must turn to the mingled spirit, staying in the spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I practiced to keep my mind away from sin or the victory over sin, and to set my mind upon Christ in my spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the realm of the mingled spirit, there is no need to strive for victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to learn one thing not to overcome sin but to walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I found out that whenever I was out of the spirit, immediately I was in another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In that realm there was the need to strive for the victory over sin.</S>
