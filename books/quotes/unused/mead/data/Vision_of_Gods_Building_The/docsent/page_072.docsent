   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM CONTINUED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen twenty-eight points concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are still many additional points to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>29 THE CITY FOURSQUARE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The twenty-ninth point is that the city is a large square.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 21:16 says, "And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The measurement of the city is equal in three dimensions, each dimension being twelve times one thousand furlongs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the perfect squareness of the city we must learn the principle that nothing in the church life should be oblique; everything must be straight and square.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regarding the serpent, the real symbol of Satan, nothing is straight or square; every part of him is cunning and crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times brothers in the Lord have come to us and to other Christian workers to try to teach us to be a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They feel we should not be so straight, so open, so frank, but rather a little "wise."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have replied, "You are not teaching us to be wise, but to be cunning like the politicians."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church life we should never act like a lawyer in the law court or a diplomat in the United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are dear Christian brothers; we must be as straight as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During His last week on earth, the Lord Jesus was confronted by the elders and Pharisees, the chiefs of the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They asked the Lord who had given Him the authority to act as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord did not answer these men immediately, but said, "I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The baptism of John, whence was it?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From heaven or from men?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matt 21:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These men reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They held a political conference, and they decided to tell the Lord Jesus, "We know not."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the Lord knew that they knew, but that they would not tell the truth; so He replied, "Neither tell I you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this passage Matt 21:23-27 the King James Version does not give the proper rendering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It quotes these men as saying, "We cannot tell"; but the Greek text means, "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These men lied, but the Lord Jesus would not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were crooked, but the Lord Jesus was straight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>30 THE TRANSPARENT CITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The thirtieth point is that the New Jerusalem is completely transparent Rev 21:18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that there is nothing opaque or hidden there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church life today everything must not only be pure and clean, but also transparent as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be nothing covered or hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are some real lessons to learn in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be checked and straightened, purified and made transparent, by the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything in us which is cunning or hidden is of the enemy, of the serpent, of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may hide some "small" matter for one, two, or even twenty days; we may even conceal something for twenty months or possibly ten years; but on the first day of the eleventh year it will come to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can never hide anything for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church everything must be clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>31 THE CITY FULL OF GOD'S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the city is so straight and transparent, it is full of the glory of God Rev 21:11, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, the glory of God is the very content of the city, for the city is completely filled with His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that the city is a vessel to contain and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To illustrate this point, let us consider a common table lamp: a typical lamp has an outer covering called a lampshade, while within the lamp there is the fullness of light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The lamp expresses the light, and the light is the very content of the lamp and the shade.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The glory of God is just God Himself being manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Jerusalem is full of God's glory; therefore God is manifested in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The normal church life today is the same: it is full of God's glory, manifesting and expressing God.</S>
