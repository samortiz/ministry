<p>Not only should the full-timers learn these three things, but every saint should also learn them. First, you all have to learn the truth. This requires that you pay the price and make an effort to study carefully. One time I asked the elders what the meaning of <em>Jesus</em> is and what the meaning of <em>Christ</em> is. It was as if they were all inexperienced, for none of them could give me a clear answer. Since we all have been serving in the church for years, we should not have some who are still inexperienced. Suppose you teach a group of students English, but at the end some of them have not learned anything, and others have learned only half of everything. Would you continue to teach them? Most of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are currently in this kind of situation. The majority of the saints have learned only half of the truth, so ultimately no one has learned the truth in a complete way. Thus, there is no way to build up the service and no way for the Lord to go on.</p>
<p>Now that all the life-studies of the New Testament have been published, I hope that all the churches would take this set of books as the basis for their study and greatly promote the learning of the truth. In every church we have to help all the saints to study the Recovery Version of the New Testament, especially the footnotes, in a careful and thorough way. This will truly be a great task. In the past we felt that we had nothing to do. Actually, this was because we did not do anything and did not want to do anything. Even when we truly wanted to do something, we could not find the way to do it, so we lost interest in doing anything. However, now the way has been clearly presented to us, and everything depends on whether or not we are willing to pay the price. If we are willing to pay the price, I believe that in three to five years the whole church will make great progress in learning the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Second, we have to encourage all the saints to preach the gospel from house to house. This will be very effective. All the full-timers should receive the burden to do this. When you go to the saints concerning this matter, do not go to the brothers first, because most of them will say that they do not have the time. You should contact the sisters, who are more likely to receive the burden because their hearts are softer. It is the same with the matter of the small groups&mdash;you have to work on the sisters first. Once they are set on fire, it will spread to the brothers, and eventually every home will be opened.</p>
 <p>We should also have a good campus work. There should be some who preach the gospel to the college students in every college. This is a crucial work. Furthermore, we must also do the children&rsquo;s work in a serious way because the children are the future of the church. You may want to consider preaching the gospel to the children first. Then, aside from gaining the children of the saints, you must also gain some from the unbelievers. This work is very worthwhile. If these five items&mdash;promoting the learning of the truth, preaching the gospel from house to house, shepherding in the group meetings, doing the campus work, and doing the children&rsquo;s work&mdash;are properly established, the church life will be living and healthy and will surely increase and multiply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING THE TRUTH TO BRING IN THE REVIVAL</h2>
<p>In order to serve, we all must be equipped with the truth, and in particular, we all must be familiar with the New Testament. All of you who have the heart to serve full-time must get yourselves fully equipped by studying the life-study messages thoroughly. Otherwise, when you go to establish the work, shepherd people, and speak to people, you will have nothing to say.</p>
<p>In this matter the co-workers should take the lead. We do not force the saints to read the life-studies, but every co-worker should read the life-study messages in a thorough way. In America all the doctors and nurses in the hospitals have to take examinations every year. In Taiwan some organizations also require their employees to take annual examinations. We have never held any examinations for the co-workers, so no one really knows whether they are qualified in the matter of the truth. It seems that once a person becomes a co-worker, he obtains a very secure job, and no one can dismiss him. Some co-workers even think that as full-time serving ones they are special people and that everyone has to listen to them. It is inappropriate and wrong to think this way. From now on we will not allow this kind of situation. Whoever wants to be a co-worker or to continue to be a co-worker must pass through an examination once a year.</p>
<p>Many Christians acknowledge that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery know the truth the most. However, we have to ask ourselves how many of us are really like this? Actually, the majority of the saints do not know the truth that much. Therefore, I hope that the Lord will be gracious to us by stirring up the churches all over the world to rise up and pursue the truth. I believe that if we endeavor for three to five years, the saints will be revived by studying the Word. This will bring in a big revival on the earth.</p>
<p>I hope that we can stir up this kind of a pursuing atmosphere in the church life. From now on, there should not be any more idle talk in the saints&rsquo; homes. Even when they converse, they should also study the truth. For example, when you go to a saint&rsquo;s home, you should not just greet him and ask, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; Instead, you should ask him, &ldquo;What does the genealogy in Matthew 1 talk about?&rdquo; You may also go further and ask him, &ldquo;Do you know that there are three important names in the genealogy in Matthew 1? They are Abraham, David, and Mary. These are three crucial persons who brought in Christ.&rdquo; When you meet a saint on the street, instead of talking to him about other things you should ask him, &ldquo;Which verse in the Gospel of John says that the Lord is edible? How did the Lord say that He was edible? Why did the Lord say that He was edible?&rdquo; Thus, in a conversation of just two minutes both of you will be reminded, supplied, and mutually nourished. We have to change the atmosphere and encourage the brothers and sisters to read the life-studies. Even when we are facing matters related to national affairs, such as an election, we still should not talk about them. Let those who belong to Caesar be occupied with Caesar&rsquo;s business. As those who belong to God, we ought to be occupied with God&rsquo;s business (Luke 20:25).</p>
<p>One time I was given hospitality at a couple&rsquo;s home. They were Chinese who lived outside of China and had never studied in a Chinese school, but they spoke very good Chinese. The hostess told me that because she had been meeting and listening to messages in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for a long time, she had learned Chinese very well. When I listened to her fellowship, however, I realized that she did not know the truth very much. Eventually, I found an opportunity to tell her, &ldquo;I am really grateful that you gave me hospitality and had three or four suits made for me, but I am very concerned about your spiritual situation. I hope that the next time I come we can talk about the truth.&rdquo; We all should do this to stimulate the lambs in our small group. Do not be afraid of offending others. We may offend someone today and tomorrow, but he will be grateful toward us the day after tomorrow.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
