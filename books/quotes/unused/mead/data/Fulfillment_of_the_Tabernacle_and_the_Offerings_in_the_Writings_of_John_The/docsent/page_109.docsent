   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY THE SIGNS IN JOHN ELEVEN 2 Scripture Reading: John 11:1-44</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in John 11.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SIGN OF SICKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 11:1-3 we see the sign of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 1 says, "Now there was a certain man who was sick."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 3 the sisters of Lazarus sent word to the Lord Jesus and said, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sickness is weakness leading to death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may say that sickness is the calling card of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that sickness indicates that death is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once I saw human life pictured in this way: birth, old age, sickness, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After someone is born, he begins to age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, he will become sick and then die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, sickness is an announcement that death is on its way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians may realize that when we are sick, we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we may not realize that this sickness, this weakness, is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you say that you are weak, you need to realize that your weakness is the "calling card" of death, for death is behind your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S DELAY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 11:4-6 we have the sign of the Lord's delay.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the sisters of Lazarus sent the news to the Lord Jesus that Lazarus was sick, no doubt their intention was that the Lord would come to heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when the Lord received this report, He did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we have the third sign in this chapter, the sign of the Lord's delay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was the reason for the Lord's delay?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was young, I was told that the Lord delayed because He was testing their faith, because He was teaching them to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not think that this is the reason for His delay.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's delay in this chapter is a sign that the Lord did not want to be a healing Savior but a life-giving Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Healing corresponds to the natural thought, but life-giving is a divine thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians have never heard about life-giving; they are not familiar with this term in the spiritual vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, it is common for Christians to talk about healing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not misunderstand me and think that I do not believe in divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I definitely believe in divine healing, and I myself have experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The point here is that the concept of healing is natural, whereas the concept of life-giving is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's intention is not merely to heal us, for in His sight we are not sick we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's salvation is not a salvation to heal the sick, but to enliven the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's salvation is to enliven the dead, to cause those who are dead to become alive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 10:10 the Lord Jesus did not say, "I came that they may have healing, and have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse He said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life is not psychological life psuche or physical life bios ; it is the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life of God zoe , which is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord came that we may have this divine, eternal life and have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter eleven the Lord Jesus delayed until He knew that Lazarus had died.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's delay here is a sign indicating that He did not intend to heal the sick man and thereby only be a healing Savior; rather, it was His intention to raise the dead and thereby be a Savior who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the reason the Lord did not come to do anything to heal Lazarus from his sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus waited not only until Lazarus had died, but even until he had been buried and had begun to stink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is actually a blessing to be in such a condition, for then we are qualified for the Lord's life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord will not resurrect a sick one; He will resurrect one who has died, who has been buried, and who has begun to stink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In principle, we all have asked the Lord to heal us of certain "sicknesses."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we were saved, we realized that we had certain defects and imperfections, and we wanted to improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, many of us wanted to be "healed" by the Lord of our troublesome temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I was saved and began to seek the Lord, I realized that the main defect in my human life was my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, I made up my mind that I would never lose my temper again, and I asked the Lord to help me in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a sense, I sent word to the Lord that I was "sick" with the illness of my temper and that He should come to "heal" me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, I can testify that the Lord did not come to heal me of this sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, the more I prayed about my temper, the worse this sickness became.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just as the Lord did not heal Lazarus of his sickness, so He did not heal me of my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of us can give a similar testimony concerning our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 11 Mary and Martha seemed to be saying to the Lord, "Lord, the one whom You love is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, You are obliged by Your love for Lazarus to come and heal him."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the Lord set aside that request and delayed going down to Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord's disciples were not happy with this delay.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know this by the way the disciples responded to the Lord's word to them, "Let us go into Judea again" v. 7 . When the Lord said this to them, the disciples replied, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?" v. 8 . The disciples seemed to be saying to the Lord, "Why did You not go when the news came to You that Lazarus was sick? Why do You want to go now?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many things are exposed by the Lord's delay.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we want to go, He does not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when we do not want to go, He wants to go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will never take our way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, we need to follow His way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our Christian life we have uttered a number of vain prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may have prayed for the Lord to "heal" us in this manner or in that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But instead of healing us, the Lord allows us to become weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eventually, we become weak to the uttermost and die.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we die and are buried and have begun to stink, that is the right time for Him to come to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From experience we have learned that when we have become weak to the uttermost, weak to such an extent that we die, then the Lord will come not as a helper but as the life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord's desire as revealed in this chapter is not to help us, to be our helper; His desire is to be our life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But unless we die, we shall not realize that we need Him as our life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may think that we need Him only to be our helper.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because we have this realization, we often ask the Lord to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, often we have prayed to the Lord for help, but He did not come to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Like Martha and Mary, we sent news to the Lord about our sickness, expecting Him to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the Lord delayed before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord always does things in His own time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When He knew that the time was right, He said to His disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."</S>
