   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Making from One All Things,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>whereas Satan Unifying All Things through Money</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"All things'' are too much for him to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is too troublesome to gain all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"All things'' include cows, goats, wood, stone, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You could not exhaust the list of all things with a thousand lines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God made from one all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Satan reduces all things into one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This one thing is money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person has money, he has all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He makes all things simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Money is the means to unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All things are created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar'' Matt 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not take any money out from His own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All things can be reckoned in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The earth is created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet today man can reckon the price of land in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is possible, man would even reckon the price of the moon or the hydrogen in the sun with money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today man can buy everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He can buy time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He can even buy human souls.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One brother worked in the post office for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The post office had bought his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jacob's wealth included cattle and sheep and the souls of men as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has made from one all things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But Satan has unified all things into one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan Withstanding God through Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>and Usurping Man's Worship through Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we gain God, we have all things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, mammon becomes the power, the center, of man's worship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is man going to worship God or mammon?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the controversy of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mammon is diametrically opposed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mammon can withstand God because it is the only thing that can unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Covetousness is not only a root of all evils 1 Tim 6:10 , it is the same as idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Riches are an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins Eph 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man has not dealt with his money in a clear way after he is saved, he is not yet fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet there are countless more people who worship mammon than people who worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mammon is the most common object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon Luke 18:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The same principle applies when Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor when he repented 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own v. 32 . By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack'' 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
