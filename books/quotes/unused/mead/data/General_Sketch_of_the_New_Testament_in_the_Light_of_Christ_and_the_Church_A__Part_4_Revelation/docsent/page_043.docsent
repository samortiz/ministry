   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Not Natural but in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 21:17 speaks of another aspect of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It says, And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have seen, the record in Revelation contains symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meaning for the symbols in verse 17 is given in Luke 20:36, which tells us that in the resurrection man will be equal to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is only in resurrection that man is like the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the wall in Revelation 21:17 is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is nothing of the natural life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we have to be human, but we must not be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be natural and live in the soul-life is wrong, but to be properly human is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must be in resurrection, and all our work and activities must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wall as the appearance and separation of the church life must be one hundred percent in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever we do or express must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All natural things, the soulish life, and the old nature have to be terminated by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church life must be truly human but not in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need the Lord s salvation and deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In both the West and the Far East I saw a number of brothers who insisted that we must be human.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, what they meant by being human was being natural.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be like monks; we should be human, but we must be human in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be human wives and husbands, but we must be human wives and husbands in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our natural life, soulish life, self, self-intentions, self-centeredness, and everything of the self must be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then a sister can be the best wife in resurrection; she can be very human yet one hundred percent in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not dress in a peculiar way like monks, and the sisters should not dress like nuns.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we need to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we may be human in a completely natural, soulish, or fleshly way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our clothing we may be not only human but fleshly, worldly, natural, and soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not we have the reality of the expression of God must be checked both by the measure of the golden reed and by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These two measures are very important, practical, and real.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that we are spiritual and bear the proper expression, but we must be measured by the golden reed by the divine nature lived out in humanity and by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Does our living and daily life correspond to this measure?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If not, regardless of how spiritual we think we are, we are not truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once while I was speaking to a church in the Far East, I told the saints that to be a Christian, a child of God, we need to learn how to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the message a brother came to me excitedly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said that for a long time he had felt that the brothers and sisters there did not know how to be human, because they said that to indulge in sports and movies was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This brother s feeling was that as humans we need to do many things like this, and that these things are not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, I knew this brother s daily life, so I told him that to be human does not mean to be worldly, fleshly, and soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we learn the lesson of being measured by the golden reed and keep the principle of the measure of a man, that is, of an angel, we will know the proper way to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The proper way is to be very human but fully in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Having Eternal Perfection</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>in the Divine Administration</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The wall of the New Jerusalem is a hundred and forty-four cubits high v. 17 . A hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve, signifying that the New Jerusalem is full of God s perfection in His eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The number twelve is the mingling of three with four.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Three represents the Triune God, and four represents the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Twelve, therefore, signifies that God is mingled with His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The separating wall in our Christian life and church life must be the mingling of the Triune God with humanity, full of eternal perfection in the eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a wall is high enough to keep out all the evil things; the serpent can no longer creep in. The high wall with the standard of eternal perfection, of the divine administration, and of the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures is our separation and protection.</S>
