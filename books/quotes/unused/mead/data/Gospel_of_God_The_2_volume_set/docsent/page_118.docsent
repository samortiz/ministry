   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FAITH VERSUS REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past two messages, we have seen that the way of salvation on man's side is through faith, rather than the law or works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that salvation is by faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not by faith with the law, nor is it by faith with works Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, besides the law and works, man still tries to use other ways to obtain God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we cannot cover these ways in detail, we hope that we can enumerate all of them in the coming two messages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Besides the law and works, repentance also is often considered by man as a very important condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man thinks that if he does not repent, he will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are acquainted with the Bible dare not say that repentance is the only condition for salvation, but they would say that a man is saved by faith with repentance, or through repenting and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I admit that the subject of repentance is not easy to understand in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if one would consider the Word of God itself, he would understand the real meaning of repentance and would find out quickly if repentance is a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE THREE BOOKS ON SALVATION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NOT LISTING REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AS THE CONDITION FOR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we talk about the meaning of repentance in the Bible and its relationship with faith and salvation, we should first clarify a few things concerning repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After that, we will consider what the Bible says about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the entire Bible, there is only one book that tells us how we receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This book is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the very beginning to the very end of the Gospel of John, we cannot find a single occurrence of the word repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word repentance never occurs in this book at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This book tells us how we can have eternal life 3:15, 16b, 36 , but nothing is mentioned about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It mentions repeatedly that man receives eternal life through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a man believes, he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It never mentions repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only does it not mention repentance directly, it does not mention repentance even indirectly or metaphorically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a fact that we have to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, there are two books which tell us how man is justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are Romans and Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The book of Romans does mention repentance, but it never makes repentance a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither of these books has ever made repentance a condition for salvation and promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we have to remember that of the three books in the Bible that deal specifically with salvation, eternal life, and justification, not once is repentance mentioned as a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In all three books, faith is mentioned every time as the only condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows us clearly that man is saved by faith and not by works.</S>
