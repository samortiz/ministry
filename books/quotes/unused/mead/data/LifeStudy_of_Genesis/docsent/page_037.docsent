   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Central Points</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We now come to the central points of God's restoration and further creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 To Recover the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God needed to recover the earth for generating life and for dominion Gen 1:9, 26, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as the earth was under the death waters, there was no possibility to generate life or to have dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to have these two things, there was the need for the earth to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 To Have Man</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second central point was to have man as the expression of God Himself and to deal with God's enemy Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later we will see more of this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 To Generate Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third point was to generate life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was necessary for the ability to express God and to have dominion for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Remember these three central points: to recover the earth, to have man, and to generate life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the things created by God are numerous, in the record of Genesis 1 and 2 God only mentioned the matters of life and the items related to life, for His restoration and further creation were focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All God's creation was focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He recovered the earth, created man, and produced all kinds of life for the purpose of expressing Himself and dealing with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we come to the purpose of God's restoration and further creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 To Have Man to Express God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The main purpose of God's restoration and further creation was to have man, a corporate man, to express God Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The man God created was a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not create many men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created mankind collectively in one person, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God created Adam and Adam was a corporate man, a collective man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Adam was created, we were all created.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are thirty years of age today, don't say that you were created thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You were born thirty years ago, but you were created six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although I might have been born forty years earlier than you, we were created at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Adam was created, we were all created because we were all created collectively in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were included in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not create an individual man, but a corporate man to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 26 God said, "Let them" one man, but the pronoun is "them."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves that this man is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this verse, as the pronoun "us" signifies that God is triune, so the pronoun "them" signifies that man is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself.</S>
