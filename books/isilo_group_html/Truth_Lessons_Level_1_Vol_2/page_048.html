Jesus</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus was born, according to God&rsquo;s ordination He was named Jesus, which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah the salvation.&rdquo; This indicates that He is Jehovah God in the Old Testament becoming man&rsquo;s Savior and man&rsquo;s salvation to save God&rsquo;s people from their sins (Matt. 1:21).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Christ</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is also Christ (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31), the Messiah anointed by God (the anointed One, John 1:41), the Christ appointed by God (Acts 2:36) and commissioned by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan (Eph. 3:11; 1:10).</p><h2 class="head2">H. The Lord</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the Lord. While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the Bible confirms that He was the Lord. When the Lord Jesus was born, the angel declared that &ldquo;a Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 2:11). Moreover, when John the Baptist came, he was to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight (Matt. 3:3). The &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in the New Testament equals Jehovah in the Old Testament (compare Matt. 4:7 and Deut. 6:16). Jehovah is the divine title of the Triune God (Exo. 3:15). Therefore, the fact that Christ is called Lord proves that He is the Triune God (John 20:28).</p><h2 class="head2">I. The Resurrected Lord</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected (1 Cor. 15:3-4), the disciples saw Him and called Him Lord (John 20:18, 25, 28); at this time He was the resurrected Lord. Eventually, in His ascension, standing in the position of a man, He was made Lord by God (Acts 2:36); that is, God made Him the Lord of all things, to whom are all things, and the Lord of all men, unto whom are all men (Acts 10:36).</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is this last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to enter into His disciples to be their life (1 John 5:12) and to be joined to them as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Today He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) to dispense God&rsquo;s life to all who believe in Him.</p><h2 class="head2">K. The Life</h2><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am...the life.&rdquo; This life is God&rsquo;s eternal life. The Lord Jesus came that man may have life, the eternal life of God, and may have it abundantly (John 10:10). When man receives Him, He enters into him to be his life (John 3:15).</p><h2 class="head2">L. The Resurrection</h2><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is the resurrection. Resurrection is in contrast to death in particular; resurrection is that which passes through death and triumphs over death. The Lord Jesus passed through the death of the cross and entered into Hades, and then He came out of Hades and triumphed over the power of death (Acts 2:24). Therefore, He is the resurrection. Today the life within all the believers is the resurrection life which has the power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Incarnation</h2><p>The first major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was incarnation (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14a). He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself reaching man, and who entered into the womb of the virgin Mary to be mingled with humanity (Matt. 1:18, 20). After remaining there for a period of nine months, He was born. At that time there was an extraordinary man, a God-man, on the earth. He was God yet also man; He was both God and man. In Him was not only humanity, but also divinity. Therefore, through His incarnation He brought God into man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 1, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
