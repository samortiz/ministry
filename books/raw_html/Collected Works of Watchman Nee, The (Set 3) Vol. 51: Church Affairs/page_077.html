<h2 class="head2">Needing to Bring Mark</h2><p>Verse 11 continues, "Take Mark and bring him with you.'' This is the Mark about whom Paul and Barnabas contended. Remember that in Acts Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, but Paul disagreed because Mark went away when the work was at a crucial time. In the beginning they went together; but when the work was intense, Mark left, Mark got sick, and Mark was not able to work. Therefore, Paul did not agree to take Mark with them. At that time Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, perhaps because Mark was his relative. Therefore, the two had a sharp contention, and they went their separate ways. The amazing thing is that later Barnabas did not have the opportunity to work with Paul, but Mark had such an opportunity. Remember that Mark later had learned many lessons from Peter. The Gospel of Mark was dictated by Peter and written down by Mark. Shortly before Paul's death, Paul said, "Take Mark and bring him with you.'' For what reason? "For he is useful to me for the ministry.'' Mark was profitable to Paul for the ministry.</p><p>Verse 12 says, "But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.'' This shows us that this was the arrangement of the work. Paul asked Timothy to come, he asked Timothy to bring Mark with him, and he also sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</p><p>Verse 20 says, "Erastus remained in Corinth.'' Do you see? Paul was the one who knew the condition of the work the best.</p><h2 class="head2">Leaving Trophimus at Miletus</h2><p>"Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.'' Trophimus is one of the famous sick persons in the New Testament. Epaphroditus was one, and Trophimus was another.</p><p>"Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.'' Many times sick persons need to obey; they cannot say that they want to move around. If they are sick, they must stop for a little while. Paul said that he left Trophimus at Miletus. It was better for him to be left at Miletus and not be occupied with so many things.</p><p>Concerning Timothy, Paul said "Be diligent to come before winter.'' Paul gave him a definite time limit. Do not decide for yourself when to come. Be diligent to come before winter.</p><p>Brothers, we should see that this way is very clear. A brother like Paul, who walked before God, should be obeyed by Mark, Timothy, and Trophimus. If so, spontaneously, we will see that there is fellowship in the church, and spontaneously we will also be able to understand what authority is.</p><h2 class="head2">Titus Being Left in Crete<br />and Being Diligent to Go to Nicopolis</h2><p>Concerning Titus we do not need to say much. A few verses from the first and the last chapters of Titus are sufficient.</p><p>Titus 1:5 says, "For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.'' Are we clear? Titus was a young brother. In 2 Corinthians Paul indicated that he had entreated him to go to Corinth. They went to Crete together. Then Paul left Titus in Crete to complete the unfinished business. Paul told him how to set in order the things that were lacking, as he charged him. Here we can see authority and also fellowship.</p><p>Titus 3:12 says, "When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.'' Do you see? This is the way of the work. Paul said, "I want to send one of two brothers to you, maybe Artemas or Tychicus. It has not been fully decided; in any case, one will come to you. When he gets there, you need to come to me quickly in Nicopolis.''</p><p>Here we see how an elderly brother arranged many things and how a young brother listened to his word.</p>
