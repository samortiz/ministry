   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way to use this switch is given in 10:12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There it says, The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This divine electricity is rich to all who switch on, and the way to switch on is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By calling on the Lord we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we simply think about what the Lord is to us, we do not have any practical contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Remember, 10:12 says that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How simple this is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are released from the vanity of the natural mind, and we are kept in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>EXPERIENCING WHAT IS RELATED TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Designation is by resurrection, which includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these wonderful things are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By touching the Spirit, we enjoy resurrection and everything included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection is not a matter of doctrine; it is absolutely a matter of touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most simple way to contact the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we touch the Spirit, the more we enjoy resurrection and the more we are sanctified, transformed, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the book of Romans, the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God is related to at least ten items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All ten of these items are related to our experience of the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Firstly, the Spirit is related to holiness 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have pointed out that Paul even uses the term the Spirit of holiness in 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would partake of God s holiness, the essence of God s being, we need to contact the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 8:2 the Spirit is called the Spirit of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians today talk about life without realizing that life is related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life is extremely difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In speaking about life, it is best to speak from the standpoint of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be in life means that our inner being is living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By setting the mind on the spirit, we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if you set your mind upon your situation or your environment, you will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will sense that your inner being is depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you turn your mind to the spirit and set it on the spirit, you will be living once again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that life is manifested as livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life also energizes us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine life within us is never exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that as I speak in the Lord s ministry, the life within energizes me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, this same life strengthens and satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we experience life, we never have a sense of emptiness within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, we are richly satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, by life we become living, energized, strengthened, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we contact the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we become living, energized, strengthened, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Law</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 8:2, the Spirit is also related to law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse speaks of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here Paul tells us that this law sets us free from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law of the Spirit of life is versus the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the law of the Spirit of life is higher than the law of sin and of death, it sets us free from that law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have spoken about the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, the Spirit is holiness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the same principle, the Spirit is the law that sets us free from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This law is a spontaneous, automatic power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we touch the Spirit, we touch this law, this spontaneous, automatic power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we see this, we shall realize the vanity of expending our own effort to improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of striving, we should simply contact the Spirit and give place to the spontaneous working of the law of the Spirit of life within us.</S>
