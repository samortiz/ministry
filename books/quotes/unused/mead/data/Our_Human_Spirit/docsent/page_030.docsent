   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING BY PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to start to exercise our spirit by praying, because to pray, in principle, is something in the spirit Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are going to exercise your eyes, you have to see.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are going to exercise your feet, you have to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more you walk, the more you exercise your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In like manner, the best way for you to exercise your spirit is to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>LEARNING TO SENSE THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Maybe when you begin to pray, you are still in the mind, in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if you keep on praying, you will pray yourself into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even in our prayer we must deny the mind, the emotion, and the will, and learn to sense the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You shouldn't pray according to what you know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You shouldn't pray according to what you like, desire, or love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You shouldn't pray according to what you decide to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must deny the mind, emotion, and will, and take care of the inner sense deep within you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Maybe you made a decision to pray for the church, but when you go to the Lord and start the prayer, the sense within is something different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to forget about your decision and take care of the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The inner sense may indicate that you have to say something like this: "O Lord, even with the church, I'm too much in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your decision is to pray for the church, but the Lord gives you the sense that you are so much in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more you confess that you are in the flesh, the more you sense the anointing, the peace, the harmony, and the refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, if you stood with your decision to pray for the church against the inner sense, you would sense the dryness and emptiness within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEED OF PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must put all these principles into our daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever I do or say, I do it and say it by denying my mind, emotion, and will, and by sensing the inner situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that I am using and exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am living, walking, and doing things not by my self, but by my spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our spirit we have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just turn yourself to the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our spirit we have the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Practice to use and exercise your spirit.</S>
