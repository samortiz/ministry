<p>Genesis reveals that God created the universe and governs the universe (1:1&mdash;2:25). Ephesians shows that God created the universe and governs the universe according to His will and plan (1:9-10). God&rsquo;s universal government is His universal administration. According to the Bible, God&rsquo;s universal administration has been given to the charge of His appointed Christ (Acts 17:31; Rev. 1:5; 5:5-6).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s appointment of His Son as Christ is His appointment of Christ as His Administrator (1 Cor. 15:24-28; Rev. 11:15). Christ is God&rsquo;s Administrator. Whether in the creation of all things or in the accomplishment of redemption, Christ was executing God&rsquo;s will (1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 1:11, 20-22; Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:2-3). Government, however, is a matter of administration; hence, creation and redemption are different in nature from government.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament Christ was responsible for God&rsquo;s universal government after man fell and before He accomplished redemption according to God&rsquo;s will (Ezek. 1:26). The purpose of God&rsquo;s government at that time was to usher in Christ for the accomplishment of redemption. In the New Testament the focus of God&rsquo;s government is on the application of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption. Christ is still responsible for the execution of this government. This chapter will focus on God&rsquo;s universal government after the accomplishment of redemption.</p>
<p>Many pay attention only to Christ&rsquo;s position in God&rsquo;s creation and redemption and neglect His role in God&rsquo;s government, God&rsquo;s administration. The book of Revelation reveals this role to us. Revelation shows that Christ ascended to the heavens after He accomplished redemption, took the scroll of God&rsquo;s universal government, and became a strong Angel to execute God&rsquo;s universal government by placing His feet on the sea and on the land (10:1-2). In this chapter we will see the position that Christ occupies in God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S DEALING WITH THREE GROUPS<br />
OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Although millions of people have been and will be on earth from the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension to His second coming, they are represented by only three groups: the church, composed of the believers; the Jews; and the Gentiles, the nations on the earth (cf. 1 Cor 10:32). God will deal with the people on the earth based on their relationship to these three groups. The execution of God&rsquo;s dealings with these three groups has been given to Christ so that He might have the first place and be the center in dealing with all people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Church</h2>
<p>Among the three groups of people on the earth, those who have the deepest relationship with God are the believers, who constitute the church. On the one hand, they are God&rsquo;s children, born of Him, and strangers on the earth (Heb. 11:13). On the other hand, they are obligated to serve Him and live to Him because they have been graced by God (Rom. 12:1). Their faithfulness in this regard will be judged one day, and a specific reward or punishment will be meted out to them (Matt. 16:27; 25:14-30). All the things that God intends to do in the believers have been committed to Christ, who has saved them and to whom they belong, so that He may be honored and glorified in all matters.</p>
<p>At the end of this age Christ will return to rapture His believers. Before the great tribulation Christ will rapture those who have been watchful and prayerful at every time in order to keep them out of the tribulation that will come on the earth (Luke 21:36). Before they are raptured, Christ is their hope (Titus 2:13); after they are raptured, Christ is their joy (Rev. 19:7). In addition, a hundred and forty-four thousand overcomers will be raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion as firstfruits to God and to Christ Himself (14:1). These are those who have loved and followed Christ. He is their goal; thus, &ldquo;these are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go&rdquo; (v. 4). In His second coming Christ will be the Bridegroom to His believers, the One whom they love and for whom they have been waiting (Matt. 25:1, 13). As the Bridegroom, Christ will marry His loving and overcoming believers as His bride. What a glorious and sweet goal! Christ will bring the overcoming believers to His marriage dinner, and He Himself will be the center of that joyous feast (Rev. 19:7-9).</p>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation Christ will descend from heaven on a cloud to rapture the majority of the believers like the reaping of a harvest (1 Thes. 4:17; Rev. 14:14-16). Christ will transfigure their body to be conformed to the body of His glory and to be with Him in glory, according to His operation by which He is able to subject all things to Himself (Phil. 3:21). Christ will rapture them, transfigure them, and glorify them to be with Him forever. Christ will become their unique, beloved, and exalted goal (Rev. 15:3-4). In the new heaven and new earth Christ will come down to the earth in glory with His transfigured believers, and He will be manifested as the believers&rsquo; center of glory (21:2). In eternity Christ will shepherd His believers, deliver them from suffering eternally, and satisfy them so that they may serve God. In God&rsquo;s dealing with the believers, Christ will be all to them eternally (7:15-17).</p>
