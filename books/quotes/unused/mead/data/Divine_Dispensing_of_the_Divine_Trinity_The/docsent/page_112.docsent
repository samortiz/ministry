   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:1, 3-11, 13, 18, 24, 28; 14:4-5, 12, 25</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the functions of the members in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The functions of the members are the spiritual gifts, and these gifts are related to speaking in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 12:1 Paul says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 3 Paul goes on to say, Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse indicates that it is easy to function in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can function in the Spirit simply by saying, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, we may say, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are my life and my comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord Jesus, You strengthen me inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How many things we can say concerning the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the meetings of the church we can speak the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can say, Lord Jesus, Your name is Jehovah, the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, You also are called Jesus, Christ, Emmanuel, the Son of God, the Son of Man, and the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, You are the Lamb of God, and You are even the door.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we mention the names of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit will come in to function.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord will follow the Spirit to minister, to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord will serve you, and then through you He will serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, God will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will accomplish something for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this we see that our speaking in the Spirit is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 12:1-3 Paul s intention is to impress us with the importance of speaking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, some saints have been deceived concerning the matter of functioning in the meetings and think that they are not gifted and therefore cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may consider a certain experienced brother in the Lord and say, This is one very gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through his years in the Lord, he has been equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there is no way I can be like him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, this way of thinking is a sign of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth is that we all can function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can at least exercise our spirit to say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can testify that when the saints exercise to speak in the meetings, it is much easier for me to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their speaking of the Lord stirs me up and inspires me to speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to speak in the meetings, and we all can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can call on the Lord Jesus, and we can speak concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, in 12:4-6 we have diverse distributions of gifts by the same Spirit v. 4 , diverse distributions of ministries by the same Lord v. 5 , and diverse distributions of operations by the same God, who is operating all things in all v. 6 . In 12:1-6 there are four parties.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We ourselves are the first party, and the other parties are the Spirit, the Lord, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have seen that when we exercise our spirit to speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a very real sense, we are crucial, and our part is a crucial part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit s functioning, the Lord s ministering, and God s operating require our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once again we see that we all need to speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have heard much concerning the Lord Jesus, God s salvation, grace, redemption, justification, sanctification, and many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we need to respond to what we have heard by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A genuine Christian is a speaking Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, we should speak not only in the meetings, but at home and on the way to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is possible that the Holy Spirit will be poured out through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may compare our speaking concerning the Lord to the striking of a small match.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that a single match can start a fire that will burn an entire building. therefore, we should not despise a little match.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a similar way, we should not despise our speaking, for it may cause many others to be set on fire in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be impressed with the fact that when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God works.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the Triune God dispensing His riches into us.</S>
