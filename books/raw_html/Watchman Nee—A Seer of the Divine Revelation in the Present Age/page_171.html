<P>The following is the testimony of Brother Hsu Jin-chin concerning one of the meetings:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>On February 9, I attended a meeting, and the word of the meeting greatly touched me. At the end of the meeting, I stood up and offered a prayer and consecrated myself with loud weeping and tears. I sang the hymn "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross." My whole being was filled with unspeakable joy. The attendance that evening was over two hundred. The meeting was originally scheduled to end at 9:30 in the evening. But after some had started to pray, the Holy Spirit continued to work, and over twenty people consecrated themselves one after another. The meeting went on until 10:45.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>As a result of this consecration, Brother Hsu and his wife wrote down the following declaration:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>February 9, 1950, 9:30 p.m.</P><P>To the gracious Lord who has loved us:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We thank You and praise You. Because of Your calling and mercy, we gladly offer up our bodies as living sacrifices, and we hand over our children, our job, our time, our future, and everything we have to Your hands. We will gladly serve You in coordination with all the brothers and sisters in the church. Accept us, and may Your grace and love be with us all. Amen.</P><P>Recipients of grace,<br>Hsu Jin-chin<br>Chao Lai-ying</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
