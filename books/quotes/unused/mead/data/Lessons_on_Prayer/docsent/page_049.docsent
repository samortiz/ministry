   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Anointing of the Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The anointing of the ointment is the anointing spoken of in 1 John chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament age, God comes to man as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit is not just the oil, but the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God comes to man to be the ointment moving within him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This moving is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First John 2:27 speaks not only of the Spirit being the ointment in us, but even more of the ointment anointing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the anointing of the ointment does not speak of the ointment itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it speaks of the anointing action of the ointment, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The continuous moving of the Spirit in us keeps us remaining in the fellowship of God and thus abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the anointing also maintains the fact of our being in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the first means by which fellowship is maintained is the cleansing of the blood, and the second is the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This precisely corresponds to the types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The types in the Old Testament show that when man desired to contact God and fellowship with God, he had to first sprinkle the blood and then apply the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When speaking of maintaining the fellowship, the New Testament brings up the matters of sprinkling the blood and applying the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sprinkling of the blood is to cleanse away all that should not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The anointing of the ointment is to anoint us with the elements of God, even with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is just like someone painting furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result of the painting action, the paint is applied to the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit coming to man is God coming to man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And by the Spirit moving and anointing in man, God is wrought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, on the negative side, the blood cleanses away all the things that we should not have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the positive side, the ointment anoints us with what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we should not have are the sins, and what we should have is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By the continual cleansing and anointing of the blood and the ointment, we maintain our union with the Lord always.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lamb and the Dove in John 1 are parallel to the blood and the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The blood is the Lamb, and the ointment is the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lamb denotes the Lord shedding His blood for us on the cross to take away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Dove denotes the Spirit coming to man to add the elements of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we must learn to constantly receive the blood for the cleansing of our sins and to move according to the anointing of the ointment within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On one hand, as soon as we sense we are wrong, we should immediately confess our mistake and receive the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, whenever the Spirit moves within us, we should immediately move according to the consciousness of that anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we abide and remain in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This should be our continuous and uninterrupted practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A LIFE OF ABIDING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christian life is a life of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you continuously abide in the Lord, your life will surely be holy, victorious, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every aspect of our Christian life is included in the life of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are several points in this living that we need to learn properly: A. Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To walk according to the Spirit is to walk according to the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have said that God comes to us as the ointment within us, always anointing us and giving us consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we walk according to this consciousness, we are walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, while you are speaking, if your inner consciousness prohibits you from going on, you ought to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If your inner consciousness urges you to take some action, you should obey it and take that particular action.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may be about to express a certain attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it seems that there is an inner feeling restraining you, then you should stop quickly and not express it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether in great things or small things, learn to follow the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To obey the inner consciousness is to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And to walk according to the Spirit is to obey the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to abide in the Lord according to the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Immediately following our salvation, we have the Spirit as the ointment anointing us and moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we inevitably have a consciousness of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our responsibility is to strictly take heed to that consciousness in the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not think or reason with your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you think, consider, argue, or analyze, you will surely come out of your spirit and no longer remain in the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your thoughts, your reasoning, and your natural insight can often interrupt your fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, pay no attention to them, but take care of the consciousness in the depths of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more you walk according to this consciousness, you will discover that you are more deeply abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And, simultaneously and spontaneously, your life will be one of abiding in the Lord.</S>
