<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF GOD THE SON TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>God the Son is also dispensing His divine riches into us (Eph. 1:7, 10-11). Based on the choosing and predestinating of God the Father, we have the redemption of God the Son.<h2 class=head2>Putting the Believers into Christ</h2><p>Although the Father chose and predestinated us, and gave us His life and nature, we became fallen in Adam. For this reason we need redemption. Without the redemption of the Son, even if the Father wanted to give us His life and nature, He could not do it. This is because on our side there is the problem of sin. Hence, God the Son came to accomplish redemption. He died for us, bore our sins away, and redeemed us. God also forgave us in Christ. Once a person believes in the Lord, he is redeemed and put into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Once he is in Christ, his sins are forgiven, death is over, and all of his problems are solved. This is the dispensing of the Son into us. This passage in Ephesians shows us a number of times that when we believe in the Lord, we are put into Christ. This is not superstition or empty terminology. Rather, it is a fact. He is the real One. He is the Spirit, the reality, and the grace. When we are in Him, we are in the reality and in grace. Hence, Christ becomes our sphere and our element. In this sphere we are protected, and in this element we enjoy all the divine benefits.<h2 class=head2>Having Christ as the Believers’ Element and Sphere, Being Made God’s Inheritance according to God’s Economy by the Divine Dispensing of His Divine Element</h2><p>There is a short song following Lesson 25 of the Life Lessons which says,<p class=hbody>I’m in Christ, now rejoicing— From old Adam I am free! All old things are becoming Both new and heavenly! Praise God! I’m tasting and enjoying Life and peace and liberty! Praise God! I’m in Christ eternally!<p>If every morning, afternoon, and evening and even before we go to bed, we would sing this song concerning our being in Christ, we will be victorious every day. While we sing, the Spirit will operate in us and bring us into the reality. In this way we will be in Christ, and Christ will become our sphere and element. With this divine element, God will make those who are in Christ His chosen inheritance. We are not only God’s redeemed ones in Christ, but His precious inheritance produced in Christ and with Christ as our sphere and element, so that God can inherit us. God has purchased us with the blood of His Son. Now we are in His Son, and His Son has become our sphere and our element. If we live in Christ every day, Christ will become our sphere and element, that is, the producing ingredient with which God will make us His inheritance. This is the dispensing of God the Son.<p>None of us can redeem ourselves, and none of us can become an encircling sphere and an element to make ourselves a precious inheritance to God. Only Christ Himself, God the Son, can dispense to us such a blessing so that He becomes our sphere to surround and protect us, and also our element for our daily enjoyment, so that day by day we may be made more and more precious and may become God’s precious inheritance. This is the dispensing of God the Son.
