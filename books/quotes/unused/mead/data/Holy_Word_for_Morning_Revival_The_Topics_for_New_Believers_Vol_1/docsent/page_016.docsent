   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Pet 2:2-3 As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 4:4 But He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Coming to the Word to "Taste" the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Peter 2:2-3 we have a most important passage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses are important to us because they tell us clearly how to taste the Lord: drink "the guileless pure milk of the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would taste Christ, we must take into us the milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will be nourished for spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Praise the Lord, the Bible says tasted!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not say that we know this aspect or that aspect about the Lord, but that we taste the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we drink the milk of the Word, we are actually tasting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the way for us to taste the Lord is simply by drinking the milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word is not only for us to study or learn, but even more for us to taste.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way the Lord nourishes His Body is by His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we desire to enjoy the Lord and be nourished by the Lord, we must come to the Word to taste the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the concept which most of us have of the Bible is that it is a kind of teaching, a book full of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, we come to the Word with the intention of understanding and knowing something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must not come to the Bible only to learn and to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible is not the tree of knowledge; it is the tree of life!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we take the Word of God as the tree of knowledge, we misuse the Bible, because 2 Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must never take the Bible as a book of letters, but as a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Main Function of the Bible to Impart God into Us as Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The main function of the Bible is to impart God into us as life and as the nourishment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not only to give us knowledge about God and His love, but to impart God Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we read the Bible, we should not merely try to know or understand it, but take something of God's essence into us just as we take our food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, like food, this substance will be assimilated into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Scriptures contain at least three examples of those who ate the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first is Jeremiah, who said, "Your words were found and I ate them" Jer 15:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To eat something is not merely to receive it, but to assimilate it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To assimilate is to receive something into you, digest it, and make it a part of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second example of someone eating the Word of God is recorded in the book of Ezekiel, where the prophet Ezekiel ate the Word of God 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jeremiah said, "Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart" Jer 15:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a kind of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Word, after being eaten, became a joy and also a gladness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's Word is an enjoyment; after it is taken into us and assimilated into our very being, it becomes joy within us and gladness without.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the third example , David said, "How sweet are Your words to my taste!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>/ Sweeter than honey to my mouth!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psa 119:103 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Word is indeed an enjoyment; it is even sweeter and more pleasant than honey to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From these verses we realize that the Word of God is not only for us to learn, but even more for us to taste, to eat, to enjoy, and to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus even speaks of God's Word as spiritual food: "It is written, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'" Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every word which proceeds out of the mouth of God is spiritual food to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the food by which we must live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>68</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
