<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. FOR THE ANOINTING OF THE THINGS<br>RELATED TO THE WORSHIP AND SERVICE OF GOD<br>AND HIS SERVING ONES, TYPIFIED BY<br>THE TABERNACLE AND ITS UTENSILS<br>AND THE SERVING PRIESTS</H2><P>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 was used to anoint the tabernacle, all the utensils of the tabernacle, and the serving priests to make all these things holy, separated, sanctified, unto God for God's divine purpose (vv. 26-30). This indicates that everything related to the divine field must be anointed by the compound Spirit. The compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment is for the anointing of the things related to the worship and service of God and His serving ones (1 John 2:20, 27). When we are under the anointing of the Spirit, we can fulfill our duty to bear responsibility for the Lord's interest.</P><P>When we were saved, that was the beginning of our experience of the anointing by the compound Spirit. First, the Spirit came to inspire us to repent. He separated us from the common people so that we would come to Jesus. We were attracted by Jesus, we called on His name, and we believed into Him to be regenerated by the Spirit. After regeneration, we pass through the steps of sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification. All of these are steps of the anointing.</P><P>First John 2:20 and 27 say that we have received the anointing of the Lord. Now we have to abide in the Lord according to this anointing. We have to walk, act, work, and have our being according to this anointing. This anointing is the working and the moving of the Spirit. Thus, Romans 8:4 says that we should walk according to the spirit. Then in Galatians 5 we are told to live and walk by the Spirit (vv. 16, 25). If we do not know this Spirit, how can we live the Christian life? It would be impossible.</P><P>Now we all have to ask where this compound Spirit is today. The New Testament reveals clearly and emphasizes very strongly that such a consummated Spirit is right in our spirit. Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. Second Timothy 4:22 reveals that the Lord as the Spirit is with our spirit. If we are going to live the Christian life, we must return to our spirit and remain there.</P><P>In our Christian life, we do not need to wait to hear a voice from the heavens. The experience of the compound Spirit is mysterious yet very normal. He is within us, but often we have no feeling that He is within us. However, whether we sense Him or not, He is in our spirit. Thus, we have to stay, to remain, in our spirit. Then we will walk, act, work, and speak according to the spirit. The spirit referred to in Romans 8 is actually a mingled spirit, the compound Spirit mingled with our human spirit.</P><P>It is by this compound Spirit that the death of Christ is applied to us. It is also by this Spirit that the resurrection of Christ is applied to us. The more we walk, live, move, act, and speak according to the spirit, the more we are in the Christian life. Some may say that Christ is life, but they cannot tell others how Christ can be life to them. The messages in this series on the Christian life show us how Christ as life can be applied to us.</P>
