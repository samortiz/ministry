<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE DIVINE TITLES OF GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Among the Many Titles for God<br>in the Old Testament, Only Three Being<br>Primarily Used&#151;Elohim, Jehovah, and Adonai</H2><P>Elohim, Jehovah, and Adonai are the three major, divine titles used for God in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Elohim</H2><P>Elohim, a plural noun in Hebrew, implies the notions of the strong One and faithfulness, hence, the faithful, strong One. Our God is strong and faithful. He is strong in strength and faithful in word. Whatever He does, shows forth His strength. Whatever He says, He will keep. He is the strong, faithful One. Elohim is a uni-plural noun. The plurality of the word Elohim implies the Divine Trinity (Gen. 1:26a; 3:22a; 11:7a; Isa. 6:8a; John 17:11b, 22b; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). This title, denoting the unique yet triune God, is used more than two thousand five hundred times in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah</H2><P>Jehovah is another divine title of God (Gen. 2:4), literally meaning "He that is who He is, therefore the eternal I AM." This title primarily denotes "the self-existent and ever- existent One" (Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:24b, 28a, 58; Rev. 1:4, 8). As Jehovah, He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who is to come in the future. Revelation 1:4 speaks of "Him who is and who was and who is coming." In the past He was; in the present He is; and in the future He is to be. He is the great I AM. The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins" (John 8:24b). Eventually, they asked Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" Jesus responded, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" (vv. 57-58). The Lord Jesus is the great I AM in every age. He is everything. Whatever we need, He is. He is our Savior, our Redeemer, our sight, our ability, our capacity, our light, our life, our righteousness, our holiness, and our kindness. He is thousands of items to us because He is everything and He is in every time.</P><P>When Moses was called by God, Moses asked Him what His name was. Exodus 3:13 and 14 say, "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." As the I AM, He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#151;the threefold yet unique and one God (v. 15). In His person there is the Father like Abraham, the Son like Isaac, and the third One like Jacob. He is threefold, yet one unique God.</P>
