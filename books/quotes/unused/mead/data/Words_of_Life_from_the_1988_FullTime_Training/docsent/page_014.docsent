   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR TO KNOW THE POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST S RESURRECTION 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10; Eph 1:18-20a; Acts 2:23-24; Rom 6:9; 8:11; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 4:10-12; Rom 6:4-5; 8:13b THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE BIBLE DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we have quoted many verses from the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They all contain a basic principle of the truths in the Bible, that is, death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the universe, from the viewpoint of God s economy, God has two creations: one is the natural creation which is the old creation; the other is the resurrected creation which is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s natural creation came about through His speaking; He called things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God speaks, things come into being; when God commands, things come into order Psa 33:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Originally, there was nothing; but when God spoke, things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God did not use any resources; God only used His speaking to call things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This natural creation of God is just temporary, not eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is something that God used as a means and an instrument to arrive at another creation, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new creation is accomplished by the old creation passing through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our salvation as believers is an example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were originally men of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God created Adam, millions of men, including you and I, were included in this Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we believed into the Lord and were organically joined to Him, we were in Him and were crucified with Him; moreover, through the power of God s life, we were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dying with Him causes us to be delivered from the old creation of Adam; living with Him causes us to enter into the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the death and resurrection revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD S DESIRE BEING FOR US TO BECOME</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not want anything of the old creation; God only wants the new creation transformed from the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why in the Bible God usually does not care for the first but for the second.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many examples of this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For instance, God did not want Abraham s first son Ishmael, but his second son Isaac Gen 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaac s first son Esau was hated by God, while the second son Jacob was loved by God Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, Hebrews 8:7 says, For if that first covenant was faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first covenant here refers to the old covenant, and the second covenant refers to the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In saying new, He has made the first old.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing v. 13 . All these speak of the biblical truth concerning death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true with our human birth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our first birth was of man, natural, and of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second birth was of God; it happened when we were saved and regenerated, and is of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, God does not want anything that we do by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only does He not want the bad; even the good He rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God only wants what we do by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not want anything natural; God only wants what is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God does not want anything of the old creation; God only wants what is of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first two chapters of the Bible show us the first creation, the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last two chapters show us the second creation, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 21:1 says, And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, the new heaven and new earth come about by the old heaven and old earth passing through the burning, renewing, and transforming work of God s fire of judgment 2 Pet 3:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is similar to the new man being formed by the old man being renewed and transformed Col 3:9-10; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this you can see that there is a basic principle in the Bible: whatever is of the old creation will have to pass through death and resurrection to become the new creation.</S>
