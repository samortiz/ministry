   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN BUILDING UP THE GROUP MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AND DEFINITELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous messages we have seen that the church service is primarily composed of five main things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first item is the proper gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, we must study the truth and seek after the truth; we must have a thorough knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, there is the need of the adequate growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fourth, there must be a strong children s work built up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fifth, our church service must include the student work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our work among the young people includes the elementary, junior high, high school, and college-age levels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our church service, then, must consist of the gospel, the truth, life, the children s work, and the student work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among us, not one of these basic aspects of church service has adequately been built up because our church practice was too general and too much in tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been holding on to our old ways and practices year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT GENERAL BUT PARTICULAR</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must all pick up a definite burden to be the New Testament priests of the gospel to take the Lord s new way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we begin to practice the Lord s new way, we should not carry it out in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we must consider that this is a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, when we attend school, we enroll in a particular field of study.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot study a particular field according to our knowledge, our way, our likes or dislikes, or our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we pursue a course of study according to the school s regulations and instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If so, we will receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may consider the practice of the new way as our enrollment into a new school.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must forget about all the old ways in the church life and not take anything for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do mean business with the Lord to take the God-ordained new way, we should practice it regularly and consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to not do too much or too little, but we must have a schedule; we must have a particular schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would be very helpful if we would make a definite decision and pray, Lord, for Your new way I offer to You three hours of my time per week, either in the afternoon or evening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To some extent we all should have done this already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LABORING CONSISTENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not necessary for the older saints among us, particularly the older sisters, to go out too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They can stay at home to pray for the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sisters should pray, Lord, I give You three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I cannot go out that often, but I do have a burden to pray for the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only so, the sisters should pray for a particular team.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way they become co-laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While the team labors in going out, the sisters stay at home and labor in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every week the sisters should keep their vow before the Lord to separate at least two or three hours for the purpose of praying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must pray particularly, definitely, and regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of us know that students at school must learn to study in a regular way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No student can successfully finish his schooling by studying one night until midnight and not studying at all for the next few days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He needs to receive the proper instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, he must faithfully do his homework for two hours each day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By studying a few hours a day in a regular way, he will surely be a top student.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who go out to visit people should go in a regular way, according to their vow to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should make this a kind of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the descendants of Adam, we are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day our wife may make us very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Due to this we are more than excited to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We pray and become filled with the Spirit and go out rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another day we decide to go out visiting, but a few minutes before we go, our wife does something to make us unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So we decide not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether we are happy or unhappy, up or down, we must endeavor to keep our vow to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No appointment, friends, telephone calls, or even the weather should stop us from going out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are not consistent in our going out, our labor will never be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must have an attitude that we will not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not gain anyone this week, then we will go out next week just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A carpenter who does his carpentry work in a regular way will soon produce a coffee table or a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, with many of the dear saints, their good reports and testimonies are like pieces of wood piled up, but where is the furniture?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no need to baptize too many.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to baptize only four or five the whole year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, every week we must have two or three newly-baptized ones under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This should be our practice all year.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then, as in rearing our own children, we can teach them particularly and regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Unless we practice the new way regularly, the Lord has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our going out must be in a discerning way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should discern whether to visit our relatives first, our neighbors, or our classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we have some warm doors, there is no need to approach the cold doors.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After we enter their home and have a chance to talk, we should exercise our discernment to determine whether or not to spend more time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not baptize in a blind way, and we need not baptize too many.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Within one month s time, by going out once a week for three hours, we can baptize two.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After baptizing them, we must consider them as our babes because we are the delivering mother.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Following this we must cherish them and nourish them by going back to hold regular meetings with them in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way surely one or two will be ready to be brought to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although at the beginning they may not understand that much, we should let them taste a little bit of what the church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Meanwhile, we should explain things and give them some instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By taking care of them in this way all year, two saints will be produced by our work and brought into the church life each year.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then everyone will bring two definite, remaining fruit into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In a church of two hundred forty saints, four hundred will be meeting together after one year.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must take care of the new ones starting with the home meeting, then passing through the group meeting, and perhaps after one year reaching the prophesying meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will train them to do the same thing as we do, that is, to go out to visit people with the gospel to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They will just repeat our work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is to be perfected unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then we will see the growth and increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must change our concept and see that we do not need to labor that much.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Every morning we should spend a short time with the Lord to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must practice this every morning regardless of how busy we are.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We can spend at least half a minute in the morning with the Lord and say, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Be with me for this whole day, and bless whatever I do for You.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Yes, this is too short.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But to say this makes us quite different from when we do not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even in this way we will be revived for that entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>By living with the Lord, we will enjoy a daily victory.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is no need to worry or be that burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>By practicing this according to the trained way, we will bear solid, remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must be practical, definite, particular, and regular.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>THE EXERCISE OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>TO BE DEFINITE AND PARTICULAR</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The elders in the church must especially exercise themselves that the Lord may lead them to pick up a particular part in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They should not do things independently of the Body, but in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>For example, concerning the group meetings, one among the elders may pick up a burden to build up a new small group or an existing group.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>First, the elders must learn how to bring that group particularly into the new way and on the right track by the proper steps.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They must render definite help.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To labor in a general way is just a waste of time; that will not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It all depends upon our understanding and determination.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we do mean business to serve the Lord with some success, we must learn to labor particularly and regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should not exhaust ourselves one day and then do nothing for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not be influenced or affected by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Rather, we should be definite, particular, and regular.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In doing anything, we must do it in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must do things according to what we have learned through training.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We have to take the building up of our group meeting as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must build up our group meeting, starting from knocking on doors and getting people baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Then, we can go on to have home meetings with the newly-saved and baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Following this, we must build up a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Maybe one-third of the saints in the church actively participate in the Lord s new move, leaving two-thirds who are still not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Because of this we must endeavor to bring them in one by one in a gradual way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should not do too much at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We may be burdened to contact a certain saint, but we have to discern if this is the best time for us to contact him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We must always do things with the proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Gradually, after one month s time we may bring one saint into our group meeting who has not been meeting in one of our small groups before.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we would just be faithful to do this, in one year one person could bring eight to ten dormant saints into the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If ten of us would do the same thing, then by the end of the next year, everyone would be in a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Ten of us could bring in eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>It is not too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We may say that it is difficult for us to bring one existing saint into the group meeting every month.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>However, we can surely bring one saint into a group meeting within three months.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>So, within one year we could still bring in four.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If eighty active saints would each bring in four, then in one year s time, three hundred twenty saints will be brought into these groups.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In the eldership, everything must be carried out in a particular way; everything must be definite.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Among the sisters there may be no particular arrangements made to prepare the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If so, when the Lord s Day comes, there may be no bread and wine for the saints to partake of.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The sisters who prepare the bread and cup must be regular.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Whether they have a difficult time with their husband or not, it should not change anything.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>They must do their duty regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If we all hold this kind of attitude with such a proper spirit, we will succeed in our labor and service to the Lord.</S>
