   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CARRYING OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY A REVIVED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to fellowship more concerning how to carry out the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, I want to point out some crucial items of revelation which were released in the summer training of 1987.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY TO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the summer training of 1987, I shared nineteen messages which are contained in the book entitled The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A number of these messages are crucial in revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first chapter of this book is concerning the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In that chapter there is one point which I never released in the previous years of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That point is concerning the completion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The record of the completion of Christ is in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in the Acts, this completed Christ was propagated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Christ is eternally perfect, but such an eternally perfect Christ needed to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today our Savior is the completed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has been completed in incarnation, in human living, in crucifixion, in resurrection, in becoming the essential Spirit of life, in ascension, and in becoming the economical Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I also consider the last three chapters of this book to be very critical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These three chapters are entitled "The Apostles' Teaching and Fellowship," "The New Testament Ministry and Ministers," and "The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry and among the New Testament Ministers."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the New Testament record, the leadership is in the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things from God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Timothy shows us that there was some leadership that charged people to teach the proper thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that the proper leadership is in the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE APPLICATION OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BY A REVIVED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning the application of the God-ordained way, the biblical way, the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To know this way outwardly is not that difficult, but to apply the biblical way to meet and to serve is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This biblical way includes four things: 1 the preaching of the gospel by visiting people to get people saved for Christ Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15 ; 2 having home meetings set up in the new ones' homes for nourishing and cherishing them that they may grow in life John 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2 ; 3 having group meetings to group the new ones together for perfecting Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12-13 ; and 4 prophesying, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-24, 31, 39a .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>None of these four items is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the first step of visiting people to get them saved is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we must be revived persons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be stirred up in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be praying persons who pray ourselves into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then when we are in the light, we can make a thorough confession of all our sinfulness, defects, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the entire day we have to walk in the spirit and we have to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also must learn to speak Christ all day long to anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then this will qualify us to be the right persons to go out, not merely with a doctrinal gospel but with the living person of Christ.</S>
