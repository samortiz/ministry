   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE BEING NEITHER GOOD MEN NOR EVIL MEN BUT GOD-MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 2:19 says, "I have died to law that I might live to God."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the requirement of the law upon us as sinners is that we should die and that according to that requirement Christ died for us; hence, our obligation under the law, our relationship with the law, was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This makes it possible for us to live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOOD MEN AND EVIL MEN BOTH LIVING TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Gentiles, however, who do not believe in God and do not have God, still live to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They live to the law because they do not have God, just as those who do not have a car have no choice but to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to not knowing God and not having God, they have the evil power of Satan within them that incites them to sin and to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They know that they ought to do good and to stay away from evil, so naturally they establish certain rules and determine principles for human conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although they do not have God and even have Satan within them, as human beings they still have a desire to be good and to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this contradictory situation certainly they will live under the law and attempt to keep the various principles of human conduct under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their hope is to be successful in their attempts to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not think about God; rather, their thoughts are altogether on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their practice is most displeasing to God because it puts God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their attempts to keep the law in order to be virtuous, well-behaved, and good people, the unbelievers act by themselves and thus put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not acknowledge that there is God they deny the existence of God, yet they try to maintain a high standard of conduct by being very careful in their speech and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way they put God aside, conducting themselves and trying to do good by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as those who sin and do evil, such as robbers, swindlers, and extortioners, are without God and put God aside, so those who are proper, upright, and well-behaved can also be without God and put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows us that some people have fallen into evil and thus have put God aside, while others have fallen into good and thus have also put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our society there are these two categories of people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One category consists of those who are capable of committing every crime under the sun, including being treacherous, cruel, deceitful, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no doubt that such ones have put God aside and that God has no place in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other category consists of people who are well-behaved, who conduct themselves properly, who are trustworthy, and who possess high morality yet at the same time vehemently deny the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such ones have also put God aside, and God has no place in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DOING GOOD AND DOING EVIL BOTH BEING RELATED TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, there are two different kinds of people: one kind does evil, and the other kind does good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to good and evil, these two kinds of people are absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet in the matter of putting God aside and not giving God any place, they are absolutely the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as those who do evil put God aside, so those who do good also put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as those who do evil do not give God any room, so those who do good also do not give God any room.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two kinds of people behave differently one does good and the other does evil; nevertheless, they have exactly the same kind of attitude toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who do evil give up the law, thereby rejecting God, and those who do good keep the law, thereby also rejecting God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The former forsake God by violating the law, while the latter forsake God by observing the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both groups of people have problems because of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first group of people gives up God because they have broken the law, whereas the second group forsakes God because they consider that they have kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we can see that both these conditions of rejecting God are related to the law.</S>
