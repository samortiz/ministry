   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GEHENNA OF FIRE IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1 through 7 are the general words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will just mention them briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to pay more attention to the words beginning in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus expanded on this matter to point out that it is not only wrong to stumble others, but it is a serious and grave matter even to stumble yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 8 says, "If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Who does "you" refer to here?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 3 through 7, "you" refers to the disciples who asked the question in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Lord Jesus answered them, He told them to be watchful and not to stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's words in verse 8 are directed at the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a hand or a foot stumbles you, it is better to cut it off and cast it away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, this need not be taken literally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If your hands steal and your feet walk in improper paths, that is, if there is sin and lust in you, you must deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire" v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord shows us that if Christians tolerate sin, they will suffer either the casting into the eternal fire with both hands and both feet, or the entering into life with one hand or one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us clearly that there are those who deal with their sins and lusts in this age and who will enter into the kingdom with one hand or one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are also those who will leave their lusts unchecked and will be cast into the eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fire is an eternal fire, but it does not say that they will remain in the eternal fire forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What the Lord Jesus did not say is as significant as what He did say.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person has become a Christian but his hands or feet sin all the time, he will suffer the punishment of the eternal fire in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will not suffer this punishment eternally, but will suffer it only in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does it mean to cut off a hand or a foot?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a man cuts off his hand or foot, he can still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he does not have a foot, he can travel by car.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one of his hands is cut off, he can still sin with the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not necessarily the Lord's intention that we cut off a hand or foot, for even if we do cut off a hand, we still cannot remove our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, this word must not refer to the outward body, but to the inward lust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we have to cut off is that which drives us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another thing that we have to realize is that the person spoken of here must be a Christian, for only a Christian is clean in his body as a whole and can thus enter into life after dealing with his lust in a single member of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It would not be enough for the unbelievers to cut off a hand or a foot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if they were to cut off both hands and both feet, they would still have to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to enter the kingdom of the heavens, it is better for a Christian to have an incomplete body than to go into eternal fire because of incomplete dealing.</S>
