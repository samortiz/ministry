 THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Although fellowship involves two parties, God and man, fellowship is God&rsquo;s demand, not man&rsquo;s. During fellowship our sentiments should be mingled with God&rsquo;s sentiments, and our preferences should be mingled with His preferences. During fellowship our mind, emotion, and will should be mingled with God. If we want to fellowship with God, we must be prepared to lose ourselves in Him. Otherwise, our preferences and desires will remain separate from His preferences and desires. Even though our preferences and desires may not be bad, we and God will still be two separate entities, and we will not have fellowship.</p>
<p>The principle of fellowship is that man and God become one, are mingled as one. This mingling is not a matter of God being lost in man but of man being lost in God. Man cannot ask God to change, because fellowship is not man&rsquo;s requirement; it is God&rsquo;s demand, His seeking an outlet. Hence, fellowship requires that man be lost in God. The highest price of consecration is for man to be fully lost in God during fellowship. In genuine fellowship man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will are fully surrendered to God and completely lost in Him. Fellowship is a severe demand. If we do not surrender, we will not have fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The three points mentioned above are the basic conditions for fellowship. If we know these conditions, it will be easy for us to fellowship. In addition, we also need to practice.</p>
<p>First, we cannot fellowship with God and touch Him in the physical realm or in our mind, because He dwells in our spirit. We must learn to turn to our spirit and fellowship with God according to the sense in the depths of our being.</p>
<p>Second, we must set aside time. During this time we need to drop outward affairs and put aside our thoughts so that we can fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Third, when we fellowship, we should set aside our demands. We should even stop our prayer, because fellowship is for God&rsquo;s demands, not ours. During fellowship we can respond only to God&rsquo;s demand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In conclusion, fellowship is God&rsquo;s demand, and it is a severe demand. Fellowship requires that our mind, emotion, and will be fully surrendered to God, and it requires that we pay the price. This price is not according to what we want to pay, for such a price is worthless to God. Our paying the price is precious and valuable to God when it is according to what He requires of us. We often feel that it is difficult to pay a price and that we cannot do it. However, it is not that we cannot pay the price but that we are unwilling to pay the price. When we respond to God&rsquo;s demand, we will have fellowship, but if we are unwilling to submit to His demand, we will be unable to touch Him.</p>
<p>After Abraham took Hagar as his wife, he did not have God&rsquo;s appearing or God&rsquo;s revelation for thirteen years (Gen. 16:16&mdash;17:1). Abraham was in darkness because he did not have fellowship with God. In Song of Songs 5 the beloved asked his lover for fellowship, but she ignored him and would not answer his request for fellowship. Later when she rose up to seek her beloved, she searched for him and could not find him, because he had hidden himself (vv. 2-6). This was her beloved&rsquo;s disciplining her.</p>
<p>For those who love the Lord and pursue Him, being unable to touch the Lord or to have His presence is a painful experience. The Lord uses this experience to discipline those who love Him but are unwilling to pay the price so that later they dare not refuse His demand. This discipline is temporary; it is not permanent. After thirteen years God appeared to Abraham again and fellowshipped with him. God disciplines us in order to restore our fellowship with Him. May the Lord have mercy upon us so that we would be those who respond to His demands and live in fellowship and thus be totally lost in Him. The future of the church depends on our being this kind of people.</p>
<p>In Christianity there are messages about fearing God and worshipping Him, but seldom is there a message on surrendering to God and being lost in Him. For this reason, God cannot find an outlet. The situation in Christianity can be compared to respecting one&rsquo;s father yet being unwilling to submit to him in a certain matter. Madame Guyon once said that the greatest miracle in the universe is a person who is willing to offer himself unreservedly to God. This also applies to a Christian who is willing to live in fellowship and to surrender himself to God. God&rsquo;s outlet on the earth depends on such ones.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
