   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN A DISTRICT Not Acting according to Emotions</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The responsible ones in a district should work like a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is especially true in their coordination with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to function like a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot work according to your own emotions, preference, or temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a responsible one in a district, you cannot work according to your own likes, preferences, or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to be like a machine, running or stopping according to the on-off switch, not according to your own likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as the switch turns on, you operate mechanically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church we do not want anyone to do anything out of a good heart or out of his own zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person acts according to his emotion, he is like a thermometer that has no calibration at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Parents cannot stop feeding and clothing their children just because they misbehave.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you deal with your children according to just your emotion, you are not qualified to be a parent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people scorch others when they are zealous but put others into the freezer when they are cold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose Brother Nee has a cook who acts according to his own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our brother wants noodles, the cook serves porridge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What can he do to such a cook except discharge him?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a cook can only be a master; he can never be a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man acts according to his emotion, he will damage others when he is emotionally high, and he will damage others when he is emotionally low.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have to go to the Lord all the time to find out how much you love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to say to Him, "Lord, I am willing to put my temperament, preference, and emotions on the altar."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When children provoke their parents to anger, the parents often consider giving up on their children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But they are compelled to go on because they love their children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to be brought to the point where we work all the time, whether or not we like it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do it because the Lord loves us and because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we work only when we feel like working, we are like an unreliable thermometer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others will not know what clothes to wear when they read us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One passage in the Old Testament touches me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Aaron's two sons died before the Lord because they offered strange fire, Moses ordered Aaron not to mourn Lev 10:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses was a faithful servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Aaron also knew God very well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their work was to serve God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God required that they not mix their own personal affections with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God says that no one should mourn, no one can mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if a person wants to cry, he can only swallow his tears.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever you have to do, you should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot overstretch your hands when you feel like it or stop working when you do not feel like it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your likes and dislikes should not affect the way you work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let emotions rise and fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the Lord's grace in us, we can continue with our work all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rejecting Natural Affections</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The responsible ones in a district should also be on the alert against the encroachment of natural affections; they should guard against acting by their own emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among the brothers and sisters, they should only exercise a love that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should not develop any natural affection through their service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more divine love there is, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Natural affection must be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Two people become friends through working together and developing an affinity for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church we should condemn natural affection; it is something loathsome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some good brothers and sisters have fallen by the wayside just because they were not careful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Natural affection can kill the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament God ordained that the meal offering must be free from honey Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Both leaven and honey kill the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brother Chao Ching-hwai and I have been coordinating with each other for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During those years, except for the purpose of discussing spiritual work and meeting various needs related to our service, I never visited his home.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was afraid that human love would be mixed in with our love in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to maintain the boundary that the Lord has laid down, I even went out of my way to guard against visiting his home.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I can testify that we only maintain a divine love in the Lord; we have not developed a natural affection outside the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today many brothers and sisters get into trouble when they develop some affections through living together or coordinating together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must have much spiritual fellowship, but we should guard against pitfalls.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Watchman Nee: Christians have no friendships; they only have brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their relationships with each other are brotherly relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever we fall from a brotherly relationship to friends, our Christian life is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The New Testament contains all kinds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It speaks of relationships between masters and slaves, parents and children, and husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But it does not say anything about friendships.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the most peculiar thing about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You can have only worldly friends, not spiritual friends.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should replace our friends in the world with brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our contact with each other should only be in the form of coordination, service, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not have any other kind of unnecessary contact.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord charges us to love one another as He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should lay down our lives for our brothers cf.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>John 15:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This love transcends any kind of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The love we experience in our coordination is beyond any kind of human love.</S>
