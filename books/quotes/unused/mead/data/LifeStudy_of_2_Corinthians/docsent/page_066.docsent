   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE ESSENCE OF THE NEW COVENANT MINISTRY 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6-9, 18; 4:1a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The title of this message is The Essence of the New Covenant Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word essence is related to what Paul says concerning the glory and superiority of the ministry of the new covenant in 3:7-11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The former was through glory temporarily; the latter remains in glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2:12-17 the apostle speaks of the triumph and effect of the apostolic ministry; in 3:1-6, of its function and competency; and in 3:7-11, of its glory and superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In previous messages we have covered a number of basic points related to the new covenant ministry: the essence, the effect, the function, the competency, the glory, and the superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now in this message we need to consider the essence of the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>INSCRIBED WITH THE SPIRIT AS AN ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may point out that the word essence is not found in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although this word is not used here, the concept of essence is nonetheless implied in verse 3: Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse the word ministered actually means served.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek word means to serve something to someone, for example, as a waiter serves in a restaurant or a stewardess on an airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, Paul is saying that the Corinthian believers are a letter of Christ served by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, realizing that the word serve is not adequate, Paul went on to use the word inscribed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This explains the meaning of ministered, served.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s way of ministering was by inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 3:3 Paul says inscribed not with ink ; he does not say inscribed not by ink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word with indicates that the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence, an element, used by the one doing the inscribing or the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is important that we pay careful attention to Paul s use of the preposition with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This preposition indicates that the Spirit is neither the writer nor the instrument used for writing; rather, the Spirit is the essence, the element, the substance, used in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, such as a pen, but an element, the heavenly ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us take as an illustration the simple matter of writing a letter with a ball point pen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may be the writer, but the pen is the instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ink, however, is neither the writer nor the instrument it is the element, the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if your pen is out of ink, any writing you try to do with it will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may write words on paper, but the paper will be blank.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In such a case, there would be a writer and an instrument, but there would not be any ink as the necessary writing essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 the Holy Spirit is not the writer, the instrument, or even the power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When many Christians today talk about the Spirit, their concept is related to power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we read this verse carefully, considering it in its context, we shall see that the Spirit here is a matter of essence, not of power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because many Christians neglect the Spirit as an essence, I purposely emphasize the word essence in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What Christians today consider the Spirit as an essence?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the most part, Christians think of the Spirit as an instrument or as a power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others go farther and speak of the Spirit as a divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I do not know of any preachers who speak of the Spirit the way Paul does in 2 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul s view of the Spirit in this chapter was that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here he does not view the Spirit as a person, an instrument, or a power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, the Spirit is the essence used for inscribing living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ministry of the new covenant is not that of mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>None of your teachers in school ever inscribed an essence into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They may have put concepts into you, but they did not deposit the essence of anything into you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the new covenant ministry does more than merely teach us; it inscribes us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, this new covenant ministry inscribes us not with concepts, knowledge, or theology, but with an essence, with something real and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church life in the Lord s recovery, do you not have the sense that you are under a spiritual inscribing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many of us can testify that through the new covenant ministry Christ has been inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A divine essence has been written into our being, and this essence is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we still need to define what this essence is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We realize we have been inscribed with the Spirit, but what is this Spirit?</S>
