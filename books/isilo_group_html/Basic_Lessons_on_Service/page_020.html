We do not want to explain what it means to remember the Lord but to say something about the practice of remembering the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. REMEMBERING THE LORD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Praising instead of by Praying</H2><P>To remember the Lord (1 Cor. 11:24-25) we have to praise Him, not pray to Him. Remembering the Lord at His table is by praising instead of by praying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not to Ask the Lord to Do Things for Us</H2><P>We do not come to the Lord's table meeting to ask the Lord to do things for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. But to Bless the Lord with Well-speaking<br>concerning His Person and Work</H2><P>At the Lord's table meeting, we should bless the Lord with well-speaking concerning His person and work. Well-speaking means praising by speaking the good things. Here we need to use Revelation 5:13 as a reference: "And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever."</P><P>We have to impress the saints that it is altogether not fitting to pray to the Lord at the Lord's table when we are remembering Him. Instead, we have to praise Him, to bless Him, to speak well about Him concerning His person. It would be helpful to itemize some of the main points concerning His person, such as His divinity, His humanity, and His statuses as the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Savior, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier, the life-giving Spirit, the Lord, etc. We have to try the best to point out the different items of the Lord's person so that the saints can be helped in their praising. Then we also have to point out the various aspects of the Lord's work, such as His redemptive work, His saving work, His sanctifying work, His transforming work, etc. We have to bless the Lord in such a way as to praise Him, to speak well about Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
