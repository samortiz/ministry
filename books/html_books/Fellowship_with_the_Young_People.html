In this chapter we shall see their need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ together. In the next chapter we shall consider the vision of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Finally, in the last chapter we shall fellowship concerning four strategic points: the life experiences, the divine Spirit and our human spirit, reading the Word and the messages, and the matter of giving in God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>GOD CALLING THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT HIS MOVE</h2><p>It is so good to be young persons in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. In every age and generation God has come to the young people for the carrying out of His move. Both the Bible and church history show us that God wants to use the young people. We may say that Adam was very young when God was with him because he had just been created. Abel, the second generation of man in the line of life, was probably also young when he offered sacrifices to the Lord (Gen. 4:2, 4). Enoch was young when he began to walk in God&#8217;s presence. He was sixty-five years old when he began to walk with God, but at his time a man who was sixty-five years old was still young. He walked with God for three hundred years, and God took him at the age of three hundred sixty-five (Gen. 5:21-22).<p>Abraham also was called when he was a young man. You may point out that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he was called by God (Gen. 12:1-4). But if you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that Abraham was seventy-five years old when his father Terah died in Haran (Gen. 11:32). Acts 7:2 tells us that &#8220;the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran.&#8221; The first time God called Abraham was while his father was still alive, and the second call came after his father had died. Therefore, the first time God came to Abraham was much earlier than when he was seventy-five years of age. Furthermore, we have to realize that at Abraham&#8217;s time, a man who was seventy-five years old was still quite young. Moses was called by God and began to serve Him when he was eighty years old, but his preparation for service began when he was a small boy being nursed by his mother. At the age of eighty Moses &#8220;graduated&#8221; from a period of training by God, but he was called into this training when he was very young. Samuel was a very young boy when he was caught by God (1 Sam. 2:18). David also was a young man when he was anointed to be king (1 Sam. 16:11-13). Likewise, Daniel was young when he was an overcomer in the palace of the king of Babylon (Dan. 1:4, 17).<p>In the New Testament, none of the apostles whom Jesus called was an old man. They all were young people. When the Lord walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee, He called the young people. Zebedee was with his two sons, John and James, but the Lord called only the sons and not Zebedee (Matt. 4:21-22). It was God&#8217;s divine way and economy to call the sons and not the father. The elders in the first church on the earth, the church in Jerusalem, were young people.<p>The Bible also tells us that Timothy became an apostle (1 Thes. 1:1; cf. 2:6) as a young man to carry on the Lord&#8217;s testimony. In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul wrote, &#8220;Flee youthful lusts.&#8221; This indicates that the receiver of that Epistle was still a young man. I am happy that I was called by God when I was a teenager. All those who were in the initial stage of the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the proper church life over fifty years ago were young people in their twenties. Very few were over twenty-five. Most were either in high school or in college.<h2 class=head1>BEING CAUGHT AND OCCUPIED BY GOD</h2><p>The goal of Satan, God&#8217;s enemy, is to spoil and occupy mankind. The Lord comes to the young people for His move because the older people are, the more they are likely to be spoiled and preoccupied. The younger one is, the less he is likely to be spoiled and preoccupied. In 2 Timothy 3:1-4 Paul says, &#8220;But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come; for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money... nonlovers of good...lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.&#8221; The difficult times spoken of in these verses are the times when mankind is thoroughly spoiled and fully occupied by Satan.<p>Second Timothy 3:1-4 speaks of lovers of self, lovers of money, and lovers of pleasure. At the time Paul wrote his second Epistle to Timothy the Roman Empire was fully corrupted. Certain scholars have compared the situation in the United States since the 1950s to the situation of the Roman Empire in the first century. In principle, whatever evil thing is here with us today was also there in the first century. Today throughout the whole earth, young people are lovers of pleasure. Sports, amusements, and entertainment are simply pleasures. Likewise, at the end of the first century, the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, people were hunting for pleasures. They had invented new pleasures. In a sense, the pleasures in America today are not new. We simply have a repetition of history. History tells us that the fall of the Roman Empire was mostly due to the seeking for pleasure. Much immorality came out of the hunt for pleasure. That ruined the Roman Empire.<p>Paul told Timothy to be aware that difficult times would come when men would be lovers of self. History tells us that at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, the Romans were self-lovers. They did not care for anyone but themselves. Of course, they were also lovers of money. Self, money, and pleasure always go together. Where self is, money is loved and pleasures are sought. Men in this condition are fully spoiled and occupied with something other than God. They are lovers of themselves, of money, and of pleasures, but not lovers of God or of anything good.<p>I came to this country in 1958 and have lived here for most of the time since then. According to my observation, this country was not as morally poor in 1958 as it is today. I saw the start of the ruin. To a large degree, this ruin started around 1963. At that time the hippie movement started with its lawlessness, drugs, and immorality. This is a repetition of human history. Many evil things have happened in this country with the young people since 1963 because the intention of Satan, the subtle serpent, is to ruin the young people and frustrate God&#8217;s purpose.<p>Praise the Lord that in the midst of such a situation of ruin, He has visited many of us. Many of the young people among us have not only been caught by God but also occupied by Him. They have been &#8220;wrecked&#8221; by Him. Satan spoils people, but God &#8220;wrecks&#8221; people. Satan spoils people to make them useless for God&#8217;s purpose, but God wrecks people to make them useless for Satan&#8217;s purpose, the purpose of loving money and pleasure. Why would so many young people attend the meetings of the church? Why would they not seek sports or entertainment? It is because they are wrecked. Over sixty years ago, I was wrecked by God. I was a very active, ambitious, and somewhat smart young man. However, one day I was wrecked by God. Several times I tried to go back to my old way, but because I was wrecked, I could not make it. We have been caught and occupied by Him.<h2 class=head1>PURPOSING IN OUR HEART NOT TO BE DEFILED</h2><p>According to Genesis, by the time Babel and its tower were built, mankind was fully ruined, captured, and preoccupied by the Devil. The old mankind under the headship of Adam was fully ruined by Satan and had become useless. Therefore, God gave it up. Out of that situation, God called one man, Abraham, to raise up a holy race, a new mankind. Eventually that holy race was built up as the kingdom of God on the earth. At the center of that kingdom was the temple. The temple was God&#8217;s habitation as the very testimony of God on the earth. The vessels of God&#8217;s house, signifying the riches of God&#8217;s testimony, were in the temple.<p>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, conquered Jerusalem, captured the vessels of God&#8217;s temple, and carried them into his idol temple (2 Chron. 36:17-20; Ezra 1:7). The captivity of Israel signified that God&#8217;s testimony was spoiled. In order to glorify himself and shame the captured Israelites, Nebuchadnezzar also selected the best, smartest, and most excellent young people, especially from the royal family, and brought them into his palace to eat his food and drink his wine (Dan. 1:3-5). No doubt, he offered his food and wine to the idols before he ate and drank because he considered that it was they who gave him his great empire.<p>Daniel was taken into captivity as a young man. He and his three friends, who were of the children of Judah, were selected to come into the king&#8217;s palace to be taught. There they had to decide whether or not they would eat the food sacrificed to idols. That meat was no longer merely food; it had become related to the demons. To eat it was not a small thing. Daniel and his three friends purposed in their heart not to be defiled, not to have any share in that defiling element (Dan. 1:8).<p>For Daniel and his three friends not to eat the king&#8217;s food was to protest, to be God&#8217;s testimony, against the tide of idolatry. This was a great matter in the eyes of God and also in the eyes of the Devil. This was the fighting of a spiritual warfare. In such a situation, Daniel was one who was caught by God. From his very youth, he was called, captured, and fully occupied by God. Eventually, it was he who brought in the return from captivity. Daniel was still living during the reigns of Darius and Cyrus after the Babylonian Empire had become the Persian Empire (Dan. 9:1-2; 1:21). When he read the prophecy given through Jeremiah that the captivity would be accomplished for seventy years, he began to pray for God&#8217;s people (Dan. 9:1-19). His prayer brought in the fulfillment of the children of Israel&#8217;s return from captivity, which began from the decree of Cyrus in the first year of his reign (Ezra 1:1-3).<p>Young people today are also in a situation of captivity. God&#8217;s testimony has been spoiled, and the riches, the vessels, of God&#8217;s testimony have been taken captive. Everything in this age is defiling, including religion and society with its pleasures. Today all religions are in a form of idolatry. Religion takes God&#8217;s name, but worships something other than God. This is idolatry. God needs some young people to keep themselves from being defiled by the idolatrous worship. Once some young people see the situation of today&#8217;s religion, they will purpose in their heart. They will say, &#8220;Lord, from today I would never become polluted with this religion. I would stay away from this defilement.&#8221; To flee youthful lusts is to keep from being defiled.<p>The young people must make such a purpose in their heart. To simply receive salvation is good, but by itself it cannot satisfy completely. After being saved, many still have a hunger within and are still seeking something further and higher. What they are seeking is God&#8217;s purpose. They should realize that the background of their situation is one of captivity and should desire to come out of captivity and not remain in its defilement. The young people must pray, &#8220;Lord, help me to make a purpose in my heart not to defile myself.&#8221; If the young people would make such a purpose deep in their heart, God will use them. Each one will be much used by the Lord. Fifty years ago, I was one of many young people who made such a purpose in their heart. All of us were used by God. In the past half century, Christianity in the Far East has been much influenced by these young people. In a sense, we revolutionized Christianity in the Far East. Today also in this great Christian country, the United States, God needs so many young people.<p>Do not go along with the present situation. At the time of Daniel, some young people might have said, &#8220;What is wrong for us to eat the king&#8217;s meat? Everything created by God is clean. We do not care whether or not this food has been offered to idols. We will just take advantage of it.&#8221; This is a word of failure and defeat. They should rather have said, &#8220;I will never go along with this current. I will keep away from it. I protest against the present situation. Let others eat, but I will not.&#8221; If the young people today would make a purpose such as this deep in their heart, God will use them.<p>The young people must learn to flee. They need to flee youthful lusts (2 Tim. 2:22a). Young people have a lust for eating. Most young people like to eat good things. The meat and the wine provided by King Nebuchadnezzar were surely a strong temptation to Daniel and his three friends. This food was the best food, the royal food. There was an eating lust within Daniel, but he stayed away from this lust. He and his friends were fleeing youthful lusts.<p>The young people need to flee youthful lusts, and they should also pursue, that is, seek after, righteousness, faith, love, and peace (2 Tim. 2:22b). Righteousness, faith, love, and peace are all Christ. To pursue these things is to pursue Christ in different aspects. Flee youthful lusts, and pursue Christ as your righteousness in your relationship with others, as your faith in your relationship with God, as your love in your relationship with one another, and as your very peace. Such fleeing and pursuing is a living for God&#8217;s testimony. It is a daily gospel life. A daily walk which expresses righteousness, faith, love, and peace is the best gospel preaching. It is the life that opens the way for the gospel to reach people.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR COMPANIONS</h2><p>You must have such a life of fleeing and pursuing. However, when you endeavor to flee and pursue, you will find that you are not able to do so by yourself. The way to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ is in the last part of 2 Timothy 2:22. This verse says, &#8220;But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221; You need &#8220;those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221; By yourself you are inadequate. The key is to be &#8220;with those.&#8221; As a young person you may be very strong, but your strength means nothing. The enemy, Satan, is stronger than you are, but under God&#8217;s sovereign provision, you have &#8220;those.&#8221; You must pursue &#8220;with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221;<p>The young people must make the decision to pick up some others as companions. Daniel had his three friends. Under the Lord Jesus in the New Testament none of the disciples were individuals. They were sent two by two; they all had companions. Peter and Andrew and James and John are referred to in the Gospels in pairs (Matt. 4:18, 21).<p>Young people need at least one companion. You must consider before the Lord whether you have a real companion in pursuing the Lord. Joshua could have said that Caleb was his companion, and Caleb could have said that Joshua was his companion. However, it is better to have three or four companions. Because of these perilous times, we need more companions. If we have four companions to support us from each direction, we will not fall, regardless of what storm may come. If one stands by himself, he will possibly be captured by the enemy. It is best for four or five young ones from junior high school to come together as companions. Let the young brothers be companions to one another, and let the young sisters be companions to one another.<p>We need companions not only because we are weak to stand by ourselves, but also because we are all so natural. According to our natural disposition, it is very hard for us to have companions. Our individualism is a pleasure to us. We enjoy our individualism so much. We may not care for a brother or a sister because they are not like us. We demand that others be like us. Wanting people to be like us is devilish. If we love the Lord, we should be able to go to any young brother or sister, not caring for what they are like. They may be slow or quick, dull or smart, like you or one hundred percent different from you. We should forget all the differences. We must have companions. If the young people would be grouped in this way, Satan will be put to shame. This is a great matter.<p>If five junior high school students would be grouped together as one, their school will be &#8220;overthrown.&#8221; If they start with five, after not long a time, perhaps two months, there will be fifteen. The preaching of the gospel in their school will be like wildfire. Even the college age and working age saints need companions. They need to work together, live together, and have their daily walk together. Ecclesiastes 4:12 says, &#8220;A threefold cord is not quickly broken.&#8221; If one person has four companions, the five of them will even be a fivefold cord. Nothing can break this cord. The gospel preaching of these five will be prevailing. They will subdue people. Their grouping together will convince people, and Satan will be put to shame.<p>Do not have companions in a loose way. Do not take a brother as a companion because you like him and tomorrow reject him because you do not like him. If he is a brother, you must take him. This will subdue and break you. You need to be broken. Who will break you? Wives are good &#8220;breakers,&#8221; but I do not trust the wives to completely break the husbands. The good &#8220;breakers&#8221; are the brothers and sisters with whom you group yourself.<p>The young people must look to the Lord to get four or five companions. Even the people in the world say that union is power. By myself I would not dare to do many things, but when I have four companions, I would dare to do anything. The five companions should always call on the name of the Lord together (2 Tim. 2:22). They should always come together to fellowship, pray-read, pray, and take care of new ones. One brother&#8217;s new ones should be another brother&#8217;s new ones also. In this way one group of five saints will have fifteen new ones under their care. All these new ones will be saved. The principle for the saints in both the Old and New Testaments is that they should be grouped together. The young people need to flee youthful lusts and pursue the Lord with some companions.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE VISION OF THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:15-18; Eph. 5:32; Phil. 3:10a; Rev. 1:10-13a</h1><p>In the previous chapter we saw that the young people need to purpose in their heart not to be defiled by the things of this age. They need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions, &#8220;those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:22). In this chapter we shall see what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is the recovery of Christ and the church. Although these terms may be familiar to us, I would still encourage the young people to spend much time with their companions in groups of five to thoroughly research the truths concerning Christ and the church.<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord revealed Himself and the church to His disciples. Verses 15 through 18a say, &#8220;He says to them, But you, who do you say that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said to him...I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s recovery is not a recovery of doctrines such as footwashing, head covering, proper baptisms, or the bread and wine at the Lord&#8217;s table. It is a recovery of &#8220;the Christ&#8221; and &#8220;the church.&#8221; The term recovery implies that something has been lost. If something has not been lost, there is no need of a recovery. The proper revelation of the Christ and the church has been lost. Many in Christianity do not have a proper understanding of who Christ is and of what the church is. Many only know and appreciate the Jesus who is their Savior, saving them from hell to heaven.<h2 class=head1>THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Christ</h2><p>Matthew 16:16 speaks of &#8220;the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; According to this verse, Christ has two main aspects. The first is His person and the second is His work, ministry, or commission. Therefore, He has two main titles. The Christ is His title according to His ministry. Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek Christos, meaning the anointed One. Daniel 9:26 says, &#8220;And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off&#8221; (ASV). &#8220;The anointed one&#8221; is a translation of the Hebrew word for Messiah, the equivalent of the Greek Christos. In God&#8217;s administration, whenever God commissions someone to fulfill His purpose, He anoints that one. When God established priests, kings, and prophets, they were anointed. Samuel anointed David to be king (1 Sam. 16:13), and Moses anointed Aaron and his sons to be the priests (Lev. 8:30). To be anointed is to be charged with a certain commission. In today&#8217;s terms, to be anointed is to be appointed. God appoints one to fulfill His commission by anointing him.<p>In typology the anointing oil or ointment signifies God the Spirit. God anoints people with Himself. When Jesus was baptized and came out of the water, the Holy Spirit came upon Him (Matt. 3:16). The Holy Spirit was the ointment, and the Spirit&#8217;s coming upon Him was the anointing. Therefore, in Luke 4:18 Jesus said, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me.&#8221; On the day of Pentecost before the one hundred twenty proclaimed the gospel for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s commission, God poured out His ointment, His Spirit, upon them (Acts 2:1-4, 14-18), and they were all anointed.<p>Christ means the anointed One. God has anointed His Son. This anointing was accomplished both in eternity past before the foundation of the world and in time. In eternity past God anointed and commissioned His Son. God the Father was the Author, the Source, the Planner, the One who made a purpose. God&#8217;s purpose which He made in eternity past for eternity future, His eternal purpose, was to have a church to express the Triune God in a corporate way. When God made this purpose, He anointed His Son, charging Him with the commission to fulfill His eternal plan. This is indicated by His title, the Christ.<p>At the beginning of time, the Son of God as God&#8217;s anointed One, the Christ, came to create. The Son of God accomplished the creation because as God&#8217;s anointed He was charged by God to do this. John 1:1 and 3 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.&#8221; For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs a universe with a heaven and an earth with 80 many items, especially man as a vessel to contain God. Christ came as God&#8217;s anointed One to call the things not being into being. Creation was the first item in God&#8217;s commission which He gave to His anointed One.<p>The second item in God&#8217;s commission was the incarnation. John 1:14 says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; In incarnation He brought God into man, that is, into His creation.<p>The third item of the commission of Christ, the anointed One, was the crucifixion. Crucifixion signifies the termination of the entire old creation (Col. 1:15, 20). God&#8217;s creation became old because of Satan&#8217;s rebellion and man&#8217;s fall. The angels and mankind were the two main items of God&#8217;s creation, the living creatures which God created for His purpose. The angels were in the heavens, and man was upon the earth. The Bible tells us that the leading angel rebelled and became Satan (Ezek. 28:14-18; Isa. 14:12-14). That rebellion contaminated the whole creation. This rebellious leader of the angelic race then tempted and seduced the head of mankind to fall. The contamination of Satan got into mankind, and man became contaminated. Both the angelic race and the human race became contaminated and evil. As a result, the entire creation became old. To be old is not a matter of age. God is the most ancient One, but He is never old. After we have been in eternity for so many years, we will be ancient, but we will never be old. The New Jerusalem will be ever new. It will be ancient but not old. Oldness is due to contamination, corruption, and vanity.<p>Romans 8:20 and 21 say that the whole creation is under the slavery of corruption, subjected to vanity. God as the ever new, ever fresh God, the &#8220;evergreen&#8221; God, could never use anything old. This corrupted old creation as something of vanity had to be terminated. Christ accomplished this in His crucifixion. Christ Himself created, and Christ Himself also terminated the old creation. This is the significance of crucifixion.<p>The fourth step of Christ&#8217;s commission was resurrection. Resurrection means germination. Christ terminated all the old creation in His crucifixion, and in His resurrection He germinated the crucified creation with the very God as the divine germ, the seed of life. God as the divine life has been wrought into the crucified man as a germ to germinate him. The created man who was crucified was also resurrected to become the new creation. Resurrection was the producing of the new creation.<p>After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens. Christ&#8217;s ascension was His inauguration. After a president is elected, he must be inaugurated. Inauguration is to place the selected one into his position. Christ was appointed by God, but He was not officially inaugurated before His ascension. When Christ ascended to the heavens, God inaugurated Him officially, universally, and once for all, putting Him into His position. Acts 2:36 says, &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ-this Jesus whom you crucified.&#8221; Before the ascension, the Lord of the universe was only Jehovah or Elohim. But on the day of ascension a man by the name of Jesus, who was mingled with God, was inaugurated to be the Lord of all. Praise Him! Now the Christ is fully qualified, officially inaugurated. He is the Christ who created, who became incarnated, who was crucified, who was resurrected, and who ascended to the third heavens, inaugurated to be the Lord of the whole universe.<p>Jesus asked His disciples, &#8220;Who do you say that I am?&#8221; (Matt. 16:15). When we answer, &#8220;You are the Christ,&#8221; we must know what we mean by &#8220;the Christ.&#8221; We must be able to give a long definition of the Christ. The revelation that I have presented in this chapter is only a small part of the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the Christ. In this chapter I am presenting only major points and lines of research. This is an outline which the young people must build upon. You must research all these matters. The laboratory for your research will be your group of companions.<h2 class=head2>The Son of the Living God</h2><p>Peter answered the Lord, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8221; (Matt. 16:16). The title &#8220;the Son of the living God&#8221; is quite meaningful. The Christ is the Lord&#8217;s title in His commission, while the Son of the living God is the title of the Lord&#8217;s person, indicating who He is. He is the Son of the living God. John 5:18 says, &#8220;For this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&#8221; The ancient Jews understood that to be called the Son of God was to be equal to God. They considered it blasphemy for Jesus, a man from Nazareth, to say that He was the Son of God, making Himself equal with God.<p>Even though Jesus is God, He is still called the Son of God. The Father refers to the source of life. The father of a family is the source of the life of that family. While the Father is the source of life, the Son is the expression, the propagation, and the multiplication of life. When a man is a bachelor, he is alone. However, after he marries he will have children and eventually may have many grandchildren. These children and grandchildren are his propagation and multiplication. God the Father as the source of life needs the Son of God as the propagation and the multiplication of life.<p>To speak of Christ is to refer to His work, but to speak of the Son of God is to refer to His person as life. The Son of the living God has life. He is the expression of the living One, and the expression of the living One is life. There is no human language that can express what life is. Life is One who never dies, but who is ever living for eternity. This is God, and God is expressed, propagated, and multiplied in the Son. The Son is the life of the Father. John 1:1 and 18 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; In the beginning He was God, and in time He was the declaration of God, the Son of God. In His declaration the Son said, &#8220;I am...the life&#8221; (John 14:6).<p>The title, the Son of the living God, denotes not only life but also life to us. Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). The Gospel of John tells us that God as the source of life is Spirit (John 4:24). The Son of the living God as the expression of the source, as life to us, is also the Word as the Spirit. He is the living Word, and this living Word is the Spirit. We all must be born of this Spirit. We received our first birth from our parents in our flesh, but we need a second birth in our spirit (John 3:6). The Spirit of whom we are born is not only God Himself, but also the Son of the living God as life to us, the Word and the Spirit. Such a One has entered into and is now residing in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). Our life today is not in our flesh or our soul but in our spirit. This is why we have to set our mind, our being, on our spirit (Rom. 8:6). The mind set on the spirit is life because life is in our spirit. This life is the Son of the living God as the Word and the Spirit. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is the recovery of such a Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The second aspect of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the church. When Peter recognized and acknowledged that the Lord Jesus was the Christ and the Son of the living God, Jesus answered, &#8220;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). Peter had seen one-half of the revelation but not the other half. He had seen the Husband but not the wife. He had seen the Head but not the Body.<p>The church is the second half of the Lord&#8217;s recovery because not only has the revelation of the Christ been lost, but the revelation of the church has also been lost. Many in Christianity today do not like to talk about the church. They are afraid of this subject. This is the subtlety of the enemy because without the church God can never fulfill His purpose. Without the church Christ, God&#8217;s anointed One, can never complete His commission. His commission is creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension for the bringing forth and building up of the church. Creation was for the church, incarnation was for the church, crucifixion was for the church, resurrection was for the church, and ascension was for the church. All the steps of Christ&#8217;s commission are for the church, either to produce the church, to bring it into existence, or to build the church.<p>The book of Revelation, the conclusion of the Bible, speaks of a city (Rev. 21:10-27). A city is the largest unit of building. The city, the New Jerusalem, is the ultimate building in the entire universe, and this building is the ultimate consummation of the building up of the church. Without the building up of the church, Christ as God&#8217;s anointed One can never accomplish His commission to consummate the building. Therefore, we all must see the recovery of the church.<h2 class=head2>The Universal Body of Christ</h2><p>Just as Christ has two aspects, His person and His ministry, the church also has two aspects, the universal aspect and the local aspect. Universally speaking, the church is the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). Christ as the Head has only one Body. It would be terrible for a person to have one head and many bodies. Universally speaking, the Body of Christ, which is the church, is one.<p>Just as Christ and the church are one Head and one Body, they are also one Husband and one wife. Christ does not agree with polygamy. Christ agrees with the principle of one husband and one wife. Fornication and adultery are abominable in the eyes of God because they destroy humankind and spoil the significance of marriage. Marriage signifies that Christ as the Husband has only one wife. Instead of the church being expressed as the one wife of Christ, Christianity has produced many divisions. These divisions may be considered as &#8220;concubines.&#8221; Concubines do not care for the proper wife. They may say to the wife, &#8220;Are only you the wife? Are we not also wives?&#8221; Hagar might have asked Sarah, &#8220;Is Abraham only your husband? Isn&#8217;t he my husband also?&#8221; Abraham was Hagar&#8217;s husband, but she was not his wife; she was his concubine. Just as Sarah foolishly proposed that Abraham take a concubine (Gen. 16:2), the church in the past has produced many &#8220;concubines.&#8221; Because the young people would like to be used by the Lord to turn the age, they must know that to turn the age is to turn it from the concubines to the wife. They must see that according to God&#8217;s eternal plan, the very anointed One of God should have only one Body, one wife, the church. In the entire universe the church must be one. This is the universal aspect of the church.<p>I like to see people get saved. However, only to be saved is not meaningful enough. The most meaningful thing is to get into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is the continuation of God&#8217;s eternal economy. To get into God&#8217;s economy is a great thing. I gave up everything for this recovery, and in doing so I made the best choice. I was one of only a few of my schoolmates, friends, and relatives who made this choice. Many years ago they misunderstood me, but now they appreciate my choice. Even those who have not been saved tell me that I made the proper choice. Nothing else on earth except the Lord&#8217;s eternal economy is meaningful. Even to become the President of the United States does not mean so much. To come into the Lord&#8217;s recovery as a young person and carry on the divine economy is glorious and becomes more glorious as time goes on. Let the enemy wait and see. When we are the New Jerusalem, the whole universe will declare that we made a marvelous choice.<p>It is not sufficient only to be saved, to preach the gospel to get others saved, and to be spiritual. We must realize that God has an eternal plan. God has an economy to accomplish in the universe, and He is accomplishing it now in this age. In the last fifty years, I have seen many things happen according to the prophecies in the Bible. In 1967 Israel took over Jerusalem against the protest of so many nations. I told the brothers at that time not to worry for Israel&#8217;s sake because the Lord would take care of them. What happened there was the Lord&#8217;s doing. Who could oppose it? All the surrounding Arab countries have not been able to do anything to that little nation of just over two million people. The prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled now. However, the Lord is not waiting for Israel. He is waiting today for the recovered church. Israel is now a nation, but where is the church? For the accomplishment of His economy God needs both Israel and the church. In Revelation there are two groups of one hundred forty-four thousand, one from Israel (7:3-8) and one from the church (14:1-5). According to prophecy, there should be these two peoples cooperating with the Lord to fulfill His purpose. The nation of Israel is established even though they are still unbelieving, but today the Lord is waiting for the church. There is no proper church to match the Lord&#8217;s move on the earth today. The Lord does have a recovery, but it is still too small.<p>It is not an accident that so many young people have been brought into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This is something sovereign of the Lord. I hope that the real situation regarding the church will be clear to all of you.<h2 class=head2>The Local Church</h2><p>The second aspect of the church is the local aspect. In each locality there should be an expression of the Body of Christ (Acts 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11). This expression of the Body in a locality is the local church. The universal aspect of the church is revealed in the book of Ephesians, while the local aspect of the church is unfolded practically in the book of Revelation. In chapters 2 and 3 there are seven churches in seven cities, one church in each city. We all must see the one Body, and we must also see the local churches. We must see the universal aspect of the Body, and we must also see the local aspect of the church, the local churches. In every locality the church must be one as the local church.<p>To see the local churches we must be in our spirit (Rev. 1:10-12). Do not exercise your mind. The more you exercise your mind, the more you will be confused. We need to be in our spirit, and we need to be out of our self. We must be away from the present situation, away from today&#8217;s culture and religion. We must be away from everything else and be in our spirit. Then we will see not only the church but also the churches.<p>The Bible reveals four great figures: God, Christ, the church, and the churches. The Jewish people today do not believe in Christ, but they do believe in God. Fundamental Christians not only believe in God, but they also believe in Christ. However, many Christians have no concept of the universal church. Some Christians with improved knowledge have a vision of the church as the universal Body. They have a heavenly vision, but they cannot touch it practically. I do not want merely a heavenly vision that is not practical. Praise the Lord, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we have seen not only God, Christ, and the universal Body, but also the local churches.<p>Most of the Jews today are still in &#8220;Genesis.&#8221; Many Christians are in the &#8220;four Gospels,&#8221; while a few might be in &#8220;Ephesians.&#8221; However, the church people today are in &#8220;Revelation.&#8221; Because we are living in the local churches, we are close to the New Jerusalem. Where is the Lord Jesus today? He is the Son of Man walking in the midst of the seven lampstands (Rev. 1:9-20). If you wish to find the Lord Jesus, you must get into the seven lampstands, which are the seven local churches. Today the Lord Jesus, not only as the Son of God but also as the Son of Man, is in the midst of the local churches.<p>The local churches are different from the denominations. In Genesis 2 Adam gave names to all the animals, but none of them matched him. He needed someone who matched him, who was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh (Gen. 2:19-23). Just as Eve was different from all the animals, the Lord has made the church different from everything else. Some who do not care for the local churches may still appreciate that the churches are different from the denominations, and they may try to imitate the churches. They may imitate the churches, yet they may still not be the proper church. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is not a matter of certain practices. It is the recovery of the local church as the expression of the Body of Christ. Today we have God, Christ, the Body, and the local churches. Because we are standing as the local churches, we are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>The young people should have much fellowship about the Christ and the church, not only in one group of five companions but in five or ten groups coming together. You may also need to read some of our publications. You need the experience and you also need the definition of all these matters.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP</h1><p>In the previous chapters we saw that the young people in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions. We also saw that the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the recovery of &#8220;the Christ&#8221; and &#8220;the church.&#8221; In this chapter we shall fellowship concerning four strategic points regarding the young people: the need to know the life experiences, the practical way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s recovery, the need to read the Word and the messages, and the matter of giving in God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE LIFE EXPERIENCES</h2><p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the young people should join together in groups of five for the purpose of researching the things concerning Christ and the church. When a group comes together, one brother may ask the others if they can speak something concerning the assurance of salvation. The young people in the church may know how to call on the name of the Lord, and they have been saved. However, some may not know assuredly that they are saved. Eventually, their assurance of salvation will be tested. The young people should thoroughly fellowship matters such as the assurance of salvation and regeneration in their groups.<p>There has not been enough time for the church as a whole to cover these matters. As a result, the knowledge and experience of the young people is too general. The young people should take care of their own need in their groups of five. If they do not, we may eventually have a good number of saints among us, but they will not be thoroughly rooted in spiritual matters. If five young people cannot speak clearly to each other about the assurance of salvation, how can they help others? They may only be able to help them to call on the name of the Lord in a general way. In their groups the young ones should help each other to be clear about the life experiences.<p>Those who take the lead among the young people should recommend one or two points for them to cover each week in their small groups. We have been coming together in a general way for a long time. Now we need to lay a solid foundation in the life experiences. Every church needs such a solid foundation so that when new ones come to the church they can be helped to know the life experiences. Without such a foundation, we may have a large number of young people, yet not many of them will be clear about the truth.<p>We need to lay a foundation for the young people&#8217;s work. The young ones should be helped to know what the assurance of salvation is, what regeneration is, and what eternal life is. If each group covers one or two points a week, after half a year they will have covered thirty or forty basic points. This will lay a good foundation. It is not enough to come together and pray in a general way. The young people must do something specific, just as we eat something specific and definite at every meal.<p>To practice meeting in small groups is not a difficult thing to do. Every week after a church meeting, five young people could go to a brother&#8217;s home for fellowship. To spend even only fifteen minutes will be a help to them. They should not fellowship there in a general way. This is the time to cover two or three specific points.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICAL WAY TO CARRY OUT THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY-IN AND BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the recovery of the Christ and the church. If we consider that this is the work of one man, we do not know what the recovery is. The young people must be the ones to carry out the recovery. Therefore, we need to know the practical way for the young people to do this. If we do not take the practical way, we will repeat the history of Christianity. We will merely be a congregation coming together to listen to a good speaker.<p>The practical way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s recovery is in and by the mingled spirit. We began by the Spirit (Gal. 3:3), and we should continue by the Spirit. In the New Testament the spirit is of two aspects, the Holy Spirit and our human spirit. These two spirits are mingled as one (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17). God is Spirit (John 4:24), Christ our Redeemer has become a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and the third of the Godhead for God to reach us is the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). God does not reach us as the Father or as the Son but as the Spirit. Moreover, there is no other way for us to contact God, to contact Christ, to contact the Spirit, but by our human spirit (John 4:24). Therefore, the young people must concentrate their whole being on the divine Spirit and our human spirit mingled together as one spirit.<p>In the last chapter, we saw that the church must have the oneness. The real ground of oneness is our spirit. In the Old Testament, Jerusalem was the unique place where all the people of God had to come to worship. There was only one temple, and that temple was in Jerusalem. All God&#8217;s people had to go there because that was where God&#8217;s habitation was. In typology the place of oneness was Jerusalem, but today in actuality it is our spirit. The unique place in which we meet is our human spirit because God&#8217;s habitation today is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). We do not merely meet at a certain address; we meet in our spirit. If I were not in my spirit, I would be separated from all the brothers and sisters. Christianity is divided because many Christians have been scattered away from their human spirit. Many do not meet in the real Jerusalem.<p>The way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s recovery is by the divine Spirit and the human spirit. The young people should come together in their groups to research the matter of the two spirits. They should know 1 Corinthians 15:45 and be able to explain how Christ became a life-giving Spirit and why Christ needed to become the Spirit. Our understanding concerning the divine Spirit and the human spirit is too general. We lack the basic building of a proper foundation.<p>The reason that many young people do not function in the meetings is that they have not been in their spirit. The way to get into the spirit is to pray. At First it may be difficult to pray by yourself. This is why the groups of five are needed. The five need to pray together. A group may even make the decision to fast and pray. They may meet for a long time to pray themselves into the spirit and to stir up their spirit. Our spirit is crucial. We must get into the spirit and learn to exercise and touch our spirit in every situation. When we have prayed ourselves into the spirit, it will be easy to function in the meetings. We do not need to seek a special experience. We just need to pray. When we pray to stir up our spirit and pray ourselves into our spirit, we will experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit. To pray in this way is the best way to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit.<p>Life is the Spirit, and life is in our spirit (Rom. 8:10). Holiness is the Spirit, victory is the Spirit, power is the Spirit, and the anointing is the Spirit. Even the church life and our function are a matter of the Spirit. Everything spiritual, divine, and heavenly is a matter of the Spirit. God, life, and light are the Spirit. Without the Spirit we have no reality; we have only terminology. The reality is the Spirit, so the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality (John 16:13). This Spirit can only be realized in our spirit, by our spirit, and with our spirit. This Spirit is even one with our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; We may know some of the verses on the spirit, but we may have never thoroughly researched this matter. The young people must lay a good and basic foundation in the life experiences. I am burdened that you would have a proper realization of the way to carry on the church life.<h2 class=head1>READING THE WORD AND THE MESSAGES</h2><p>Among the young people today there is a great lack regarding the Word. The Spirit and the Word are like two feet to stand on. However, many of the young people may not be standing Firmly on either foot. We must be deeply rooted in the Spirit and in the Word.<p>The holy Word is very profound, and many Christians in the past may have known it only according to the letter. In their small groups, the young people should learn the secret of getting into the Word and knowing it, not merely according to the letter, but deeply, according to the spirit. This requires that they receive help from others, but the proper help is not easy to find. This is why we are burdened to publish many messages. These messages will help them to know the spiritual things of life from the Bible and will impart to them the secret of how to get into the depths of the holy Word. This secret cannot be imparted merely by teaching. It is imparted through our practice of reading the messages. Listening to the messages causes our spirit to be stirred up, but simply to listen is not adequate. To get our spirit rooted in the Word, we need to read the messages.<p>One effective and practical way to read the messages is to keep them in every room of your house. Every time you sit in your living room, dining room, or bedroom, you may read a few pages. In this way, you can finish one message every three days. The young people should purpose not to read anything other than the messages whenever they have the opportunity. After two weeks of practicing in this way, they will see a difference in their experience.<p>Do not read too slowly or too quickly. Simply read four or five pages each day. Sometimes when you come to a certain point, you may need to consider it for a while, and sometimes you may need to pray about it. You may need to fellowship about some points. To read a few pages in the morning in addition to your morning watch will help you for the whole day.<p>If we practice in this way, we will read over one hundred messages a year. We will learn the secret of how to know the Bible. Many books have been written on how to study the Bible, but very few are prevailing. No way is so prevailing as the practice of reading a few pages of the messages every day. The messages will help us to digest the verses and chapters of the Bible. Spontaneously the truth of the Word will be impressed and wrought into our being. After one year, many portions of the holy Word will be as transparent as crystal to us. To read a few pages in addition to our morning watch is not burdensome. We simply need to build up a good habit.<p>Before giving a message, I have much preparation for it. After I give the message and it is polished, I read through it carefully and even add more to it. Even though I work so much on each message, I still enjoy reading them again. When I read the messages again, they are so fresh, new, and  nourishing to me, and I receive new enlightenment.<p>We must deal with the Word in a very living way. We should read through the Bible in small portions whenever we have a little time. It is best to read it in sequence, starting from the first page. It is not necessary to determine how many times we will read it. Perhaps we may read the New Testament once or twice every year and the Old Testament once every one or two years. When we finish reading it once, we should start over and read it again. It is best to read a few verses every day. Before or after a meal we may read some. On work days we may have less time, but on weekends we will have time to read more. Even to read for five or ten minutes is helpful. The important thing is to build up a proper habit. However, we will still need the messages to help us to understand the whole Bible. The young people should practice reading in this way by themselves and with one another in their small groups.<h2 class=head1>GIVING</h2><p>God&#8217;s economy is a matter of giving. We must learn to give all the time. No one who loves the Lord should say that he has nothing to give. In Matthew 14 when a great crowd followed the Lord in the wilderness, the disciples said, &#8220;Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves&#8221; (v. 15). To send the crowds away was not to give anything to them. However, the Lord told them, &#8220;They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat&#8221; (v. 16). Verses 17-19 say, &#8220;And they say to Him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes. And He said, Bring them to Me. And commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and two fishes, and looking up to heaven, He blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.&#8221; This portion illustrates the way of giving. The disciples had very little compared to the number of people, but after the Lord&#8217;s blessing, what they had fed five thousand men, and what was left over filled twelve baskets.<p>Regardless of how much you have, simply give it. Before giving it you should say, &#8220;Lord, this is all that I have. I give it over into Your hands. Bless it and I will give it to others.&#8221; If we do this, we will see the abundance. This principle applies to all kinds of giving, including material giving.<p>To function in the meetings is to give. Do not say that you have nothing. You have something. It may be little, but you still need to give it. Just give what you have. If you will give the little you have, you will get more.<p>We all must give to others. First, we must give the gospel. Preaching the gospel is the giving of something to others. Then we must give people nourishment. Third, we must give material things. In the gospel, in visiting the saints, in shepherding, in functioning, in material matters, and in everything, we must learn to give.<p>In principle, when I was not generous in giving, I became poor. But when I was generous in every matter, I became rich. The more one gives, the more one receives. When five young ones come together, one may feel that he knows so little, but he should present what he knows or has experienced to the others. This little bit will be multiplied. By our giving we will get the multiplication. The way to multiply our life experience is to give. This is crucial to our Christian life, the church life, and our functioning in the meetings.<p>Learn to give everything. If you have two Bibles or two hymnals, give one to someone else. In principle, if you give one, you will receive two. When water flows out of one end of a water hose, more water flows in through the other end. But when the flowing out stops, the flowing in is cut off. In the giving of material things, we should not count the dollars we have to give. We should simply give something. Even one dollar is meaningful if it is given by us. If we stop giving, we cut off the Lord&#8217;s blessing.<p>The more we preach the gospel and pass on the Lord&#8217;s salvation to others, the more we experience salvation. The principle is always the same-the more we give, the more we receive, but when we stop giving, we cut ourselves off from the Lord&#8217;s blessing, even from His presence. A good church life is a life full of giving.<p>I hope that the young people will practice all the things we have seen in these chapters. You need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ together. You also need to see the vision of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. You should know the life experiences and concentrate your whole being on the divine Spirit and our human spirit mingled together as one spirit. Moreover, you should read the Word and the messages and learn to give in God&#8217;s economy. The place to practice all these things is not in the big meetings but in the small groups.</body></html>
