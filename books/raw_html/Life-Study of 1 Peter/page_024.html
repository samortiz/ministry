<h2 class="head1">CONSUMMATE SALVATION</h2><p>The salvation in verse 10 refers to the salvation of the soul mentioned in the preceding verse. The phrase &ldquo;salvation of the soul&rdquo; indicates a full salvation. It does not refer to initial salvation; it denotes consummate salvation, full salvation. Furthermore, as we have already pointed out, in verse 10 salvation and grace are synonyms. This means that grace here refers to God&rsquo;s full salvation. Many Christians define grace merely as unmerited favor. How shallow is this explanation! The grace in the Bible is not limited to some kind of unmerited favor. The grace in the Bible is equal to full salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN THE PROPHETS</h2><p>In verse 10 Peter also tells us that the prophets sought out and searched out. In verse 11 he speaks of the prophets&rsquo; searching. All these words indicate seeking. If we read through the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi, we shall see that all the Old Testament saints were seekers. I believe that they were much more exercised in their seeking than we are today. The prophets in particular were seeking and searching into what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them made clear. Let us quote the first part of Peter&rsquo;s word in verse 11 once again: &ldquo;Searching into what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them made clear.&rdquo; The composition here seems awkward. Nevertheless, Peter&rsquo;s expression is marvelous and has been much used by God. What does this marvelous expression indicate? It indicates that while the prophets were searching, they had the Spirit of Christ in them.</p><p>You may be troubled by the phrase &ldquo;the Spirit of Christ&rdquo; in verse 11. When some read this verse, they may say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have told us again and again that, according to John 7, the Spirit was not yet before Christ&rsquo;s glorification. You have told us that prior to Christ&rsquo;s glorification, the Spirit was only the Spirit of God with divinity and did not have the elements of humanity and of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. You have taught us that the Spirit of God had not yet been constituted of all these ingredients. But, Brother Lee, Peter speaks contrary to your teaching. He says that even in Old Testament times the Spirit of Christ was in the prophets. What would you say about this?&rdquo; I have even received letters asking me concerning these questions. In 1:11 Peter definitely says that while the ancient prophets were seeking and searching, the Spirit of Christ was in them. We need to consider this matter very carefully in order to understand it properly.</p><p>The highly respected Vaticanus manuscript omits &ldquo;of Christ.&rdquo; This omission fits in with the New Testament revelation concerning the Spirit. However, the other manuscripts of authority have &ldquo;of Christ&rdquo; in their text. In the New Testament revelation the Spirit of Christ denotes the Spirit after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Rom. 8:9-11). Before His resurrection, the Spirit that is not only the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Christ, was not yet (John 7:39). The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God constituted through and of the death and resurrection of Christ for the application and impartation of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection to His believers. Although the constitution of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational, constituted dispensationally through and of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection in New Testament times, His function is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). This can be compared to the cross of Christ: as an event, it was accomplished at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death, yet its function is eternal. Hence, in the eternal sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). In the Old Testament time, to the prophets who were seeking out and searching out the sufferings and glories of Christ, the Spirit of God, as the Spirit of Christ, made the time and the manner of time concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection clear.</p><p>Regarding the phrase &ldquo;of Christ,&rdquo; there is, as we have pointed out, some difference in the manuscripts. In translating the Bible, we need to study the manuscripts. Only when we have the proper manuscripts do we have the ground to make a translation. Whereas the Vaticanus manuscript does not have the phrase &ldquo;of Christ,&rdquo; other manuscripts do have it. It is right to go along with those manuscripts that include this phrase. The important matter for us to grasp is that the constituting of the Spirit of God to become the Spirit of Christ took place after the resurrection of Christ. This means that the constituting of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational. However, the function of the Spirit of Christ is eternal, for He is the eternal Spirit.</p> <p>As we have already indicated, we can compare the constituting of the Spirit to the crucifixion of Christ. When was Christ crucified? According to the facts of history, Christ was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago. But according to Revelation 13:8, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. This word in Revelation 13:8 is according to God&rsquo;s view. In the sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. But according to the accomplishment in history, Christ was crucified somewhat more than nineteen hundred years ago. Regarding its accomplishment, the crucifixion of Christ took place in time more than nineteen hundred years ago. But regarding function, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is eternal, and in the sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. The principle is the same with the constituting of God&rsquo;s Spirit to be the Spirit of Christ. The actual constituting took place after the resurrection of Christ. But the function of this Spirit is eternal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORKING OF THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN US</h2><p>Peter&rsquo;s somewhat awkward composition helps us to see that as the prophets were searching, the Spirit of Christ was working in them. Likewise, if we come to the holy Word with a seeking heart, immediately the Spirit of Christ will also work in us. I can testify of this from my experience. Many times, while I was studying, searching, and even researching the Scriptures, the Spirit of Christ made matters clear to me. Because of the working of the Spirit of Christ in me, I could see things that were beyond my ability to see. Praise the Lord, as we are searching in the Word, the Spirit of Christ is operating within us!</p>
