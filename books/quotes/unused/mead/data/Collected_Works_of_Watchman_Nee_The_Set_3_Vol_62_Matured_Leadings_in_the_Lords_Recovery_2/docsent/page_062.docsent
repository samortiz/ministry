   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gospel Songs</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In congregational preaching, we need gospel songs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These gospel songs should be one-fourth of the content of a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am an outsider as far as music is concerned, but I can make a few comments because I have learned some lessons these years in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing to remember in singing gospel songs is to not emphasize the music too much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we emphasize the music too much, we may lose the gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tune and the rhythm must be right, but the main emphasis should be the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we sing in private, we can take care of the music.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in leading others to sing in a gospel meeting, we must have spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Music is the inspiration of the soul; it can only touch man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to touch man's spirit, we must have spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have spiritual inspiration, we must fellowship with the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the only way to have spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose we are singing a song about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we sing it, we must have a feeling for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Men's hearts must be pricked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same can be said about songs on God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Others must genuinely touch God's love and be moved by it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people are fifty percent saved after they sing a song.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we sing properly, we can touch sinners easily.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another thing we should remember is that we should not try to put too much expression on our face when we sing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything should come spontaneously from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Things to Consider with Children's Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning children's meetings during the gospel meetings i.e., child care , we have to pay attention to a few points.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the content of the children's meeting must never be the same as the content of the gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the gospel message may be on vanity or the futility of work in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot speak this to the children, because such topics are unsuitable for their age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should tell the children Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Use Bible stories to show them the proper standard of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we have to beware of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, there is the possibility of premature spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, we can give away biblical truths too cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some teachers are too spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They tell children teachings that are too high and too spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, they may teach the children to pray, "Help us, Lord, to deal with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May Your cross work on us."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This gives the children premature spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will not help them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Other teachers treat spiritual things too lightly in an attempt to make the children understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their speaking does not do justice to the spiritual weight of their subject.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This gives away the truth too cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to use the stories in the Bible to teach the children some lessons they can apply in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to teach them to live a normal human life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, we cannot tell too many Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, they will only go home with a bag of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before children are old enough, we should never give them things that are too high or too spiritual for them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The teachers of the children's meetings have to be very careful with their behavior and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their attire should be neat and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They should not wear flashy clothing, hair styles, or make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Teachers sometimes set improper examples for children, and this damages the children for their entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Frivolous words and jokes and improper conduct and gestures should be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The teaching material is not that important by comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Teaching by example is more important than teaching by word of mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brothers and sisters who act as teachers should be very careful and sober in their character and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The young ones should remember these words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should do more and learn more.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The young people should learn to work, but they should not overdo anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They should learn to work in the proper amount.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they become too busy they will neglect the proper spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Learning to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>in All Kinds of Ways</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The above things require much training and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In preaching the gospel, we have to touch man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to use suitable words and deal with people in a suitable manner.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can ask some people to kneel down to pray, but we should allow others to sit down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not do anything by force.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>With some people, we can encourage them to kneel down, and when they kneel down, they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But others may react exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must touch man's spirit, and we must touch the spirit that is present at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some people may tell us that they are ready to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if we talk to them a little more and ask them to pray, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In all these matters we need a sensitive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to learn more and practice more.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As we practice more, we will pick up an interest for this work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not know anything about fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Often I lose my bait and the fish get away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not enough to know how to place the bait.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One has to know the disposition of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The same can be said of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We can push some people a little.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With others, we have to go along with them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we learn more and contact people more, we will discover the law to personal evangelism.</S>
