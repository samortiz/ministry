   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Overthrowing the Faith of Some</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 18 Paul also says that by having misaimed concerning the truth Hymenaeus and Philetus overthrew the faith of some.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith here is subjective and refers to the act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This subjective faith, our believing act, is very much related to the resurrection of Christ Rom 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have pointed out, this subjective faith involves an organic union between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For one's faith to be overthrown is to have this inward organic union damaged in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some among us can testify of having had this organic union temporarily cut off by hearing the words of those who taught differently.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inwardly these ones realized that the organic union within them had ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the overthrowing of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE FIRM FOUNDATION OF GOD AND ITS SEAL</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 19 Paul declares, "However, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christian teachers claim that the foundation here refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is true that in 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says that Christ is the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from Him, we do not have any other foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, if we consider verse 19 according to the context of the chapter, we shall see that the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but refers to the church as the foundation, or base, of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 14 through 18 give instruction concerning how to deal with heresies on the negative side and how to handle the truth on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the context of verses 15, 18, and 25, the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but to the church as the foundation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This corresponds to "the base of the truth," which holds the truth 1 Tim 3:15 , especially the truth of the resurrection of Christ Acts 4:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is built with the divine life in Christ, a life which is indestructible, unconquerable Heb 7:16; Acts 2:24 , and able to withstand decline into death from any source.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God that stands forever against any heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter what kind of heresies may come in or how extensively the gangrene may spread, this firm foundation stands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Certain of those who left the Lord's recovery expected that soon afterwards the recovery would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, because it is built upon a firm foundation, the recovery did not collapse and it will never collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Had the Lord's recovery been founded on something other than the divine life, the eternal life, it would have collapsed long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But because the recovery has the firm foundation of the truth, it is not hurt by attack.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, those who seek to damage the recovery actually damage themselves, and at the same time they strengthen the recovery and expose the firmness of its foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The recovery is built on something eternal and divine God's life with His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, not even the gates of Hades can conquer it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because it is built on the indestructible and unconquerable eternal life, the firm foundation of the truth stands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In recent years, it has not been necessary for us to protect the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been protected by the unconquerable divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God standing in the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul says that this firm foundation has "this seal."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seal has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the Lord's side it is: "The Lord knows those who are His."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is based on the Lord's divine life, which He has given to all His believers and which has brought them into an organic union with Him, making them one with Him and causing them to become His.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On our side it is: "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the issue of the divine life: it enables us to depart from unrighteousness and keeps us blameless in His holy name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church as the firm foundation in the divine life bears such a two-sided seal, testifying that the Lord's divine life has made us His and has kept us from things which are contrary to His righteous way.</S>
