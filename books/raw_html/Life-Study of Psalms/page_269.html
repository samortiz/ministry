<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD HAVING GIVEN THE EARTH<br>TO CHRIST AS HIS POSSESSION<br>AND THE NATIONS AS HIS INHERITANCE</H2><P>Psalm 2:8 says, "Ask of Me,/And I will give the nations as Your inheritance/And the limits of the earth as Your possession." This indicates that God has given the earth to Christ as His possession and the nations as His inheritance. Therefore, the earth with all the nations belongs to Christ. America belongs to Christ, not to the Americans, and Russia also belongs to Christ, not to the Russians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST COMING<br>TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE EARTH<br>BY PUTTING HIS RIGHT FOOT ON THE SEA<br>AND THE LEFT ON THE LAND</H2><P>Revelation 10:1-2 shows us that Christ will come to take possession of the earth by putting His right foot on the sea and the left on the land. Christ's placing His feet on the sea and on the land is His treading on them, and to tread on them is to take possession of them (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3; Psa. 8:6-8). In order to possess the land, one first must possess the sea. For this reason, Christ will possess the earth by putting His foot first on the sea and then on the land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE KINGDOM OF THE WORLD TO BECOME<br>THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST,<br>AND HE TO REIGN FOREVER AND EVER</H2><P>Revelation 11:15 tells us that the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord (God) and of His Christ and that Christ will reign forever and ever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. CHRIST REIGNING<br>AND THE WORLD ESTABLISHED</H2><P>"Jehovah reigns; He is clothed with majesty./Jehovah is clothed, He has girded Himself, with strength./Indeed the world has been established so that it cannot be moved./Your throne is established from of old;/You are from eternity" (Psa. 93:1-2). These verses indicate that when Christ reigns the earth is established. However, apart from the reign of Christ the earth is easily shaken. When God recovers His title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ, the earth will no longer be shaken but will be established.</P>
