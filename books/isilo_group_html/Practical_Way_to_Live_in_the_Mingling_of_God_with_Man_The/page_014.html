BY BEING FILLED WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Today many people misinterpret the Bible. They take the Bible as a book of proper behavior and morality. Although the Bible does speak of morality, we must realize that the Bible&rsquo;s central point is Christ, who fills us and in whom we are made full. The Bible tells us that we have to love one another (1 John 4:7). Real love, however, is not simply human affection. Genuine love is the overflow of Christ as love from within us to others. Many verses also tell us that we have to be humble (Matt. 23:12; 1 Pet. 5:5-6). To be humble is to be full of Christ and to have this Christ flow out of us (cf. Phil. 2:8, 5). Consequently, when we are full of Christ, we will be very humble. The Bible also tells us that Christians must obey their parents. Ephesians 6:1 says, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&rdquo; When reading this verse, we generally forget the little phrase <em>in the Lord.</em> We have to obey our parents, but we must do it in the Lord. This simply means that we need to be filled with Christ. Only then will we be able to obey our parents. The obedience we render to our parents is actually the overflow of Christ from within our being. In the Scriptures we are also told that we have to sacrifice, that is, give up, everything we have (Rom. 12:1; 2 Cor. 12:15). The sacrifice about which the Bible speaks is the overflow of Christ. It is because we have been filled with Christ and are full of Christ that we spontaneously give up all things. It should be clear that the Bible speaks mainly of Christ filling us, making us full of Him, and then flowing out of us. Our need is to be filled with and to overflow Christ.</p>
<p>In 1937 I was preaching the gospel to some learned students in Nanking, China. On one occasion, a very well-educated and intelligent young woman came to me and said, &ldquo;I appreciate your preaching very much and would like to receive it. However, I am fond of watching movies. I am wondering whether or not I will be allowed to go to movies if I become a Christian.&rdquo; Her question had the potential of being somewhat troublesome. On the one hand, I dared not tell her that after she became a Christian she could go to the movies as she liked. On the other hand, I could not tell her that she would no longer be allowed to attend movies. This young woman loved the movies so much simply because she was empty. If she were filled with Christ, she would not have any room in her being for movies. I illustrated this principle to her in the following way. I said, &ldquo;Let us say that there is a child here with a very sharp knife in his hand. Of course, we realize the danger that the knife poses to the child. What would you do to get the knife out of this child&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; The woman replied, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, this is quite easy. We simply place several pieces of fruit or candy on the floor. When the child sees the treats, he will put down the knife and take them up instead. Both of his hands will be full of the treats. Then, even if we asked him to take up the knife again, he would reply that since his hands are full of better things, he would not.&rdquo; When this young woman had finished answering, I said to her, &ldquo;You are right. When you are full of Christ, you will no longer need movies. This is the Christian faith. Being a Christian is not a matter of giving up movies or many other things. Being a Christian is simply a matter of being filled with Christ.&rdquo; We all must realize this. Being a Christian is simply a matter of being filled with Christ.</p>

WITH CHRIST&mdash;PRAYER</h2>
<p>How then can we be filled with Christ? To answer this, we must have a further realization. On the one hand, we are empty vessels. On the other hand, we are occupied vessels. If we are full of Christ, that is wonderful. However, if we are occupied by something other than Christ, we have a great need. It is because we are not filled with Christ but are filled with other matters that we need to receive this kind of fellowship. Too many things other than Christ occupy our mind, emotion, will, and heart. Each of us knows what occupies us. It is pitiful that we are filled with things other than Christ. When we find that this is our case, we simply have to come to Christ and tell Him that we are full of things other than Him. This is not so much a confession as it is simply telling the Lord our case. How we need to go to Christ to tell Him how much we have been filled with other things! Our need, I must repeat, is to simply tell Him how much our mind has been occupied by things other than Him.</p>
<p>Many Christians pray largely in vain. This is due mainly to the fact that they do not speak the truth to the Lord. Even though they are occupied with many things other than the Lord, they never admit this to the Lord. Although they may tell the Lord many other things, such as how weak they are and how much they need strengthening and power, these prayers are for the most part vain because they are not sincere. Sincere prayer is prayer in which we go to the Lord and tell Him how much we have been occupied in the past and how much we continue to be occupied at present. We need to tell the Lord the truth. We must tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am still occupied by these things in my mind and by those things in my emotion and will.&rdquo; This is sincere prayer. If we pray in this way, the more we tell the Lord, the more the Lord will occupy our mind, emotion, and will. The more we pray to the Lord in this way, the more He will occupy our entire heart and make our heart a home for Himself.</p>
<p>If we take this way, everything will be wonderful and glorious. If there is the need to love others, the overflow of Christ from within our being will be the love toward others. If there is the need to be humble, the overflow of Christ from within will be the humility. Christ Himself will fill us and meet our need. This is the right way to be a Christian. I know many saints who have been troubled by the enemy tempting them by saying, &ldquo;You say that you love the Lord. Therefore, you should be able to be humble and love others.&rdquo; If we give in to Satan&rsquo;s temptation to be humble and loving in ourselves, we will be defeated by him immediately. Whenever the enemy challenges us in such a way, we should tell him, &ldquo;I do not know whether I can be humble or love others. But one thing I know: I want to be filled with Christ. I do not know anything else. The only thing that I want is to be filled with Christ. Christ is my perfection. Christ is my completeness. Christ is my fullness. He will take care of everything else for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to learn to be filled with Christ by praying to the Lord genuinely and honestly. Christ is the Spirit, and as such He is in our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22). Christ is so real in our spirit. The way for us to be filled with Christ is to simply go to Him with a sincere heart, open our spirit to Him, and tell Him how much we are occupied in our mind, emotion, will, and heart with things other than Him. Let us tell Him the truth. Let us tell Him the real situation from our heart. Then we will be filled with Him. Day by day, we need to pray in such a way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Way to Live in the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
