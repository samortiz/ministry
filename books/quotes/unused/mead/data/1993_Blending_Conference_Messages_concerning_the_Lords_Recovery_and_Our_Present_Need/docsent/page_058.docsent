   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE GOD-REDEEMED-REGENERATED-</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TRANSFORMED-GLORIFIED PEOPLE,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>SIGNIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNS The Golden Lampstands</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I really appreciate this phrase the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to really see and be the testimony of Jesus, we need these signs in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first sign is that of the golden lampstands, which signify the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 1:9 says that John was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was in his spirit in order to see the vision of the testimony of Jesus made known by the signs v. 10 . He heard a voice behind him saying, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches" v. 11 . These seven churches were named as seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John then turned to see the voice that spoke with him and being turned he saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands he saw one like the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to His feet and girded at the breast with a golden girdle vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the churches in the Lord's recovery in God's eyes are golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lampstands are all identical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are full of the golden One, which is God Himself whom we love with all of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The lampstands are there to stand and to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord wants such a testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are in the churches, in the lampstands, living Jesus, testifying of Jesus by our living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The golden lampstands express the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This expression of the processed Triune God is first in the Father's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The gold as the substance of the stand signifies the Father's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, every local church must be constituted with the Father's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the sake of testifying Jesus unto God, we must be constituted with the Father's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The testimony of Jesus as the lampstands expressing the processed Triune God is also in the form of the Son, which is the embodied form of Christ as the shape of the stands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, the testimony of Jesus expressing the processed Triune God as the lampstands is in the Spirit's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is for the bright expression and the shining of the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the lampstands have three very crucial aspects: 1 the gold as the substance; 2 the stand itself with its form; and 3 the lamps with the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These three crucial aspects help us to understand what the Lord means when He reveals that the churches are golden lampstands to express the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to realize that if the Triune God had not been processed, He could not have an expression on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>About two thousand years ago, the Triune God became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hymns, #1017 says, "Christ has put on human nature and become a man like me,/He has died upon the cross that I from Adam might be free,/He has risen and as Spirit He has come to live in me/That He might be my life."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After Christ comes into us as life, He begins to spread in us for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ had to be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He was incarnated as the embodiment of God, He became the first lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus Himself, the living person, was the first lampstand constituted with the Father Himself as the golden One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was the embodiment of God so He had the form.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No man had ever seen God, but the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father declared Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell bodily Col 2:9; 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the reality of the lampstand, Jesus also lived in the Spirit, by the Spirit, with the Spirit, and through the Spirit to express God in everything of His living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His doing, His speaking, and everything about Him was a testimony to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the subjective testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank the Lord that His process did not end with incarnation but continued.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He died on the cross to terminate all the negative things, and then He was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b in order to impart Himself into all of His believers to make them the very enlargement of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seven golden lampstands as the testimony of Jesus are the reproduction, the duplication, and the continuation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are the multiplication of the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus as the first lampstand was the testimony of God and the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now He has been processed through death and resurrection to be the wonderful life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life is everything that we need to be the very expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This wonderful life, this life-giving Spirit, includes the substance of the Father's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ as the very embodiment of God is now the life-giving Spirit indwelling us to be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Also, this wonderful Spirit is the shining, enlivening, reviving, life-giving, and enlightening One to make us the bright and shining testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Triune God had never been processed, there could never be such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah for Jesus as the first lampstand!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah for the local churches as the reproduction and multiplication of Jesus!</S>
