The only work God approves is that of the spirit, and the breaking of the outer man is the only way that the spirit can have full freedom.</P><P>All of these messages were given by Watchman Nee during his training in Kuling for his co-workers in 1948 and 1949. May the Lord bless the readers through these pages.</P></td></tr></table></div>
