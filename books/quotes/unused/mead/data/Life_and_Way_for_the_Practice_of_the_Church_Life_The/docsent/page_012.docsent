   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING TO THE LORD IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS ENLIGHTENMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, the church life needs the real growth in life and the transformation by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not feel that I need to talk a lot about how Christ is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I do have the burden to give you a challenge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you live by Christ or by yourself today?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need to go to the Lord and have a genuine and thorough prayer before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just pray for one thing: "Lord, do I take You as my life day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do I live by You?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, how much room in your life has been given to the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much ground does the cross have in you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you really mean it when you say that "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that if we go to the Lord and pray in such a way, we will be exposed in the light of the Lord and will find out that even up to now we are still very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have very little transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that Christ is life to us, but day by day we do not live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, we are not learning the lessons of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not always take the cross as a check to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have the knowledge in our mentality, but we do not have the practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you take the cross and are checked by the cross, you will realize that Christ is so living and real within you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not only active but also acting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because He is living, you will sense something acting, enlightening, anointing, regulating, ruling, and governing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is something within you, and that is Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this chapter I am giving you a simple secret.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You need to pray about this matter today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Pray to Him in a real and thorough way, saying, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been a Christian for many years, but I wish to know where I am and how I am.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Put me in Your presence and in Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Expose me and let me see where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, do I really mean it when I say that You are my life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do I have some experience of the cross by applying it to my daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do I have some transformation?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I urge you to go to the Lord and pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then you will see where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Forget about taking care of your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>More than thirty years ago I was a young learner in the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time I did only one thing: I was always careful about my work, my attitude, and my actions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I tried to be very careful in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times I went to the elderly saints and asked them in a humble way, "Have I done something wrong in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Would you be kind enough to let me know?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please tell me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In those early days I spent much time with Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times I went to him asking him to tell me something about my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He just smiled and never said anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, the Lord revealed to me that when I was so concerned about my behavior, my attitude, and my work, it proved that I was so much in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day the Lord opened my eyes to see that I needed to forget everything about myself and learn the lesson of being checked by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem today in the church life is the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The natural life has to be put away, eliminated, and Christ must be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I say again that if you would go to the Lord and pray in this way, I have the assurance that you will sense how real, how living, how active, how positive, and how illuminating Christ is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will have the living Christ, the acting Christ, and the anointing Christ operating within you experientially all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then you will learn how to forget about yourself and to live and walk by taking Christ as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, you will have a transformation in life and not just some correction or adjustment in your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your whole being with your very nature, element, essence, and substance will be transformed by Christ in a living and real way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way you will realize the church life in a way which is absolutely different from the past.</S>
