   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 20:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"The first resurrection" is not necessarily a once-only resurrection; nor does it refer to any resurrection in general.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It includes all the "best" resurrections that happen before the millenium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "this" in verse 5 includes the two things mentioned in verse 4, that is, the living and the reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first resurrection is the "best" resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The best resurrection means to live and to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because verse 4 has two verbs "lived and reigned," the word "this" in verse 5 must refer to living and reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is called the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This resurrection is a reward and is both a resurrection and a reigning with the Lord for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"The second death" does not merely mean to die; rather, it means to go to a certain place to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is in contrast with the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first resurrection is the enjoyment of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only do those believers who are resurrected from the dead partake of the first resurrection, but also all those who are raptured alive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because the time of the first resurrection is the time of the reward, the time of repayment Luke 14:14; 20:34-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Philippians 3:11 Paul did not hope to be resurrected from the dead for surely all dead men will be resurrected , nor did he hope for the resurrection of the spirit for the resurrection of the spirit is received in regeneration .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, what Paul hoped to receive was the "out-resurrection," which is the best resurrection, spoken of in Revelation 20:5, that is, reigning with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Read Philippians 1:23-25 again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter one Paul talked of living; he did not want to die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How then could he speak about hoping to be resurrected from the dead in chapter three?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Philippians 3:20-21 he clearly said that he was waiting for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, his hope was to reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible, the phrase resurrection from the dead includes being resurrected from the dead, but more profoundly, it also refers to reigning with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two expressions in the Bible that are slightly different from each other:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 "The resurrection from the dead" indicates the resurrection before the millennium and refers to reigning with the Lord for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 "The resurrection of the dead" indicates the resurrection after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"The rest of the dead" of course includes the unsaved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Blessed" in the New Testament can be translated "happy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who are happy today are not necessarily holy, while those who are holy can hardly be happy today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first resurrection has three kinds of blessings:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1 "Over these the second death has no authority."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second death is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who have no part in the first resurrection will have to pass through the sufferings of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some Christians will be disciplined and punished in the future Matt 18:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Thessalonians 4:5-6 says that those who wrong their brothers will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke 12:4-5 exhorts men to fear the Lord because He has the authority to put some into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can see that hell will have authority over certain kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 15:6 we can see that the branches that do not abide in the Lord the vine will receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may say that the Bible states that once a man is saved he will never perish; so why does it say here that some Christians will still suffer being hurt of the second death Rev 2:11 ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because some verses are easily misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are listed below:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>a "He shall by no means see death forever" John 8:51-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the original text, it is, "Not forever see death"; "He shall by no means taste death forever" should be "He shall not forever taste of death."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>b "They shall by no means perish forever" in John 10:28 is, in the original text, "They shall not forever perish."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 "They will be priests of God and of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The meaning of being a priest is to be one who draws near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of people will be particularly close to God, for they will have an intimate relationship with Him and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we are all priests; therefore, we all may draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in the millennial kingdom, only those who have a part in the first resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Aaron could be a priest only because his rod budded.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The budding rod signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The chosen priest is manifested through resurrection Num 17:6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the people of Israel became priests when they left Egypt Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But later, due to their worshipping the golden calf, some failed, and God chose Aaron's tribe to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here the overcomers become priests because there is still the need to intercede for others at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"They will be priests...of Christ" because, at this time, Christ will be worshipped as much as God Himself is worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>3 "And will reign with him for a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament, no king could be a priest, neither could any priest be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But here is a group of people who are both priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As priests, they draw near to God; as kings, they have dominion over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only those who have suffered may reign with the Lord and enjoy the glory with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This verse only speaks of the fact of reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not say how the overcomers reign, because the reigning here is heavenly.</S>
