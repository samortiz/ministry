We may think that Christ's human living was a common thing, but it was altogether uncommon. This is because His human living was God's human living. He was a man, but He lived God. We Christians are men, but we should also be those who live Christ, who live God. To say that we live Christ, that we live God, means that we and Christ are one. When we say that we live for Christ, this indicates that Christ and we are two. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:15 that we need to live to Christ. Paul also said in Philippians 1:21, "For to me, to live is Christ." Philippians 1 shows that to magnify Christ (v. 20) is to live Christ, not to live for Christ.</P><P>The Bible does show us that we need to live for Christ and to live to Christ, but it also shows us that we need to live Christ. To live for Christ is somewhat shallow, to live to Christ is deeper, and to live Christ is the deepest. When we say that we "live Christ," this is new utterance to convey the divine facts in our spiritual culture. The language serves the facts in a culture. We need the spiritual, divine language to express the things in our spiritual culture. We need to speak as Paul spoke when he said that for him to live was Christ. We all need to be those who live Christ.</P><P>There was a human living on this earth not just by man but by God in man. This was God's living in humanity. In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life. In the previous message on God's incarnation, we saw that the purpose of the incarnation was to mingle God with man that God and man might be one. We can see the mingling of God and man in the type of the meal offering (Lev. 2:4). Stanza 5 of Hymns, #86 says, "Thou as a man art tender, sweet,/Balanced in every way, complete,/Meal-offering to the Father meet;/Lord, I remember Thee!" In the meal offering, there were two elements. One element was the fine flour made of wheat. The other element was the olive oil. The meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil. The word mingle means to combine two elements together to be one entity without a third element being produced. The two elements are combined together, but they still remain distinguishable. God and man are mingled together as one, but they still remain distinguishable.</P><P>In His incarnation, God entered into a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months. Then He was born to be a God-man and lived a human life within man for thirty-three and a half years. We have to pay our attention to His human living and fellowship about it because today we Christians are repeating His human living. Today God is moving in man, and He is living a human life in man.</P><P>We may have the boldness to say that Christ was God living a human life, but we would not say this about ourselves. Instead, we would say, "I am a man living the divine life." Christ is God, we are men, and we live Christ. Thus, we would say that we are men living God's life.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
