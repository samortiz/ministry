   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BIRTH AND GROWTH OF ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing messages we have covered nearly ten chapters in Genesis regarding Abraham's experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In those chapters we saw that Abraham, God's called one, had come to many stations and had passed through many stages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now in Genesis 21 Abraham comes to a wonderful and marvelous station.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Isaac is born.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7 The Birth and</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Growth of Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The goal of God's calling of Abraham was to bring forth a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This matter of the seed was first mentioned in 12:7 and is referred to many times in the following chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In nearly every chapter God touched Abraham concerning the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why was it so difficult for Abraham to have a seed?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was called, at the latest, at the age of seventy-five, but twenty-five years later he still did not have the seed, although God had called him for that very purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because he had difficulty producing the seed, Abraham first relied upon Eliezer, whom God rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, hearkening to his wife's proposal, Abraham produced Ishmael by Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, God also rejected Ishmael, saying that He did not want a seed out of an Egyptian maid but out of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God seemed to say to Abraham, "Yes, you have produced a seed, but it is out of the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will never approve that source.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may love Ishmael and care for him, but I do not."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the birth of Ishmael, God came in to tell Abraham that he had to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, God also strengthened and confirmed His promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After his circumcision, Abraham had intimate fellowship with God, enjoying the highest experience with God of anyone in history up to that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When, at the time of chapter twenty, the seed still had not come, even such a giant of faith as Abraham could not stand the test.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we saw in the last message, he was apparently bored in his experience of God and took a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham might have said to God, "God, You have promised again and again to give me a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have dealt with me about this and that until I have nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have said no to everything I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now I am bored and would like a change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I want to take a vacation."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham journeyed southward, that is, downward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Like everyone who takes a vacation after working hard, Abraham was seeking easiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of this, he repeated an old failure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God preserved him, creating a situation in which, in spite of his failure, circumstances, and environment, he had to intercede for Abimelech and his house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not one thing was an encouragement to Abraham in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet, being the giant of faith, he interceded, not with boldness or the release of the spirit, but in a shameful way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, his shameful intercession was answered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only did Abimelech's wife and maidservants bear children, but Sarah also gave birth to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One prayer of intercession received two answers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we come to Genesis 21 we see that Abraham has returned from his vacation and is back in business again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter twenty he tried to take a vacation and stay away from his divine job, but he did not succeed and God forced him to make an intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That intercession brought him back from vacation to his divine employment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now, in chapter twenty-one, Abraham is back in his "office."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genesis 21 has two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first section, verses 1 through 13, is thoroughly covered by the Apostle Paul in Galatians 4:22-31, where he allegorizes this portion of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By means of Paul's allegorization, seeking Christians throughout the centuries have been able to learn the true significance of the first part of Genesis 21.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I wish that Paul had allegorized the remainder of that chapter, but he kept silent about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most Christians only consider 21:14-34 as a story of Ishmael's dwelling in the wilderness and becoming an archer and of Abraham's dealing with Abimelech over the well at Beer-sheba, not thinking that this portion of the Word has much spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if the first section of Genesis 21 has a spiritual significance, then the second section must also have a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this message we need to cover the significance of both sections.</S>
