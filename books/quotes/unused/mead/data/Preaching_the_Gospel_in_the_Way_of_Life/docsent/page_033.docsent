   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING PREACHING AS OUR LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need the proper preaching as the very living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not a work; it is a living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are living here for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must do it not just once for our whole life; rather, it must be a regular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not like to speak much about the church in Taipei, but I can testify that after many years of building up, the church there has been brought to this normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are living there for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day by day they are growing, day by day they are being built up, and month after month a good number of people are brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on we all have to learn that to preach the gospel is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is for this very purpose that we are living here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to labor on people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a student you have to work on your classmate and your roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a man working in a business, you have to work on your colleague.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to work on your neighbors, your relatives, and the persons whom you know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must always live for this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This prevailing preaching depends on life, truth, the church, and service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you have these four items, then you will have a strong standing and a prevailing preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that our preaching was only in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, that was only a start.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From now on, we must take preaching as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Week after week, month after month, and year after year we are living here for this to win the world for Christ and win souls for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to do this, we have to be filled with Christ, we have to have light, we have to be in the church, and we have to be functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will be prevailing in our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the third time that I have been in this country, and I have been here for more than three years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christian friends told me that I should not and cannot compare the situation here in the United States with that of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a sense I agree with this, but in another sense I do not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It depends on how much the church lives for preaching and labors for it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we brothers and sisters all would work in this way, we will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen some difference already, but I believe that this is just a small start.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to fight the battle to create the atmosphere of gospel preaching in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should let the community know that we are a group of people living here for people's souls.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I say again, this is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the basic understanding of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE NEED TO COORDINATE IN OUR WORK WITH PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should keep a record of the persons who are interested in receiving the Lord or already have made a decision for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These are the materials we have to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the opportunity for us to be coordinated practically, like a team that plays ball.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to work on these dear ones in a coordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A young sister in school may have two or three classmates that have the desire to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For her to work with them by herself is not adequate; it will not be powerful and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She needs to coordinate with one or two other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the three can work together on these classmates, and within two weeks they all will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They will be saved thoroughly, not only to know Christ but also to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In turn, these three sisters may have some relatives who also are close to believing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may be hard for them to work with their relatives, so a brother may have to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When these four coordinate together, it will be easy to bring in all those relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To keep your relatives and friends in your own hands will be hard for you, and to keep my relatives and friends in my own hands will be hard for me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we coordinate, it will be easy to fight the battle in the Body in a coordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Learn the lesson to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be proud is the most foolish way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say, "I can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not need these poor sisters to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I know everything from Genesis to Revelation, and I know how to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been trained."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if you go to play ball by yourself without a team, how can you win the game?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Learn to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Trust in the Lord, and trust in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever you cannot get through, bring this matter to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you cannot fight the battle, ask the brothers and sisters to come and help.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Learn to ask people to come in to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then you will see the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a spiritual law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you throw something into the air, it falls again because of the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You cannot get around a law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you ask others to come in, you will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Try this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The enemy, the devil and the evil spirits, know the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are not afraid of you as an individual, but if you call one or two brothers to come along with you, the evil spirits will be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Always work two by two, not one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Learn to be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Two brothers can keep the records on file for the men who are new ones, and two sisters can keep the records for the women.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These two brothers must be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They have to read and study the records with prayer to know their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They may consider that a certain brother should coordinate with the one who contacted a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will be a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then that brother can report on his contact with the new one, and if there is a certain difficult situation, a third brother can be brought in to reinforce the other two.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now instead of two, these three will go to work on this person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who coordinate in this way will study the situations of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then they may call on other brothers and sisters to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not say that you do not know how to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I know that you do not know how to do it, but do it by learning.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is by doing it that you learn how.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you never do it, you will never know how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Take the assignment and limitation given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Just like a member of a ball team, you cannot say, "Don't give me the ball."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whether or not you are ready, the ball will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You have to play, because you all are in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not say you are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Learn to accept the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then I assure you that you will receive the blessing not only the blessing in others' salvation, but also in your own growth of life.</S>
