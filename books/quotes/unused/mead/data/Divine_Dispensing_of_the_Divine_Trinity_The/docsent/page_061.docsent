   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit s Access</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christ preaches such a gospel by Himself as the life-giving Spirit, and when we hear and accept such a gospel, what do we receive?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The main thing we receive is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most Christians do not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not think when we receive the gospel we mainly receive forgiveness of sins or justification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The main thing we receive by accepting such a gospel is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose an unbeliever says, Lord Jesus, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are my Savior, and I accept You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, come into my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately, Christ the Preacher, as the Spirit, will enter into that one, and he will receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, verse 18 speaks concerning the Spirit: For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we have the Spirit and are in the Spirit, and the Spirit brings us to the Father, the source.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter two of Ephesians tells us that God loved us, enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies to make us His poem, His masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The God who did this is the Father as the source, acting through a channel, Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that when the Son came; He came in the Father s name John 5:43 ; He came with the Father John 8:29; 16:32 ; the Son was even called the Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father is the source who planned all things, and the Son is the means, the course, who accomplished the Father s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ became the channel in which and the means by which God enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 2 reveals God as the Father and Christ as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After His death and resurrection, Christ the Son came as the Spirit to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit came, He came with the Father John 15:26 and note 26 1 in the Son s name John 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That means when the Spirit came, the Son came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, when the Son comes to preach the gospel to us, the Spirit also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we receive the Son in His preaching, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit then brings us back to the Father through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through this wonderful two-way traffic we enjoy the threefold dispensing of life by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first issue of the divine dispensing is that we are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God v. 19 . Also, the Gentile believers are being built together with the Jewish believers upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone v. 20 . Such a building has the wonderful Christ as the joining cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This building is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, a holy dwelling place of God v. 21 . This indicates that the holy temple is a living building, for a physical building does not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to enlarge a material structure we need to build something further.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the church as God s building grows because it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church grows by life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The threefold God God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Spirit is dispensing Himself into us as life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as He is dispensing Himself into us, we are nourished and we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He dispenses, and we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the building of the church into a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, the word temple here should be translated sanctuary, meaning the central part of the temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a sanctuary is God s dwelling place in our spirit v. 22 . The church life today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Practically speaking, when you are out of your spirit, you are out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are not in your spirit, although you may be in the meeting, you are not in the church in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church life is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must always turn to our spirt, exercise our spirit, and walk according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be out of our spirit nor have our being apart from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must walk, live, act, and have our being in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we exercise our spirit in this way, we are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is for God s dispensing of Himself into us as life so that we may grow in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both God s dispensing and our growing are in the spirit.</S>
