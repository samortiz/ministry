   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not easy for a person with a small heart to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is rare for a small-hearted person to have genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anyone who has faith has a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From God s point of view, our faith is as small as a mustard seed Luke 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, every matter related to faith is immeasurably great.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mustard seed is small, but the issue of such a small seed is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A small amount of faith can produce a great result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our faith depends on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our heart is large, we will spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may speak of faith as being large or small, but a small-hearted person does not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only a large-hearted person has faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our heart is large, we do not need to plan how to take care of our living or how to pay for our expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A large-hearted person does not worry about such minor items.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the kind of help that we receive from reading the biography of spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hudson Taylor and others who were used by God did not have banks or committees to support their work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a reason that we should learn to have a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once our heart is enlarged, it will be easy for us to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The larger our heart is, the more faith we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our faith will be so immeasurable that we will believe that God can do extraordinary things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, no one can encourage or force us to have such faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having faith that trusts in God depends on our heart being enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The population of the world has increased over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though the rate of increase is constantly accelerating, people today do not necessarily live in a poorer condition than people in the ancient days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The larger a population is, the greater the financial pressure, but it seems that people are even wealthier.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the population of Taiwan is ten million, and it increases yearly by three hundred thousand people, which is the population of the city of Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This poses a problem to the government in Taiwan, because in ten years the population increase will be ten times the population of Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, the population increase is exponential; more people beget more children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, in ten years there may be a yearly increase of four hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not worry about how these people will live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Taiwan will probably be more prosperous by then.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the numbers are in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God allows people to be poor or rich.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether a person is poor or rich is in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can control this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never consider how poor the saints are or how impoverished the place is where we labor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we consider these matters, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when we are financially pressed on every side with no way out, our help comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is beyond our expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we need living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A mustard seed may be small in size, but because it is living, it can produce great results.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Living faith depends on a heart that is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A believer who is specialized does not have much potential before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter how much he endeavors to learn, he will not be useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His primary need is to allow God to enlarge his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once the heart is enlarged, it is easy to have living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A worker should believe in God s grace and mercy and not in his planning or imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What God measures out to us is not according to our expectation, and it is beyond our calculations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we allow God to work in us and enlarge our heart, it will be easy for us to have faith that grows and is living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of being influenced by the environment, we will receive God s mercy to see that all things in the universe are in His hand for the accomplishment of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s special mercy and blessing exceed our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we would work for the Lord and be useful in His hand, we must have living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should learn to receive a burden from the Lord; that is, to receive His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot receive a burden if we have a small heart, do not have faith, and only walk by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if God gives us a vision and a burden, we will not receive it if our heart is small.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have a small heart and no faith, the vision with the burden that comes from the Lord will simply vanish like a fleeting cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not that God does not give us a vision but that we do not receive it, because our heart is small and we lack faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s vision and burden are great, but if our heart is too small to receive them, our usefulness will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God gives faith and enlarges our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When our heart is large, it is easy to have living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Living faith enables us to receive God s commission, God s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This has everything to do with our function and our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Billy Graham was raised up by the Lord less than ten years ago and is not yet forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason he is able to carry out his work is that he has a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is young, competent, and steady, not proud or arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His large heart gives him a living faith that enables him to receive the burden of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The burden he received is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some orthodox Christians in America are unreasonable in opposing Billy Graham.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without the proper view from God, a doctrine may be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God asked the prophets to do things that seemed unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For example, He asked the prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute Hosea 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hosea could only follow this command, even though he would be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some believers are opposed to Billy Graham and his crusades because even people from heretical groups attend the crusades.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Billy Graham, however, cares only that people hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He does not care who hears the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He would preach the gospel even if the devil attended a crusade.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This shows that Billy Graham has an enlarged heart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He stands with God and preaches the word to whoever attends.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He does not try to please people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He has living faith and receives his burden from God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Spirit affirms his labor with a strong result and supplies him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This does not mean, however, that we should imitate him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In principle, we should receive help from others, but we are accountable to God for our work.</S>
