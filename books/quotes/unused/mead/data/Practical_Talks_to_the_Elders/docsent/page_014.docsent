   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LACK OF FRUIT AMONG US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I give you this background so you will know why I have picked up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the twenty years I have been in this country, I took no interest in the Chinese side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since last year my concept has changed a little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I still have no burden to build a Chinese work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My burden, my ministry, is to build the local churches in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the Chinese-speaking side, my burden is simply to make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just in California alone among us there are over five hundred Chinese saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps half can manage the English language; these are the ones who graduated from schools in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The rest know only the simplest English.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They cannot express themselves in the prayer meeting and at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They cannot understand much of the spoken messages, so they have lacked nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Due to this, some have left and gone to Chinese meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many of these, even here in Orange County.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Vancouver I have heard of one such meeting where there are eight hundred Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brother who raised it up was with us in Hong Kong before joining the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I felt shameful when I heard this story.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have had a church in Vancouver for years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet this brother, who learned so little from us, could bring in eight hundred by himself to listen to him in the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Rosemead, which is a continuation of Elden, there are only a hundred sixty Chinese plus eighty non-Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider how many years we were in Elden, yet our numbers are so few compared to this other work in Vancouver.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What has been the fruit of all our work?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>San Jose has many good opportunities, yet nothing has been done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother from Taiwan was in San Francisco for a couple of years, and another was in Berkeley, yet nothing seemed to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has disappointed me; it is a shame to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why, when our brothers came, could they not do anything, but when others came, they could accomplish so much?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am more than busy, but I have been forced to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEED FOR PROPER COOKING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Doctrinally speaking, we are not short of spiritual groceries to feed the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I don t mean that we are a seminary, offering different courses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I mean we are a great family, with groceries to feed our people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you know of any groceries that we lack?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please tell me if you do, and I will endeavor to make up the shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems to me we have more than is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in our cooking there is a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have been to the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have traveled throughout the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The meetings I have attended have usually included the giving of a message, followed by the sharing of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The messages are largely repetitions of the Life-study messages, presented in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, when it is time for the saints to share, what they have to say, because of the lack of proper cooking, generally lacks the focus of the central goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have given about three thousand messages in this country, all focused on the central lane of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The proper cooking in the churches first of all requires that the leading ones get into the messages on the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I mean that they should live, experience, practice those messages.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then you will be able to do more than just repeat them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your speaking will be your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when you present to the saints what you have experienced have you done the proper cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basic point of the proper cooking is this: the leading ones need the practical experience of the words on the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, the three thousand messages were on the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Still, for anything to exist it needs skin and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot experience the skin and the bones; you must experience the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need for you to repeat a message which has already been given.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is needed is your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then when you give a message, you present your experience of it and the way in which you have experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will bring the saints to focus on the central lane and help them to practice living the points of God s focus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such a message will provide the help for them to live in the experience of the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These two things to experience and to help others to experience will take much time to practice, to learn, and to pray over.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the present stage of the churches, our meeting should be to train, instruct, help every saint to get into life, the living, of the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This cannot be done in even one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the system of universal education illustrates, a course of study takes three or four years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Elementary school takes six years, then junior and senior high take three years each, and then a college course of study needs four years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To help a church get into the practical living of the central lane, to set up a foundation, will take about four years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The brothers of the church in Anaheim realized last fall that I was unhappy with the church meetings here.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The meetings had no goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was like attending class after class in a university without being able to figure out what the course was about.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The classes were just a waste; not only a waste, but even a damage to the appetite.</S>
