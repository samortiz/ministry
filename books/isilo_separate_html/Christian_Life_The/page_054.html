THE COMPOUND SPIRIT BEING<br>THE REALITY OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION<br>AND APPLYING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST<br>TO CHRIST'S MEMBERS THROUGH THE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE ANOINTING</H2><P>The compound Spirit is the reality of Christ's resurrection and applies the resurrection of Christ to Christ's members through the dispensing of the divine anointing (Rom. 8:11, 13b; 1 John 2:20, 27). The all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ. If you have this Spirit, you are in the resurrection of Christ. If you do not have this Spirit, the resurrection of Christ has nothing to do with you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE BELIEVERS OF CHRIST<br>KNOWING CHRIST THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE<br>OF THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</H2><P>The believers of Christ should know Christ through the experience of the power of His resurrection which conforms them to His death in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).</P><P>All of the above organic items concerning the all-inclusive resurrection of Christ are mysterious and invisible, yet they are real. For example, our physical life is real, and it is working all the time, yet we are not aware of it. When we are healthy, our organic, physical life is active and working all day long, but we are not aware of its working. On the other hand, when we are sick, we are full of feeling that something is wrong. It is the same with the working of the organic, divine life within us. Christ is within us as the pneumatic One, as the compounded One, with God's divinity, Christ's humanity, and all the elements of Christ's person, of His death, and of His resurrection. Something organic is going on within us that we cannot fully understand, yet it is so real. This is altogether the moving, the acting, and the working of the pneumatic Christ who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit. We need to know Christ through the experience of the power of His all-inclusive resurrection, with which the all-inclusive Spirit has been compounded.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
