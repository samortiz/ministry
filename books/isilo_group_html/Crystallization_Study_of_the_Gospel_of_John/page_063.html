A Divine and Human Constitution</H2><P>The issue of Christ's glorification is a divine and human constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified elect as an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God (John 14:7-20). This kind of constitution is organic, with the divine life and the human life transformed with the divine life. These two lives are constituted together to become a divine and human constitution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Father Embodied in the Son</H2><P>The Father is embodied in the Son, coinhering with the Son, and seen among the believers (vv. 7-11). The Son said that He was in the Father and the Father was in Him. This is not just coexisting but coinhering&#151;coexisting one within another mutually. The Christian life is actually a life of coinherence because we are in Christ and Christ is in us. We and He are coinhering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Son Being Realized as the Spirit</H2><P>The Son is realized as the Spirit to abide in the believers (vv. 15-20). The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and abide in us; therefore, we are "four-in-one," a divine and human constitution. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and They are all in us. God and man are united, mingled, and incorporated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Source, the Element, the Essence,<br>and the Constituents</H2><P>In this constitution God the Father is the source, God the Son is the element, and God the Spirit is the essence, constituted with the believers as the constituents (Eph. 4:4-6). Every substance has a source and an element, and every element has its essence. The essence is the intrinsic part of the element, the element is the reality of the substance, and the substance has a source. God is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. We the believers are just the constituents containing the source, the element, and the essence to be a divine and human constitution. This divine and human constitution is expressed as the Father's house in John 14, the Son's vine in John 15, and the Spirit's child in John 16.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
