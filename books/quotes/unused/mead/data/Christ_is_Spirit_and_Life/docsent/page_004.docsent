   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"It is the Spirit who gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But what is this life that the Spirit gives?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that there are many forms of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this world there are the plant life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The plant life is lower and the animal life is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even higher than these two kinds of life is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, various forms of plant life and animal life abound on this earth, and men with the human life also fill the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these forms of life are wonderful; but there is a fourth kind of life the divine life, which is God's uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lower life exists for the higher life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the plant life exists for the animal life and supports the animal life, and the animal life is for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same principle, the human life exists for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, the plant life, the animal life, and the human life are merely shadows and pictures of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The beauty of the spring flowers points to the beauty of the divine life; the luxuriance of the forests is a picture of the abundance of the divine life; and the wisdom of the human life is a picture of the intelligence of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the characteristics of this highest life?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, this life of God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being divine means being of God, having the nature of God, and being transcendent and distinct from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God is divine, so His life is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, God's life is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's life is uncreated; it has no beginning and no end. All of us were born at a certain time and on a certain day, and all of us realize that our human life will have a definite ending in death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God's life has no beginning, and it will continue in perpetuity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For centuries men have tried to build machines that will prolong their lives, but none has succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God is self-existing and ever-existing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His life is unfailing and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's eternal life not only endures forever, but in quality it is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This eternal life is also indestructible and indissoluble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A piece of soap can be dissolved by placing it in water, and even gold and silver can be dissolved in some solutions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But nothing can dissolve the indestructible life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will remain the same forever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you put the human life into the grave, it will soon decay and decompose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if you put the eternal life into the grave, the grave will burst.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you place this life in any negative situation, that situation will be powerless to hold it down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The eternal life of God is an indestructible life, and nothing on earth, in heaven, or in hell can destroy it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the life that Christ as the Spirit gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is much better than the religion that man has invented.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Gospel of John this life is seen to overcome all kinds of human weaknesses and swallow up all kinds of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter three of John there is a religious person named Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wanted the Lord only to teach him to be moral and to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord showed him that what was wrong with him was not his outward, wrong behavior, but a wrong life that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What he needed was another life the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This religious man had been born once of the human life, but now he needed to be born again of another life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The divine life does not improve our own life but regenerates us with another life.</S>
