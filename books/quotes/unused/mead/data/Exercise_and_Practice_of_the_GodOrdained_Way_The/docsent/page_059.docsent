   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING ACCORDING TO THE NEW ONES' NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Right after their baptism, we must help the new ones in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we should not do this in a legal way as if we were using a textbook: first, lesson one, then lesson two, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have a spirit that is very free and which can sense the feelings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then when we come to the new ones to have a home meeting in their home, we should not have a subject that we have already decided to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That will kill the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can sing, pray, or praise to make ourselves so released and also to release others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this, the new ones will open up to us and say something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By listening to them, we can sense their feelings about their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we can speak something to them that is according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A new one may say, "In these two days since my baptism, I have not had any peace within."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What should you say?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you were to say something concerning consecration because you had prepared this subject for the meeting, that would not fit and would not meet this new one's need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must follow the spirit to speak something to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is best not to speak something too quickly, but first ask him why he did not have peace within for these two days.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There must be some reason.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his answer you may find out the cause of his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He might say that after he was baptized, he began to think of his father and of what his father might feel concerning his becoming a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now you know the cause of his being troubled and can speak something to meet his need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes you need to ask the new ones a question in order to find out something, but do not ask too many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is better to solve one question at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This new one is troubled when he considers his father; he may feel that his father might rebuke him or reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your answer will depend upon your learning, your knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may use Acts 16:31: "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You can read this verse to him and tell him, "This is a great promise to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All believers have the right to expect that their whole family will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You do not need to worry about your father; you have to believe the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sooner or later your father will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way you can strengthen him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Four crucial practices of the Christian life are reading the Bible, praying always, keeping morning watch, and attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It would be marvelous if we could cover these four crucial practices in two home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Reading the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although you may have strengthened and encouraged a new one, this alone is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You still have to grasp the time to go further, to speak something more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should not go to a home meeting with a prepared subject, but you must have a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have a purpose in going to a home meeting is different from making a decision as to what you are going to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are going to visit a man who was baptized only two days ago, you must have a burden, a purpose, to feed, or nourish, him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say, "This verse, Acts 16:31, is very good and comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word is straight and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We Christians should know the verses in the Bible, so we need to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the first day that we believe in the Lord Jesus, we must pick up the practice of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Timothy 3:15-16 says, From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation .All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.'"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you can fellowship with him and charge him to set aside some time to read the Bible every day.</S>
