   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Timothy 5:19-20 says, "Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Timothy was charged by the Apostle Paul to receive an accusation against an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the apostles have authority to deal with the elders even after they have been appointed by the apostles to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is a problem among the elders, this case should go to the apostles, and the apostles have to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles have the authority to rebuke a sinful elder in front of others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostles' hands should be off of the church in its administration, but this does not mean that the apostles have absolutely nothing to do with a local church after its elders have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wrong and sinful elders can be accused by the saints, and this accusation should go to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, the apostles become a small law court to judge the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 1 Corinthians 6 even the saints can form a small law court to judge cases among themselves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostles should make a judgment in cases regarding the alleged wrongdoing of certain elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is up to the apostles to justify or condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to 1 Timothy 5:20, if an elder is judged to be sinful, he can be reproved before the others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based upon Paul's word to Timothy in this matter, how can we say that the apostles, who appointed the elders and handed over the church to them, have nothing to do with the church or the elders once they have been established?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entire book of 1 Corinthians is a "bothering book."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The writing apostle bothered the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire book may be considered as a commandment to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 11:34 says, "If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even after charging the church to take care of so many things, Paul says that he will set in order the remaining matters when he comes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to come back to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Word is our highest authority, our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse tells us that some things were not set in order by the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In his Epistle to the church in Corinth, many things were set in order by Paul's charges, such as the matters of marriage, the eating of sacrifices to idols, head covering, the Lord's table, etc. Paul charged the Corinthians to deal with at least eleven problems in his fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He charged the church to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the apostle he did not have the position to administrate the church, but he did have the position, right, and responsibility to charge the elders to do it.</S>
