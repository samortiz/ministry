   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REACHING PEOPLE BY GOING TO WHERE THEY ARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I have no intention to stir up a so-called revival.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In over sixty years of Christian experience, I have found that the way of big revivals does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What really works is the way ordained by God and revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The God-ordained way to preach the gospel is by every believer going to visit people to preach the gospel to them personally and directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament charges us to "go!"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must go to reach people by visiting them where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To visit people for the gospel preaching is not merely to knock on doors; it is to reach people where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus Himself went to reach people Matt 4:18-22; 9:9; John 4:1-42 , and He also sent the twelve to do the same Luke 9:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He sent seventy to go into every city and place to find the homes of the sons of peace Luke 10:1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Physically speaking, as one person, the Lord could not go to many villages to visit that many people, so He sent the seventy to do this visiting work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic principle in preaching the gospel is for you to go to people; do not ask them to come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you will go to them, you will see that this makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Go to a sinner's home to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sit down with him and talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Take the lead to pray with him, asking him to follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you could say: "Because you have prayed to the Lord Jesus and have believed in Him, you are now qualified to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us baptize you in the bathtub."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is absolutely different from inviting people to come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many of the saints have been quite successful in preaching the gospel in this God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING FLEXIBLE IN OUR WAY OF REACHING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be flexible in our way of reaching people in the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does it mean to be flexible?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Human beings are very legalistic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We easily make everything a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the full-time training in Taipei, because there were so many large high-rise apartment buildings, we instructed the trainees to always turn to the left after leaving a door.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In that kind of building, there might be over eighty units on one floor, so this kind of instruction helped the trainees make efficient use of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in the United States, we do not have so many large high-rise apartment buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people live in single houses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To rigidly practice this kind of "turning to the left" in the United States may not work so well because the situation is quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best way for the saints to visit homes is to form teams.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ideally, a team should have three persons, one older, one younger, and one middle-aged, with either one sister and two brothers or one brother and two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in the United States, many have taken this as a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we could not get an older one or a younger one, we would not form a team.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, nothing is done because of our legality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must learn to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that I am annulling my previous fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you practice those things, they will work; but it all depends upon the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>DIFFERENT WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that the only way to reach people is by going as a team of three.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many ways to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this message, I will present a number of different ways to reach people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Visiting Our Close Relatives</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first and best way is to visit your close relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose you go to visit your grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although your grandfather loves you, he may not listen to you, so you should take some mature brothers with you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then when you go to visit your grandfather, he will listen to these brothers and get saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What you could not do in twenty-five years of preaching to him, these brothers could do in a short visit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You also have many other relatives to reach with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should make a list of all your relatives and go to visit each one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You do not need to knock on strangers' doors.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A stranger may slam the door in your face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those are "cold doors."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You better go first to the "warm doors."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your close relatives would never slam the door.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have the right to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are so many "warm doors," so many close relatives, for us to visit with the gospel.</S>
