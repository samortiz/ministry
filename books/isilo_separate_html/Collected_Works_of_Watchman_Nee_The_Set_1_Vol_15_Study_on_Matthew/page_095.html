The word of the Lord endures longer than heaven and earth. This means that before heaven and earth pass away, His words will be fulfilled. The word "heaven" has two usages: (1) In the singular it means heaven in contrast to the earth. (2) In the plural it means the kingdom in which the Lord rules, which is the universe. Here it is singular.</P><P>Verses 36-42 are a small section and are most difficult to explain.</P><P>Verse 36:"But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only." "That day and hour." The "day" is longer and "the hour" is shorter. It seems that the Lord categorized the things of the future as to day and hour. The disciples asked concerning: (1) the sign of His coming ( parousia) and (2) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord used the fig tree as the sign of the consummation of the age and our rapture as the sign of the parousia. The Jews' fig tree is a sign to us, and our rapture is a sign to the Jews. Although there is a sign for one to know, the day and the hour cannot be known, because the Lord said that no man knows. But, regrettably, today there are many people who try to calculate the day and the hour. Some people do not calculate the day and the hour, but they calculate the year and the month. This is not godly. Mrs. White of the Seventh-day Adventists calculated that the coming of the Lord would be in 1844. Mr. Russell of the Russellites (Jehovah's Witnesses) calculated that it would be in the 1800s. Both of them were wrong. Every year some people make some assertions, but they all fail. Even the angels of heaven do not know. Neither does the Son know. This seems strange. In Hebrews 1:13 and Psalms 110:1 the Father told the Lord, "Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." The Lord today is waiting; He does not need to know. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are triune, the Son would rather wait and not know. It is not that He cannot know. Archbishop Trench said that the words "but the Father only" can be translated "if not the Father only," that is, "If the Father does not know, man would not know, angels would not know, and even the Son would not know." But this does not make sense. My personal opinion is that the Lord meant in verse 36 that at that time only the Father knew, and that all the rest did not know. The word "knows" in "no one knows" is in the present tense. Today the Lord does know, but man cannot tell the time when He will know. Some people say that although "knows" is in the present tense, it means "will never know." I cannot agree with this. If that is the case, the Lord Jesus will never know.</P><P>Verses 37 through 42:There are four things in these verses: (1) At the end time man's condition will be very much as it was in the days of Noah. At that time, even though men knew that the flood was about to come (as it had been preached by Noah), they still would not be awakened; they continued eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage as usual. (2) As God kept the household of Noah from the destruction of the flood, so God will also preserve the remnant of the Jews to pass through the great tribulation. (This is what is spoken of in Revelation: the earth opened up her mouth to swallow up the flood of water from the dragon-12:16.) (3) The flood took the rest of the people away. (4) As in the day that Noah entered into the ark when the flood came, at the time of rapture, one will be taken and the other left.</P><P>Verse 37: "For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be." There were seven things in the days of Noah: (1) After Enosh was born, men began to call on the name of Jehovah. From this we know that, although men worshipped God prior to Enosh's time, they did not worship Jehovah. There is a difference between worshipping God and worshipping Jehovah. Not to worship Jehovah is not to worship Jehovah the Savior. Likewise, men today believe that there is a God, but they do not believe that Jehovah is God, much less that Christ is God. (2) In Genesis 4:19 and 22, the names of the women recorded include Adah ("ornament"), Zillah ("shadow"), and Naamah ("pleasant"). These three names represent the beauty, vainglory, silliness, and frivolity of the women of those days. Today, women's adornments and cosmetics are selling exceptionally well. Women love to be vain and frivolous. This tells the believers that the day of Noah is approaching. (3) Genesis 4:17 says that "he builded a city," and verses 20-22 speak of music, husbandry, and metal-working. Today all these are very flourishing. In the area of music, there are the gramophones and the radios. At that time iron was for making knives and swords; today it is for guns and cannons. (4) With regard to the church's degradation, before the flood there were two lines that God especially paid attention to. They were the line of Cain, representing the world, and the line of Seth, representing the church. But in the line of Seth, Enoch was the only one who was raptured. The rest did not walk with God but mixed with the world instead and failed. Today's church also mixes with the world; it is indeed degraded. If one does not see that the church is degraded, he himself has already become degraded! (5) In Genesis 6:1 men began to multiply, and it is the same today. The rate of population increase has grown rapidly. Just three years ago (1930) there were 1.7 billion people; today there are 2 billion. Today in China alone there are 500 million. (6) Jude 14 and 15 say that Enoch prophesied the word of the Lord's coming and judgment, yet many people ignored it. Today's situation is exactly the same. Since 1828 there have been some who preached the word of the Lord's second coming, yet very few have accepted it. (7) Of particular importance is Genesis 6:2. The sons of God (angels) became fallen and took the daughters of men as wives. Today it is just the same. Spiritualism has become very popular. Communication with demons and with the dead has become very convincing. After the European War [World War I], many women in France became pregnant by evil spirits. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (of the Royal Society) was promoting spiritualism very aggressively. No one dared to speak of these seven things in the past hundred years because there was no light.</P><P>Verse 38:"For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark." Are the events concerning Noah a sign of the rapture of the saints or of the believers' passing through the tribulation? It is more accurate to say that they typify the rapture of the believers. Generally, it is assumed that Enoch typifies the rapture, whereas Noah typifies the believers' passing through the tribulation, because this is according to the facts in Genesis. However, the sign of Noah does not typify only one thing. What did the Lord say in Matthew 24:37? Here the Lord spoke of His parousia. The parousia in verse 37 is equal to Noah's ark in verse 38. The one of every male and female entering into the ark to escape the flood are the raptured ones. The event of Noah's entering into the ark typifies the rapture. Consider the following: (1) Noah (typifying the Lord) brought one male and one female of every animal into the ark. The Lord also will lead one male and one female into the rapture section of the parousia. (2) Noah shut the animals inside the ark; the world did not see them. When Christ raptures us, the world will not see us either. (3) Noah rescued them from the flood. Likewise, the Lord will also keep us from the great tribulation (Rev. 3:10). The animals could represent men, as they did in the vision that Peter saw. At that time, men gave themselves to eating, drinking, and marrying. Today it is the same. Men eat and drink lavishly. The giving in marriage also is increasing.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_094.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_096.html">Next</a> </body></html>
