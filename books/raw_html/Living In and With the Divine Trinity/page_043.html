<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Abiding in the Lord</H2><P>We need to be those abiding in the Lord (1 John 2:6). To abide in the Triune God is to abide in the Lord. The Lord is the One who possesses all things, who rules over all things, who exercises His sovereignty over all things and over all people. We are living in the One who is the Lord of this universe. If we are not obedient to Him or do not subject ourselves to Him, that will annul our abiding in Him. To abide in Christ is to abide in the Lord.</P><P>To abide in the vine tree implies a daily life. We need to consider the branches of the vine tree. They are having their "daily life" in the vine tree. We need to have our daily life in the Lord. This means that we have to obey Him and that we have to walk in the same way that He walked. As a man, He walked under God's authority. We also need to walk under His authority, submitting ourselves to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Abiding in the Son</H2><P>We also need to be those abiding in the Son (1 John 2:24b). In the New Testament, the Son is the One who possesses the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father. The sons have the full right to enjoy all the privileges and rights ascribed to the sonship. When we are abiding in the Son, we enjoy our Father's life, our Father's nature, and the privilege, the right, to express Him and to enjoy all His possessions. To abide in the Lord concerns the lordship of Christ. To abide in the Son concerns the sonship of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Abiding in the Father</H2><P>We also need to be those who are abiding in the Father (1 John 2:24c). How good it is to have a Father! Our Father is all capable. Our Father is always living. Our Father never gets old. He takes care of us in every way and in everything. If a person loses his father, he becomes an orphan. Thank the Lord that God is our Father and that we are not orphans but sons. We are not only abiding in Christ as the organism of the Triune God, in the Lord with His lordship, and in the Son with His sonship, but also in the Father with all His care. When we are living in the Triune God, we are living as sons, not orphans. We have a Father. We live in the One who takes care of us.</P><P>Our abiding in the Son and in the Father are both mentioned in 1 John 2:24. When we have the Son, we have the Father because the Son and the Father are one. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father (John 14:10). When we abide in the Son, we abide in the Father. Our experiences confirm this fact. While we are abiding in the Son, we have the sensation that the Father is with us. We have the Lord and we have the Father. We have the Son with the Father. When we abide in the Son, we enjoy the fatherhood because the Father is there.</P>
