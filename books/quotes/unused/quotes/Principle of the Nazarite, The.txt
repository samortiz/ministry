All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin
In the beginning of the book of Numbers, the Lord told Moses how to coordinate these different people into one army to fight the battle
While He was telling Moses how to coordinate these people, the Lord gave Moses a supplement in chapter six of Numbers
According to the Bible, a priest is one who opens himself to the Lord so that the Lord may be mingled with him
Besides His ordination of the house of Aaron as priests, He provided a supplement in the sixth chapter of Numbers
Even the sisters need not be bothered that all the priests in the Old Testament were men; the side door is open to both men and women
During normal times, the main entrance is sufficient, but when the times are abnormal, the side door is necessary
It is not a matter of being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but of voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him
At the time of Eli, the Lord was really poor as far as the priesthood was concerned; so Hannah lent Samuel to Him
When things are abnormal, causing the Lord to be poor in His administration, someone needs to voluntarily lend himself to the Lord
Samuel was not even of the house of Aaron, but he became a priest by being consecrated, separated, and lent to the Lord
He became a priest according to the supplement provided in Numbers 6, not according to an appointment or ordination
In addition to this, Samuel was also a prophet, who turned the age into the age of the kingdom with the kingship
There was the priesthood, the authority, the prophethood, and the turning of the age of degradation into the age of the kingdom
By regeneration all Christians have become priests and kings, but nearly all of them have been spoiled by the wine of earthly enjoyment
The Lord's recovery can only be prevailing with the priesthood which is entirely separated from earthly pleasures and worldly enjoyment
We must overcome our natural affections and not be affected by our mother, our father, our sister, or even our wife or husband
We may have overcome our natural affections, but suppose one day in the church life a brother standing by us dies very suddenly
You do not exercise yourself to taste the good things, but to enjoy the trash can-the gossip, the criticism, and the murmuring
We must volunteer to be a Nazarite, such as Samuel, who turned the age of degradation into the age of the kingdom
