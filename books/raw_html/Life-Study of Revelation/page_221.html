<h2 class="head2">A. The Thrones and the Judgments</h2><p>Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.&rdquo; The word <i>they</i> refers to the overcomers. They are now sitting upon thrones, and authority to judge has been given to them. To have the authority to judge means to have the kingdom (cf. Dan. 7:10, 18, 22). Therefore, this verse indicates that the overcomers have received the kingdom and are enjoying it.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Overcoming Believers<br />Being the Co-kings of Christ<br />for a Thousand Years</h2><p>Verse 4 also says, &ldquo;And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast nor his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&rdquo; Those who have been &ldquo;beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God&rdquo; are the martyrs throughout the church age, as mentioned in 6:9. Undoubtedly, Peter, Paul, James, Stephen, and the many others slain throughout the centuries will be included in this number. These saints, martyred for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, will be resurrected to be co-kings of Christ.</p><p>The martyrs in the great tribulation are those who do not worship the beast nor his image and do not receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand. After the rapture of the overcomers, many saints will be martyred because they refuse to worship Antichrist or to receive his mark on their forehead or on their hand. These martyred saints will also be resurrected to be co-kings in the millennial kingdom.</p><p>In principle, these co-kings must also include the raptured living overcomers. If those in the man-child will be among the co-kings, then certainly those making up the firstfruit will be also.</p><p>In both Matthew 25:21 and 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.&rdquo; These verses refer to the enjoyment of the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. To the diligent servant the Lord will say, &ldquo;Well done! Come into the joy of your Lord. I have some things I want you to rule over.&rdquo; This will be the enjoyment of the overcoming believers in the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The First Resurrection</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Best Resurrection</h2><p>The overcomers will enjoy the best resurrection. Verse 6 speaks of &ldquo;the first resurrection.&rdquo; The Greek word translated <i>first</i> is the same word translated <i>best</i> in Luke 15:22, where the father said in relation to the returned prodigal, &ldquo;Bring out the best robe and put it on him.&rdquo; Hence, the first resurrection in verse 6 may actually be translated &ldquo;the best resurrection.&rdquo; The overcomers will enjoy this resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Ex-resurrection</h2><p>The first resurrection is also the ex-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection which the apostle Paul sought for (Phil. 3:11). The Greek word may be translated as &ldquo;the out-resurrection.&rdquo; This means that it is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection, the resurrection with honor, comparable to graduation with honors. This resurrection is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. Hence, &ldquo;Blessed is he who has part in the first resurrection&rdquo; (20:6). Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living ones, such as the firstfruit in 14:1-5, have part in this resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Resurrection of Life</h2><p>When I was young, I thought that only believers would be resurrected and that unbelievers would not be resurrected. It seemed to me that resurrection was a special blessing granted to the believers. Eventually I learned that the unbelievers will also be resurrected. John 5:29 speaks of &ldquo;the resurrection of life&rdquo; and &ldquo;the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium, and the resurrection of judgment is the resurrection of the unsaved after the millennium. The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of life. But all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne (20:11-15). Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment.</p>
