   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20, 26; 12:24b; 1 Pet 1:3; 2 Cor 5:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we have covered both the objective and the subjective aspects of the Man-Savior s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the subjective aspect, we have seen that Christ s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers, His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into His believers for their regeneration, and His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This message is the conclusion to the series of messages on the subjective aspect of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The concluding point is that the Man-Savior s resurrection issues in His living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result of the Man-Savior s transfiguration, germination, and propagation is that He lives in His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S LIVING IN HIS BELIEVERS Germinating the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through resurrection the Man-Savior was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He entered into us to germinate us, the old creation, so that we might become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This term the new creation is used by Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:17: So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The old creation includes the heavens, the earth, billions of items, and mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the new creation includes only the chosen and redeemed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s people once were the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when Christ as the life-giving Spirit entered into us, we were germinated with the Triune God to become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This germination depends on a germ and the germ with which the resurrected Christ has germinated us is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although this term may not sound pleasant to your ears, it is nevertheless the truth that the Triune God is the germ with which the pneumatic Christ has germinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah, we all have been germinated with the divine germ!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a fact that, as those who have been germinated with the Triune God, we have this divine germ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we have been germinated through the Man-Savior s resurrection, we have been regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Reproduction of the Pneumatic Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Man-Savior s germination of the new creation is His propagation, His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Gospels we have the one Christ, the unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in John 20, after the breathing of the life-giving Spirit as the breath into the disciples, there were at least one hundred twenty-one Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to chapter one of Acts, these one hundred twenty-one the one hundred twenty disciples plus the Lord Jesus had a long prayer meeting lasting ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 1 one hundred twenty-one Christs met together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then on the day of Pentecost, another three thousand were germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one Christ first became one hundred twenty-one Christs, and then three thousand one hundred twenty-one Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This germination is actually the reproduction of the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of Pentecost Christ was living within three thousand one hundred twenty of His members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ who was living in them was the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This pneumatic Christ is the very Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we should speak not of the resurrected Christ but of the Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ Himself is resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ in resurrection is the resurrection itself, and this resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not in the life-giving Spirit, you are not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if you are in the life-giving Spirit, you are in resurrection.</S>
