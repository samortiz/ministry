[1]  The Enjoyment of Christ for the Body in 1 Corinthians CONTENTS
[2]  Enjoying Christ Practically as the Life-giving Spirit to Be One Spirit with Him
[3]  THE CRUCIFIED AND RESURRECTED CHRIST BEING GOD S WISDOM AND GOD S POWER TO US
[4]  Moreover, to the called ones, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . Verse 30 says, Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[5]  Eye has not seen and ear has not heard the deep and hidden things pertaining to Christ as God s wisdom, nor have these things come up in man s heart, but God has prepared them for those who love Him and has revealed them by means of the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit 2:9-12 .
[6]  Similarly, in order for Christ to be our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we must see that today Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[7]  In the New Testament the Lord Jesus told His disciples that they needed to eat Him and drink Him John 6:35, 48, 51, 54, 57; 4:14; 7:37-39 .
[8]  EATING CHRIST AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD AND DRINKING HIM AS OUR SPIRITUAL DRINK
[9]  First Corinthians 10:3 and 4 say, All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.
[10]  However, in 1 Corinthians 10 Christ as the rock is not mainly for our redemption but for our drinking and enjoyment.
[11]  CHAPTER THREE THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST ISSUING IN THE CORPORATE CHRIST,
[12]  After all the teachings of the preceding chapters, verses 6 and 7 say, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
[13]  Since Christ has come down from heaven and come up from the abyss, we may say that Christ today is on the earth, but this is not specific enough.
[14]  In chapter 2 Christ is the deep things of God vv.
[15]  Christ is also the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church 3:10-11 , our Passover feast for our enjoyment 5:7-8 , and our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock 10:3-4 , which are the seventh through eleventh items of Christ s riches in 1 Corinthians.
[16]  By calling, O Lord Jesus, we enjoy Him as the power and wisdom of God, as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and as the deep things of God, the foundation, the Passover, and our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock.
[17]  Christ is the Head of every man 11:3a , the firstfruits 15:20, 23 , the second man v. 47b , the last Adam, and the life-giving Spirit v. 45b . Since Christ is the first, the second, and the last, He is everything, and He is every member of the Body.
[18]  The mystical Body of Christ is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.
[19]  When we partake of the bread at the Lord s table, we are eating not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ.
[20]  As we have seen, 1 Corinthians tells us that we need to enjoy and partake of all the riches of Christ by calling, O Lord Jesus.
[21]  By our calling on this rich Christ, on the Lord who is rich to all, He enters into us, and we digest and assimilate Him so that He comes into every part of our being to be our organic element, even to become us.
[22]  In the church we are enjoying not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.
[23]  Regardless of how much we enjoy Jesus in our personal study of the Bible, we still cannot enjoy the corporate Christ in this way.
[24]  In order to enjoy the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, we need to come to the church meetings.
[25]  In this way we enjoy not only the Head but the Head with the Body, and not only the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.
[26]  All the members are one Body, and this Body is Christ, because in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.
[27]  However, most teachers would not tell us that Christ is the life-giving Spirit or that He is the Body-Christ.
[28]  To enjoy Christ as the power of God is wonderful, but it cannot compare with the enjoyment of Christ as the Body-Christ.
[29]  To enjoy Christ as power is to enjoy Him in one aspect, but to enjoy Him as the Body-Christ is to enjoy Him in fullness.
[30]  If we stay at home, we may be able to enjoy Christ as our power, wisdom, or other items, but in order to enjoy the Body-Christ, we must be in the church.
[31]  It is in the church that we are in the position to drink the Body-Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in the Body.
[32]  Ephesians 4:4 through 6 says, One Body and one Spirit...one Lord...one God and Father of all.
[33]  As we saw in the previous chapter, this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, becomes the Body-Christ 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 12:12-13 .
[34]  The more we say, O Lord Jesus, the more we take the Lord into us, and the more we take Him in, the more He becomes us and we become Him.
[35]  LIVING A LIFE OF ONENESS IN THE CHURCH Putting Our Trust in the Lord
[36]  If the Body does not share our feeling, we should say, Praise the Lord, I am enjoying the Body-Christ, not an individual Christ.
