   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Over Them, through Them, and in Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 4:6 Paul speaks of the "God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "all" refers to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The thought of the Trinity is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Over all" refers mainly to the Father; "through all," to the Son; and "in all," to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God the Father can be in three positions, above all, through all, and in all, because God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even God the Father is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father's position is above all, the Son's position is through all, and the Spirit's position is in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God the Father possesses all the positions of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is above all as the Father, He is through all in the Son, and He is in all as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we see that God the Father is related to the believers in a triune way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His way to be with us is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From experience we know that the Father's triune way to be with the believers is the triune dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we fellowship with the Lord, we may sense that the very God with whom we are fellowshipping is above us and overshadowing us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time we have the sense that this loving One is not only overshadowing us but is also passing through us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we continue our fellowship with Him, we also have the sense that this very One is dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His overshadowing, passing through us, and dwelling in us are all for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way by overshadowing us, by passing through us, and by dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three directions over us, through us, and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever the Father comes to us, He does not come alone but with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, when the Son comes to us with the Father, the Son comes as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Father comes in the Son, and the Son comes as the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, when the Father comes, the Son and the Spirit also come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God the Father visits us, but He always visits us in the Son, who visits us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the Three of the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit visit us in a triune way, in a threefold way, for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 Seen by Them Who Are Pure in Their Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The One who is over us, through us, and in us can be seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory 1 Cor 10:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible, of course, to see God with our physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we can see Him with our spirit and with a heart that is pure and single.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have an open spirit and a pure heart, we shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To see God is an experience and an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we see Him, He dispenses Himself into us, infusing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4 Near to Them Who Draw Near to Him</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God the Father is not only seen by those who are pure in heart but is also near to those who draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>James 4:8a says, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is visible, yet we need to be pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, God is near to us, yet we need to draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His drawing near to us depends on our drawing near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From experience we know that whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we have the sense that God is near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He draws near to us that we may experience Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By drawing near to us God shows His love to us or His sympathy for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In drawing near to us He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes we may have the sense that God is near to us in order to wipe away our tears.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To those who draw near to God the Father He is near in order to love, sympathize, comfort, encourage, strengthen, and sustain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>5 Worshipped by Them by His Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God the Father is worshipped by the believers by His Spirit Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we worship God the Father in a religious way by rituals, we shall not be able to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But whenever we worship Him by the Spirit, we have the sense that we are touching Him and that we are brought out of ourselves and into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we worship God the Father by His Spirit, something of the living God, the One we worship by the Spirit, is wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is an experience and an enjoyment of God the Father that is unforgettable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We, the believers in Christ, experience and enjoy the very God whom we worship by His Spirit.</S>
