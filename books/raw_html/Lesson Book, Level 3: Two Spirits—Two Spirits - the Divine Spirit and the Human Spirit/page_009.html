<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SAVED BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br>OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>[In Philippians 1 Paul was saved from a particular situation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit. In chapter two he goes on to point out how the believers may experience a constant salvation in the ordinary things of daily life. For example, 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings." Murmurings and reasonings are things we experience daily. We may not experience hate or anger every day, but we certainly reason and murmur every day.]</P><P>You may often be unhappy with your situation at home or at school. You feel you are too restricted or overworked; you need more freedom or a change of pace. This kind of thinking, however, does not change things or make you happier. What you really need is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit! Paul was in prison expecting to die, yet he was rejoicing (Phil. 4:4). He said, "I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content" (Phil. 4:11). The next time that you feel your situation is a "prison," you need to declare, "Praise the Lord! Thank You for my wonderful situation! Dear Lord, You are all that I need!" This is not a theory; it is practical and experiential. This will save you from so many negative things and will surely cause you to express Christ to those around you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>The revelation in the Bible concerning the Spirit is progressive. In the Old Testament, the Spirit is merely the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah. It is not until the time of the Lord's incarnation in the New Testament that the title "Holy Spirit" is used. The "Spirit of God" existed from the very beginning, but "the Spirit" was "not yet" until the Lord passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death and resurrection. The Spirit today is the all-inclusive Spirit containing all the divine elements for our enjoyment!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the main titles used for the Spirit of God in the Old Testament? To what are they related?</li><li>When is the term "Holy Spirit" first used?</li><li>Why in John 7 was the Spirit "not yet?"</li><li>What are the elements of the Spirit of Jesus? The Spirit of Christ?</li><li>What is the consummate title of the divine Spirit? What is included in this simple title?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life-study of Philippians, p. 41.</li><li>The Basic Revelation in the Holy Scriptures, pp. 33-34.</li><li>The Completing Ministry of Paul, p. 50.</li><li>The Basic Revelation in the Holy Scriptures, p. 34.</li><li>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John, p. 380.</li><li>Life-study of Exodus, pp. 1727-1728, 1730.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, pp. 424-425.</li></ol>
