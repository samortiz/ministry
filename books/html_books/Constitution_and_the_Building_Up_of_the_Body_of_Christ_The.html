My burden can be expressed by the following four sentences:</P><P>1)The grain of wheat fell into the ground and died to bring forth many grains&#151;John 12:24.<br>2)Though we are many grains, we are one bread, one Body, the Body of Christ&#151;1 Cor. 10:17.<br>3)We are growing and being transformed into precious stones for God's building&#151;1 Cor. 3:6, 9, 12.<br>4)The New Jerusalem will be God's ultimate building, built with precious stones for God's eternal expression&#151;Rev. 21:9-21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST AND TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP</H2><P>A few words have been particularly selected for use in this book. The first is the word constitution. We use this word not to denote the constitution of some sort of organization; rather, we use it to denote something that is constituted with particular constituents. The church as the Body of Christ is not a formation or an organization but a constitution that has been constituted with the Christ of life as its very constituent. My burden is to help the saints see that the Body of Christ is a constitution, constituted with the Triune God embodied in Christ as the life element.</P><P>But the church has not only been constituted with Christ as its element; it is also being built up by the transformation in life. Therefore, we intend to cover two things in this book: (1) the constitution of the Body of Christ and (2) transformation for the building up of the Body of Christ. I would like you all to be impressed with these two words, constitution and transformation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST WITH THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST AS THE LIFE ELEMENT</H2><P>In this chapter we want to see the constitution of the Body of Christ with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element. These words may seem quite common in English, but the expression life element is not so common. What is the life element with which the church has been constituted? We must see that the church as the Body of Christ has been constituted not with a simple Christ but with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST, THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED<br>IN HUMANITY AS THE SOURCE OF LIFE,<br>SIGNIFIED BY THE TREE OF LIFE</H2><P>This all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). We all know God is invisible and very abstract and mysterious. It is difficult for anyone to tell us who God is, how God is, what God is, or where God is. Who can do this? I do not believe anyone can do this. But such a God, the Triune God, has been embodied in the flesh in a visible man (John 1:14). Christ is this man. Who then is Christ? Christ is the very Triune God embodied in a man of flesh.</P><P>This Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the source of life, and as the source of life, He is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 2:9; Rev. 2:7; 22:2). To read the Bible is not so easy. The Bible is not a simple book. It has many plain words, but it also has many figures of speech. One of these figures is the tree of life. Have you ever heard of such a tree? We have heard of peach trees, apple trees, and hundreds of other trees, but we may have never heard of a life tree. Yet in the Bible there is such a thing as the life tree, the tree of life.</P><P>Have you noticed that in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus told us that He is a tree (John 15:1, 5)? But He is not a pine tree, shooting into the sky so high that nobody can touch Him. He is a vine tree, not shooting up but spreading out. In a sense He is great and He is vast, yet He is also very low. He is not shooting into the air but spreading out on the earth. Even a little one can touch Him. He is great and He is spreading, yet He is low. This is what He told us in John 15.</P><P>Then elsewhere in the Gospel of John, the Lord told us that He is life (11:25; 14:6). He is a tree and He is life, and if you put these two together, you have a life tree, a tree of life. Christ is the life tree.</P><P>According to Genesis 2 the trees in the garden of Eden were good for food (v. 9). The tree of life was no exception to this; it also was good for food. We eat from all sorts of trees for the purpose of nourishing ourselves. But do you realize that we need another kind of tree? We need the life tree, which is God embodied in Christ. A picture or a figure is always better than a thousand words. In this figure Christ presents Himself to us as a tree, not a pine tree but a vine tree, spreading Himself before us. This indicates that we should eat Him. The first crucial figure in the Bible is the tree of life, signifying God Himself as life. We can call Him the life tree, and we can also call Him the God tree. The tree of life is the tree of God. We must realize that this tree of life is God Himself. Without this tree we would never know that our God is the life tree, the God tree.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. COMING</H2><P>What is the second crucial figure in the Bible? Perhaps you would say the tabernacle, or perhaps the temple. But according to the crucial view, the first figure in the Bible is the life tree, and the second one relates to Christ's coming. We do have such a Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God as the source of life signified by the life tree. But what follows the tree of life is Christ's coming.</P><P>Perhaps you may say, "But the coming of Christ is recorded in the first chapter of the New Testament, in Matthew 1, and the tree of life, the tree of God, is found in Genesis 2. What about the thirty-nine books in between?" Actually, the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament speak only of one person, Christ. This is why the Lord Jesus told His disciples that in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms He was mentioned (Luke 24:44). These are the three parts of the Old Testament. Each of the three sections speaks about Christ. Therefore, after the Bible tells us who Christ is by showing us the tree of life, it has thirty-nine books to present Christ to us. Christ is the subject of the Old Testament. Genesis 1 is about Christ. Genesis 2 is about Christ. Malachi 4 is also about Christ. Then after this presentation of Christ, Christ comes in Matthew 1. Hallelujah, Christ is here!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Through Incarnation to Become Flesh&#151;<br>a Man in "the Likeness of the Flesh"</H2><P>When I was young, I was taught that Jesus loves us and that He came down from heaven to earth. But I did not know how He came down to earth. Christ is God, and no one could approach Him. He is the invisible, mysterious God. Yet one day, four thousand years after He created the first man Adam, He came. After He created Adam, this Christ remained hidden for four thousand years. But during those four thousand years, He prophesied here and there, telling people that He would come. In Genesis 3:15 He told us He would come. In Isaiah 7:14 He said He would come through a virgin. In Isaiah 9:6 He said He would come as the Son and yet He would be called the Father. Then, four thousand years after He created Adam, He came.</P><P>The Bible tells us that Christ came through incarnation (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3b; 1 Tim. 3:16a). He came by entering into the womb of a virgin and by being begotten there (Matt. 1:18-20). The invisible God entered into a human virgin and was begotten there. Moreover, He stayed there in the womb for nine months. In this way, He as God was mingled with man. Then after being in the womb nine months, He was born. He was born, on the one hand, as God, and, on the other hand, as man. So He was a God-man with a human name, Jesus Christ. Yet people were to call Him Emmanuel, which means, God with us (Matt. 1:23). He is indeed a man, but He is also God. This was the greatest miracle in the whole universe, even more miraculous than the creation of the universe. God entered into man and stayed in a human womb for nine months, and then when He was born, He was both God and man. So in human history there was on this earth a particular One who is both God and man. There was no other one like Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Sower&#151;<br>the Distributor of the Divine Life</H2><P>We all know that Jesus Christ loves us and that He came to be our Savior. It is good that He is a Savior, but He is more than a Savior. He told us that He is the Sower (Matt. 13:3, 37). A sower sows the seed of life. Therefore, as the Sower the Lord Jesus is the Distributor of the divine life. He came that we might have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10b). But by what way did He come that we might have life? It was by His coming and sowing Himself into us. He is the Sower, the Distributor of the divine life, and because He has sown Himself into us, we all have this life. What is it to be saved? Some may say that to be saved is to be forgiven of our sins. This answer is correct, but it is not adequate. To be saved is not merely this. To be saved is to get Jesus into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Sow&#151;to Impart, to Dispense&#151;Himself</H2><P>The Sower distributes the divine life into us by sowing, imparting, and dispensing. He did not merely sow, but He also imparted the divine life, to make sure that He got into you. And He did not merely impart, but He also dispenses the divine life in a fine way bit by bit. Since the day you were saved, Christ has been dispensing the divine life bit by bit every day. He cannot dispense too much into you at one time; otherwise, you would "burst."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. As the Life Seed of Wheat, Signifying the Word</H2><P>Christ sows, imparts, and dispenses Himself as the life seed of wheat. This life seed of wheat signifies the word (Matt. 13:3, 19-23; Mark 4:14; John 6:68). One day the Lord Jesus saw Peter fishing, and He spoke something to him: "Come after Me" (Matt. 4:19). Then Peter came, and he was caught. From that day on Jesus could never get out of Peter. By His word He imparts Himself into us as a seed. A seed is precious and tiny. But after it has been sown into the earth for two or three months, something comes up. This is the seed's growing. So it is also with Christ: first, He came; then, He sowed Himself. He sowed Himself as the life seed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. INTO THE HUMAN HEART AS THE GROWING EARTH</H2><P>Christ is the seed, and He sowed Himself into our heart (Matt. 13:19b). The human heart is the growing earth. In farming, the seed is planted into the earth and is mingled with the element of the earth. The seed grows together with the earth. This produces the plant. This is very meaningful. Christ has sown Himself into us, and both He and we grow together. He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant. This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity. Today there is so much talk about what the Body of Christ is. But mostly this is doctrinal talk. The real Body, the Body of Christ in reality, is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed sown into the human heart as the growing earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. TO GROW CHRIST IN THE GOOD EARTH<br>OF THE HUMAN HEART FOR HIS MULTIPLICATION<br>TO BE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH<br>TO FULFILL GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY</H2><P>Christ has sown Himself into our heart as the growing earth to grow Christ. When I was young, I was taught that I must learn the Bible doctrines and teachings, but no one ever told me that I must grow Christ. I would like to impress you all with this and encourage you to remember just one thing: Now that Christ is in you, you must grow Christ. What do you do every day? Growing Christ must be your main job.</P><P>Christ grows in the good earth (Matt. 13:8, 23). What is the good earth? The good earth is a good heart that is pure, simple to God, and also absolute for Him. It is in this good heart as the good earth that Christ grows. If on the one hand you love Christ and, on the other hand, you love many things besides Him, your heart is not single, pure, and absolute. Such a heart is not a good heart, and such a heart cannot grow Christ. Perhaps you have stones in your heart, or thorns and thistles. All these things compete with Christ. They are in rivalry with Christ. Such a heart cannot grow Christ. All of us need to purify our heart, simplify our heart, and deal with our heart so that it would be absolute toward Him. Then our heart will be the good earth for growing Christ.</P><P>This growing of Christ is for Christ's multiplication. The Lord Jesus told us that He was the one grain of wheat (John 12:24). If He had not fallen into the earth to die, He would have remained one grain. But He fell into the earth and died, and He brought forth many grains. These many grains are His multiplication. Two thousand years ago there was only one Jesus in Palestine, but today on this earth there are millions of "Jesuses." Jesus has been multiplied.</P><P>His multiplication is for the constitution of the church in order to fulfill God's eternal economy. God has a big project, which is called His eternal economy (Eph. 3:8-10). His eternal economy is just to sow Christ into many human beings through you and me. So today we all have to be sowers. Through us more grains will come out. This is the multiplication for the constitution of the Body of Christ, which is the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CHRIST AND THE BELIEVERS BECOMING ONE<br>TO PRODUCE THE ORGANIC ELEMENT<br>FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Christ as the divine life seed and the believers as the human growing earth become one to produce the organic element for the constitution of the church (Eph. 1:22). The church is not merely a group of Christians added together to form an organization. It is not some religious entity within society. The church is Christ living in you, living in me, and living in the millions of other Christians. This living Body, this living entity, is the Body of Christ, which is the church. Hence, the church is a constitution, having Christ as its constituent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. MAKING THE CHURCH THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>WITH THE SPIRIT, THE LORD, AND<br>GOD THE FATHER AS ITS CONTENTS</H2><P>By sowing Himself into the believers, Christ makes the church the Body of Christ with the Spirit as the essence of the Body, the Lord as the element of the Body, and God the Father as the source of the Body&#151;the Triune God&#151;as its contents (Eph. 1:23; 4:4-6). Christ today as the divine life seed is the Spirit, the Lord, and also God the Father. The Divine Trinity today is within us as our contents. My burden is to show you that the church is not anything outward. The church is certainly not a building. But neither is the church merely a group of Christians coming together. Actually the reality of the church is Christ living in us as the Spirit, as the Lord, and as God the Father. Christ Himself is the contents of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING THE CHURCH AS<br>HIS BODY AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE NEW MAN</H2><P>Because Christ Himself is the contents of the church, Christ becomes the Body (1 Cor. 12:12). What is the church? The church is Christ multiplied, enlarged. Therefore, Christ Himself is the church. Furthermore, the church as the Body of Christ is the new man, and Christ is every member of the new man (Col. 3:10-11). Christ is the Body, and Christ is every member of the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. TO BE THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED<br>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD AS<br>HIS FULLNESS, HIS CORPORATE EXPRESSION</H2><P>Since Christ is both the Body and every member of the new man, the church is actually the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. We human beings have bodies, living and organic bodies, which are organisms to express us. If I did not have a body, I would have to stand here as a ghost. My speaking then would scare you away. But I have a very good organism to express me, which is my body. When you see my body, you say, "Oh, that's Brother Lee." This is what an organism does. In the same way, the church is an organism of the Triune God that manifests and expresses Him as His fullness, His corporate expression (Eph. 3:19-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. CONSUMMATING IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>This organism consummates in the New Jerusalem, firstly, in the millennial kingdom in a small scale (Rev. 2:7; 3:12), then lastly, in the new heaven and new earth in the full scale (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-21; 22:1-2). Actually, this organism is what the entire Bible is about. The divine revelation of the Bible begins with God (Gen. 1:1) and consummates in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). The first item in the Bible is God, and the last item is the New Jerusalem. In between is Christ and the church. The Bible teaches us about God, whose consummation is in the New Jerusalem through Christ and the church. This is the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIFE OF LIVING CHRIST FOR THE CONSTITUTION OF HIS BODY</H2><P>According to the items covered above, we can see that we Christians, as members of the Body of Christ, are very particular persons. However, many Christians do not walk up to the standard of God according to what the Bible says about the believers. To most of the Christians, the Christian life is a matter of learning the Bible and improving their character and conduct to please God, to glorify Him, to save sinners through their preaching of the gospel of God, etc. But I must tell you, this is not up to the standard of God's intention in His eternal redemption and complete salvation. A Christian should be one who mainly lives Christ (Phil. 1:20-21) for the constitution of the Body of Christ, which is enlarged and constituted with all His real believers, with Christ as their life element (Rom. 12:5).</P><P>The divine revelation of the entire Bible unveils to us that God in His eternal economy wants to have an organic Body for Christ. It was for this purpose that He created man in His own image and after His own likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). It was for this purpose that He intended to be man's life (Gen. 2:9). It was for this purpose that He became incarnated to be a man and to join Himself with man as one. It was for this purpose that He accomplished His eternal redemption through crucifixion and carried out His complete salvation through resurrection. It was for this purpose that He poured Himself out as the all-inclusive and consummated Spirit for the constitution of the church as the Body of Christ. It was for this purpose that He has chosen, predestinated, called, redeemed, saved, and regenerated us with Himself as our life in Christ, that we may be the organic members of the Body of Christ. It was also for this purpose that He is sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ. By all this we can have a clear view to see that God's intention in His eternal economy is to have us grow Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ, that we may be mature in Christ to have His full stature and to be built up through transformation in the full measure of His fullness (Eph. 4:11-16).</P><P>Paul the apostle, when he was Saul, was mistaken to keep the law of God as the main goal of his life. After he was saved and regenerated, the main goal of his life was corrected from keeping the law to living Christ. He saw that he was crucified with Christ and it was no longer he who lived but Christ who lived in him (Gal. 2:20). So, he endeavored to live Christ that Christ might be magnified in him (Phil. 1:20-21) for the building up of the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24) and the fulfillment of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-10).</P><P>Being a Christian depends mainly on living Christ for the constitution and building up of the Body of Christ. This is the reality of the Lord's recovery in this age. Without Christ as the life element for the constitution of the Body of Christ, and without the Body of Christ as the full expression of the all-inclusive Christ, the recovery today would become zero. Do not consider the church merely according to outward teachings and practices, concerning the matters of the local churches, the universal church, local autonomy, or of this or that. The church in its reality is not in this realm. The church is altogether a matter of Christ whom we live and magnify. If you live yourself, you are neither the universal church nor a local church. But if we live Christ, He is everything&#151;the universal church and the local church. Why are there divisions today? Simply because people talk about doctrines and practices concerning the church, but neglect the living of Christ. If they do live Christ, no division would come into being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEVEN FIGURES IN THE HISTORY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>This is the history of the Triune God. Firstly, the Bible shows us that the Triune God was signified by the tree of life. Then He came in incarnation to be the one grain in the flesh, who died and resurrected to produce the many grains. Through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection God became the many grains which are we. As the many grains we are ground into flour to make one bread, and this bread is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the new man as the organism of the Triune God, which eventually consummates in the New Jerusalem. In the history of the Triune God there are these seven figures: the tree of life, the grain of wheat, the many grains, the one bread, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the New Jerusalem. Remember these seven figures, for they are the very extract of the entire Bible.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S FRUSTRATION,<br>DAMAGE, AND CORRUPTION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:4-7, 19-22, 24-33, 36-43</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Under the enemy Satan's frustration:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the human heart as the wayside hardened by worldly traffic and with the evil spirits of Satan as the birds snatching away the word of life&#151;Matt. 13:4, 19.</li>	<li>By the shallow heart which has hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity as rocks hindering the life seed from taking root in the depths of the heart and is stumbled by affliction and persecution&#151;Matt. 13:5-6, 20-21.</li>	<li>By the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches as the thorns choking the life seed in growth to make it unfruitful&#151;Matt. 13:7, 22.</li>	</ol><li>Under the enemy Satan's damage:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By sowing tares (signifying the sons of the evil one) in the midst of the wheat (signifying the sons of the kingdom) to restrict and damage the growth and development of the wheat&#151;Matt. 13:25-30, 38-42.</li>	<li>By changing the nature of the small mustard, signifying the church in life, which is good for food supply, into the nature of a tree, signifying the big Christendom in confusion, which is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds"&#151;Matt. 13:31-32.</li>	</ol>	<P>Note: The three items above in I. frustrate the growth of the life seed in the believers and restrict the multiplication of Christ through His believers; whereas the two items in II., on the one hand, bring in a mixture among the components of the church and, on the other hand, change the nature of the church and make the appearance of the church abnormal.</P><li>Under the enemy Satan's corruption:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By leavening the initial church, typified by the two wave-loaves offered to God on the day of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-17), and confirmed by the sinful case of Ananias and Sapphira in deceiving God the Spirit (Acts 5:1-11) and the case of murmuring concerning the overlooking of the daily dispensing to the widows (Acts 6:1).</li>	<li>By leavening the church in Corinth with the gross sin of fornication (1 Cor. 5:1-8).</li>	<li>By leavening the church with different teachings other than the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:3-4).</li>	<li>By leavening the entire meal (fine flour made of the grains of wheat) through a woman (the Catholic Church as the false prophetess Jezebel&#151;Rev. 2:20)&#151;Matt. 13:33.</li>	<li>By leavening the early church with Judaism (in Sabbath keeping&#151;Col. 2:16; circumcision practice&#151;Acts 15:1-2; Gal. 6:15; the so-called holy diet&#151;Acts 11:2-3; Gal. 2:12-13; and traditions&#151;Gal. 1:14), Gnosticism (Col. 2:8), and asceticism (Col. 2:20-23).</li>	<li>By leavening the church with Catholicism in the papal system, hierarchy, heresies, idolatry, and pagan practices.</li>	<li>By leavening the church with Protestantism in hierarchy, being living in name and dead in actuality, different teachings, traditions, modernism, worldliness, and divisions.</li>	<li>By leavening the church with nationalism, racialism, socialism, liberalism, politics, etc.</li>	<li>By leavening the church with the believers' natural man, flesh and its lust, sin in their nature and sins in their deeds, and all the evil things listed in Gal. 5:19-21.</li>	</ol><P>Note: The enemy Satan's leavening of the church is to corrupt the church in its nature and contents. Even the life element (the entire meal made of the grains produced by the wheat), of which the church is constituted, is leavened. This disease of the church is in its constituents. Such a disease of being corrupted by being leavened is incurable.</P></ol><P>In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ with the all-inclusive Christ as the life-element. Matthew 13 shows us how Christ came as the Sower to sow Himself as the life seed of wheat, signifying the word, into the human heart as the growing earth (vv. 3, 19b). The growing of Christ in the good earth of the human heart is for His multiplication to be the constitution of the church to fulfill God's eternal economy (Matt. 13:8, 23; John 12:24; Eph. 3:8-10).</P><P>In Matthew 13 we have such a picture of positive things, but we also have a picture of negative things. Matthew 13 also reveals the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption. Satan works to undermine the Lord's work in three ways&#151;first to frustrate, then to damage, and finally to corrupt. I hope we have the spiritual capacity to see this vision of Satan's schemes. We need a vision, not just a doctrine or a teaching. We need to see a heavenly "movie," a heavenly vision, which deeply impresses us with the enemy's three kinds of works: his frustration, damage, and corruption. In chapter thirteen of Matthew, the Lord Jesus not only opened up the heavenly things but also opened up the hellish things.</P><P>Before we begin to fellowship about the enemy's work seen in Matthew 13, I would like to say a further word about the Lord's coming. Christians commonly believe that Jesus came the first time and that He will come a second time. But we also need to realize that His coming has not been fully consummated. It is still going on. On the one hand, Jesus has come, but on the other hand, Jesus has not finished His coming. For Jesus to come down from heaven to earth and be conceived in the womb of a virgin through incarnation was an instant thing, but for Him to come into you and me took a long time.</P><P>Christ's coming has three great, main steps&#151;incarnation, death, and resurrection. The first step was incarnation. Jesus as the only, unique God lived in eternity before time. Then He created the universe and man. Four thousand years after the creation of man, He stepped out of eternity and into time. When He came out of eternity and stepped into time, He stepped into humanity. In eternity past He was God, but in His incarnation He stepped out of eternity into time and with His divinity into humanity.</P><P>It is a wonder that the almighty, infinite God entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months! Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Jesus was begotten of the Holy Spirit. God was born into the womb of Mary. Then after nine months, He was born out of Mary to be both man and God, a God-man.</P><P>How do we know that God stepped out of eternity and into time and with His divinity entered into humanity? We know this because the Bible tells us so (John 1:1, 14). Jesus is a God-man. In the whole universe there is a person who is both God, with His divinity, and man, with His humanity. He is not only after God's kind but also after man's kind. According to history the most unique person is Jesus Christ. He has both divinity and humanity.</P><P>Christ came in incarnation, but it took Him a much longer time of passing through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection to come into us. We know that Jesus now lives in us not only because the Bible tells us so (Gal. 2:20a; 2 Cor. 13:5) but also because our experience testifies that it is so. My experience told me that Jesus lived in me. It was the same with all of us who have received Him. His coming to live in us changed us from naughty ones to "Jesus gentlemen" and "Jesus ladies." This extra One has made us different from the people of the world. Today we are the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9). Jesus lives in us. We know this because of what the Bible says and because of our experience.</P><P>The incarnated Jesus came into us by passing through a long process. Following His incarnation Jesus lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross to die. His death was the second major step He took in order to come into us. By being crucified He took care of all the negative things and He solved all the problems. He took away our sin and our sins. His death solved everything and terminated everything of the old creation.</P><P>He died on the cross, was buried, and on the third day He resurrected. His resurrection was the third major step of His coming. First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in His resurrection He became another person, the life-giving Spirit. In His incarnation He, as God, became a man. In His resurrection He, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. Therefore, Christ is God, Christ is man, and Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Today the very Christ who has come into us and who is still living in us is God, man, and the Spirit.</P><P>The Bible reveals emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. Today the Lord Jesus is the omnipresent One in resurrection. He is in heaven, He is on earth, He is in you, He is in me, and He is in millions of His believers. From the day that we called on the Lord and received Him, we realized that someone came into us and was even added into us. Jesus can enter into us because He has become the life-giving Spirit. Today He has finished His three major steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. He became a man and in man He died, solving all the problems and taking away all the troubles in the universe. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit so that He could enter into us. Today He is in us.</P><P>Christ is still coming today because He is still in the process of entering into millions of people. But even in such a so-called Christian nation as the United States, millions of people have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus. The Lord desires all men to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). We have to go with the Lord to them to bring the Lord to them. He is still in the process of His coming until He eventually will come from the heavens to the air and from the air to the earth. That will be the ultimate step in the consummation of His coming.</P><P>Today we have such a wonderful Lord Jesus within us. This is all bright, all in the day, and all positive, but with the day there is also the night. We need to see the night, the negative picture, presented to us in Matthew 13. Matthew 13 reveals the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S FRUSTRATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By the Human Heart as the Wayside<br>Hardened by the Worldly Traffic and with<br>the Evil Spirits of Satan as the Birds<br>Snatching Away the Word of Life</H2><P>Matthew 13 tells us that the Lord went out as the Sower to sow the seed into the hearts of many people. The Lord revealed that the human heart is of four categories. Three are negative and one is positive.</P><P>The first kind of heart is likened to a place beside the way (v. 4). Beside the farming field is a way, and the place beside this way becomes hard because of too much traffic. Because it is close to the way, it is easily hardened by the traffic of the way. When the seed falls on the hard wayside, there is no way for the seed to get into the soil. This affords a good chance for the birds from the air to snatch all the seeds away.</P><P>Jesus is sowing the seed, but your heart may be too hard. The seed cannot penetrate into your heart. It remains on the surface of your heart, and then the birds, signifying the evil spirits, come to snatch away the word. In this whole universe there is not only the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, but also the evil spirits. They are crouching, watching, and waiting to snatch away the word sown in the hardened heart. We can see Satan's frustrating work with the human heart as the wayside hardened by worldly traffic and with the evil spirits of Satan as the birds snatching away the word of life (Matt. 13:4, 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Shallow Heart Which Has Hidden Sins, Personal Desires, Self-seeking, and Self-pity<br>as Rocks Hindering the Life Seed from<br>Taking Root in the Depths of the Heart and<br>Is Stumbled by Affliction and Persecution</H2><P>On the surface your heart may be soft, but it may not be deep. Instead, it may be shallow. Matthew 13 shows us the shallow heart which has hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity as rocks hindering the life seed from taking root in the depths of the heart and is stumbled by affliction and persecution (vv. 5-6, 20-21). All these negative things are typified by hard rocks underneath the surface of the field, making the earth shallow. These rocks within us hinder the life seed from taking root in our heart. Those with such a heart are stumbled when affliction or persecution comes. We have seen many like this. First, they heard and received the gospel joyfully, but after a time persecution and affliction stumbled them because there was no root penetrating into their being that could cause the life seed to live long in them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By the Anxiety of the Age and the Deceitfulness of Riches as the Thorns Choking the Life Seed<br>in Growth to Make It Unfruitful</H2><P>We have believed in the Lord Jesus, receiving Him as our Savior, but day by day we have to deal with the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches. Money is a big lie, deceiving everybody. The anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches are like thorns to choke the life seed in us in growth and to make our heart unfruitful (Matt. 13:7, 22). Many believers are like this. They believe in the Lord Jesus. They call on Him and even pray to Him. Yet some thorns as the anxiety of life and the deceitfulness of money choke the life seed in them.</P><P>The above three kinds of hearts are under the enemy's frustrating work, but there is a fourth kind of heart. The fourth kind is the good heart, typified by the good earth. A good heart is a heart that is pure, single, and absolute toward God. It is a heart that does not care for the anxiety of the age or for money. A person with such a heart is pure, single, and absolute only for God. There is no choking of the life seed, no frustration, and no hindrance within him, so the life seed of Christ can grow in him to bear fruit, making him fruitful in Christ.</P><P>Man's heart was created by God, but Satan came in to make man's heart either like the wayside, like the shallow earth, or like the earth full of thorns choking the life seed. Satan works so that man's heart would not be available for God's purpose. All the different kinds of hearts in the negative sense are the results of Satan's frustrating work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S DAMAGE</H2><P>Satan, God's enemy, not only frustrates the constitution of the Body of Christ but also works to damage it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Sowing Tares</H2><P>Satan works to damage by sowing tares (signifying the sons of the evil one) in the midst of the wheat (signifying the sons of the kingdom) to restrict and damage the growth and development of the wheat (Matt. 13:25-30, 38-42). Tares are false wheat. At the initial stage of their growth, they look exactly like wheat. It is impossible to distinguish wheat from tares until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black. Today in Christianity, among so many real Christians, there are also some false Christians, Christians in name. At the beginning they look the same as Christians until they bring forth fruit. Then by their fruit people can discern that they are false Christians.</P><P>While the Lord Jesus is sowing Himself as the life seed, Satan is also sowing the tares. The farmers are not able to tell where the tares come from, but after the wheat has grown up, some tares are mysteriously among them. This typifies the devilish damage of God's enemy. Among millions of Christians there are thousands of tares, false ones. In the first part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church.</P><P>First, we see the evil spirits as the birds coming to snatch away the word of life. Then Satan has another way. This way is his adding in some false ones to damage the growth of the real wheat. The false Christians among the real Christians always restrict and damage the growth and development of the wheat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Changing the Nature of the Small Mustard into the Nature of a Tree</H2><P>Satan's damage is also to change the nature of the small mustard, signifying the church in life, which is good for food supply, into the nature of a tree, signifying the big Christendom in confusion, which is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds" (Matt. 13:31-32). The mustard plant is small, but Satan changed the nature of the mustard into a great tree. The mustard signifies the church in life, which is good for food supply, but today's Christendom is a big organization, like a big tree. Instead of being good for food, it is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds."</P><P>The church should be small in nature and in function, not big as Christendom is. We Christians who follow the Lord Jesus are relatively small in number, but Satan has made Christendom very large. This is a damage to the church. This is why in the recovery we do not like to have anything as a big facade.</P><P>We need to note that the three items above under Roman numeral I (the wayside, the rocks, and the thorns) frustrate the growth of the life seed in the believers and restrict the multiplication of Christ through His believers; whereas the two items above under Roman numeral II (the tares and the mustard seed becoming a great tree), on the one hand, bring in a mixture among the components of the church, and on the other hand, change the nature of the church and make the appearance of the church abnormal.</P><P>Today the appearance of Christianity is altogether abnormal. In the church life, we do not have titles or assigned pastors as great speakers. The genuine church is not something great but is like the small mustard that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man. For the proper church life, we need to have the fourth kind of heart, the good earth, for growing Christ, and we need to be small, not great. The Lord Jesus told His disciples that they were a little flock (Luke 12:32). We should be the little flock following the Lord (1 Pet. 5:2a; Acts 20:28). If we are not, we are abnormal. The church is little in number compared with the world. The church as the little flock is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for the birds to lodge in, not a huge religion like Christendom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S CORRUPTION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Leavening the Initial Church</H2><P>Satan's corruption of the church began with his leavening the initial church, typified by the two wave-loaves offered to God on the day of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-17). Leviticus 23 says that on the day of Pentecost, God requested His people to offer two leavened loaves, not unleavened loaves. That indicates that from the first day the church was established, the church was already impure. This was confirmed by the sinful case of Ananias and Sapphira in deceiving God the Spirit (Acts 5:1-11) and the case of the murmuring concerning the overlooking of the daily dispensing to the widows (Acts 6:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Leavening the Church in Corinth</H2><P>Satan also corrupted the church by leavening the church in Corinth with the gross sin of fornication (1 Cor. 5:1-8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By Leavening the Church with Different Teachings Other Than the Economy of God</H2><P>Satan's corrupting work is also by leavening the church with different teachings other than the teaching of the economy of God. Paul exhorted Timothy to remain at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:3-4). This tells us that even in the early days among the churches different teachings were being taught. Different teachings create divisions. Because there are hundreds of different teachings today, there are also hundreds of different groups, different divisions. This is a kind of leavening to divide the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. By Leavening the Entire Meal<br>through a Woman</H2><P>Satan's corruption is portrayed in Matthew 13:33, which speaks of the leavening of the entire meal (fine flour made of the grains of wheat) through a woman (the Catholic Church as the false prophetess Jezebel&#151;Rev. 2:20). This means that the Catholic Church itself is a false prophetess.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. By Leavening the Early Church<br>with Judaism, Gnosticism, and Asceticism</H2><P>Satan worked to leaven the early church with Judaism in Sabbath keeping (Col. 2:16); in circumcision practice (Acts 15:1-2; Gal. 6:15); in the so-called holy diet (Acts 11:2-3; Gal. 2:12-13); and in traditions (Gal. 1:14). He also leavened the early church with Gnosticism (Col. 2:8) and asceticism (Col. 2:20-23). These "isms" were leaven by which the church was corrupted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. By Leavening the Church with Catholicism</H2><P>Satan also leavened the church with Catholicism in the papal system, hierarchy, heresies, idolatry, and pagan practices. The Catholic Church was fully formed in the sixth century when the papal system was established. There is also an established hierarchy in Catholicism with the pope as the head under whom are the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests. Catholicism is full of heretical teachings, idolatry, and pagan practices. They call Mary the mother of God and say that she has no sin. To worship Mary as the holy mother is heresy as well as idolatry. Catholicism also invented the holidays of Christmas and Easter, which are pagan in their origin and full of pagan practices. Christmas originated from European paganism. The name of Christ was attached to the birthday of the sun god celebrated on December 25. In principle the celebration of Easter is the same. The Catholic cathedrals are full of idols, statues and pictures, to which people pray. There is one Catholic cathedral in Manila with a statue of Jesus, and all the worshippers entering into the cathedral touch the feet of this statue. This shows the heresy and superstition of the Roman Catholic Church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. By Leavening the Church with Protestantism</H2><P>Satan also leavened the church with Protestantism in its hierarchy. The Protestant church has its ministers and pastors in a kind of religious organization with a hierarchy. Revelation 3:1 also reveals that the Protestant church is living in name but dead in actuality.</P><P>Protestantism is full of different teachings. The denomnations are based upon their different teachings. The Southern Baptists stress baptism by immersion. Based upon that teaching, they set up a denomination to baptize people by immersion. The Presbyterians stress the presbytery, the ruling and managing of a so-called local church by a body of elders. Based upon that teaching, they formed the Presbyterian church. All of the different denominations are founded upon their different teachings, and they have their traditions which they must keep.</P><P>Furthermore, today in the Protestant church there are some modernists, teaching people that the Bible is not inspired by God, that there are no miracles, that there are no angels, and that there is no Spirit. The modernists do not believe that Jesus is God or that He died to redeem us from our sins. They do not believe in the resurrection of Christ. Instead, they say that Christ sacrificed Himself merely as a martyr. Protestantism is also full of worldliness and divisions. This is why we cannot remain there. We do not want to be under that kind of leavening.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. By Leavening the Church with Nationalism, Racialism, Socialism, Liberalism, Politics, Etc.</H2><P>The church has also been leavened with nationalism and racialism. Today in this country there are still so-called black churches and white churches. The whites and the blacks do not meet together. Socialism with class distinctions is also prevalent in Christianity. Liberalism and politics are other forms of leaven in Christendom. This is Satan's corruption, so in the recovery we cannot allow anything like this to exist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. By Leavening the Church with the Believers' Natural Man, Flesh and Its Lust, Sin in<br>Their Nature and Sins in Their Deeds, and<br>all the Evil Things Listed in Galatians 5:19-21</H2><P>Satan's corruption is also seen in his leavening the church with the believers' natural man and their flesh and its lust. This leaven is also the sin in their nature, the sins in their deeds, and all the evil things listed in Galatians 5:19-21. One of the evil things listed in Galatians is sects, or schools of opinion (see v. 20 and note 4&#151;Recovery Version). Even in a little church of eleven or twelve meeting together, there can be a number of opinions as a leavening factor of corruption.</P><P>The enemy Satan's leavening of the church is to corrupt the church in its nature and contents. Even the life element (the entire meal made of the grains produced by the wheat), of which the church is constituted, is leavened. This disease of the church is in its constituents. Such a disease of being corrupted by being leavened is incurable.</P><P>This chapter shows us the schemes of God's enemy, Satan, with his frustration, damage, and corruption. We see his frustrating work in the human heart, his damaging work in adding false believers and in changing the church's nature, and his corrupting work in leavening the whole content of Christianity. We must give up all these negative things so that we may be pure and be freed from all kinds of frustrations, all kinds of damage, and all kinds of corruption to grow Christ that Christ may be multiplied among us and through us to enter into many others that they might be regenerated.</P><P>I hope that all the saints in the recovery could see clearly that we need to be freed from all the frustrations of Satan, from all the damage of the enemy, and from all the corruption of the devil. May the Lord be merciful to us. We are different from others not because we like to be different but because we like to be purified and freed that we may grow Christ for His multiplication and for His constitution and building up of the Body of Christ by the transformation in life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 29; 3:14, 5; 1:32, 12-13; 6:57b-58a; 7:37-39; 20:22; Rev. 2:7b, 17b; 22:2</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Its source:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The eternal Word&#151;God in eternity&#151;John 1:1-2; 1 John 1:1.</li>		<li>In whom is life&#151;John 1:4a; 1 John 1:2.</li>		</ol>	<li>Its base:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God&#151;John 1:29.</li>		<li>The termination by the crucifixion of Christ in the likeness of the serpent&#151;John 3:14.</li>		<li>The regeneration of the Spirit as the dove&#151;John 3:5; 1:32:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To produce the children of God with the right of the divine life&#151;John 1:12.</li>			<li>Born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man&#151;John 1:13.</li>			</ol>		<li>The eternal life of God, the uncreated life, the indestructible life&#151;John 3:15; 1 John 1:2.</li>		<li>God dwelling in us&#151;1 John 3:24; 4:13.</li>		<li>The seed of God abiding in us&#151;1 John 3:9.</li>		<li>The destruction of the works of the devil and the casting out of him as the ruler of the world&#151;1 John 3:8; John 12:31b.</li>		<li>The judgment on the world&#151;John 12:31a.</li>		</ol>	<li>Its way:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By eating Christ:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>As the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life&#151;John 6:57b-58a, 51, 68.</li>			<li>As the tree of life&#151;Rev. 2:7b; 22:2.</li>			<li>As the hidden manna&#151;Rev. 2:17b.</li>			</ol>		<li>By drinking Christ:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>As the life-giving Spirit&#151;John 7:37-39.</li>			<li>As the water of life&#151;John 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6b; 22:17b.</li>			<li>By breathing Christ as the spiritual breath&#151;John 20:22.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Its progression:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the young children:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Who know the Father&#151;1 John 2:13c.</li>			<li>Who have received the anointing to know all things&#151;1 John 2:18-27.</li>			</ol>		<li>Growing into the young men:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Who are strong in the word of God&#151;1 John 2:14b.</li>			<li>Who have overcome the evil one&#151;1 John 2:13b, 14c.</li>			<li>Who do not love the world nor the things in the world&#151;1 John 2:15-17.</li>			</ol>		<li>As the young men growing into the fathers, who know Him&#151;Christ, who is from the beginning&#151;1 John 2:13a, 14a.</li>		</ol>	<li>For the transformation into white stones:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Justified and approved by the Lord&#151;Rev. 2:17b.</li>		<li>For the building of God, signified by the pillars as parts of the building of God&#151;the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 3:12:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Firstly in the millennium in the initial stage&#151;Rev. 2:7; 3:12.</li>			<li>Lastly in the new heaven and new earth in its ultimate consummation&#151;Rev. 21:1-3.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Growth in the divine life for transformation being vital for the building up of the Body of Christ today.</li>	</ol></ol><P>In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption as revealed in Matthew 13. We need to be impressed with all these negative things.</P><P>Satan's frustrating work is seen within the human heart (vv. 1-23). The first kind of heart is as the wayside, hardened by the heavy traffic of the world. The word of life cannot penetrate the hardened heart, giving the evil spirits the opportunity to snatch the word of life away. There is a war raging between God and His enemy, Satan. God has myriads of angels, but a number of His angels followed Satan in his rebellion (see Rev. 12:4 and note 1). Thus, Satan has his evil angels, the evil spirits. The Lord Jesus in Matthew 13 likened these evil spirits to the birds snatching away the seed sown on the hardened earth. The second kind of heart is the shallow heart which is like the shallow earth with hidden rocks. These rocks are items such as hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity. The third kind of heart is likened to the earth with thorns which choke the life seed. These thorns are the anxiety of this age, this life, and the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>Matthew 13 also reveals the enemy Satan's damage with his sowing tares in the midst of the wheat and his changing the nature of the mustard seed into a big tree (vv. 24-32). The tares are the false believers, the sons of the evil one, and the big tree is big Christendom in confusion.</P><P>Finally, Satan works to corrupt the church by leavening it (vv. 33-35). The leaven is the greatest negative thing. All the different aspects of leaven which we pointed out in the previous chapter have been greatly used by God's enemy, Satan, throughout the past twenty centuries. This is why today's Christianity has nearly lost its impact. Half of the United States population is supposed to be Christian, but where is the Christian influence today? There is hardly any influence. Everywhere there is darkness, with very little light. Everywhere there is corruption, and many believers have lost their function as the salt of the earth (Matt. 5:13). Leaven can be seen throughout today's Christianity in every aspect. According to the parable in Matthew 13 the entire life element in Christianity has been fully leavened. To be full of leaven is to be fully corrupted.</P><P>We need to remember all these negative things, from the heart like the wayside to the corrupting leaven. If we remember these negative things, our eyes will be opened. We will see a vision like a heavenly video before our eyes. Then we will know what today's age really is. It is truly a terrible age. Where is the church that is full of impact, influence, and power from the heavens? There is not such a thing.</P><P>In these dark days of degradation, we have to cooperate with the Lord for the carrying out of His recovery. This is why we need to see a vision on both the positive and negative sides. On the positive side, the Triune God became incarnated to be a wonderful person. That person is the God-man, Christ&#151;the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, signified by the tree of life. He went to the cross to die an all-inclusive, vicarious death. Then He entered into resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit. In resurrection as the one grain who died, He has become the many grains. We are the many grains who have been made into one bread, and this one bread is the one Body, the one church, the one new man, the organism of the Triune God. Eventually, this organism becomes the New Jerusalem. How wonderful this is! But regretfully there is also a negative picture, a picture in the night, a picture from the heart as the wayside to the corrupting leaven. We need to come out of this negative picture and be in the positive one with Christ as the Triune God embodied in humanity to be the tree of life, the one grain, the many grains, the one bread, the Body of Christ, the new man, the organism of the Triune God, and the New Jerusalem. We need to be in the recovery, cooperating with the Lord to recover all the items of this positive picture. We also need to be impressed with the vision of the negative picture of Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption.</P><P>Now that we have seen the positive and negative pictures revealed in Matthew 13, we come to the third picture, which is revealed mainly in the Gospel of John. In the Gospel of John, we can see the building up of the Body of Christ by the growth in life. This life is the divine life, the life of the Triune God. Through incarnation this divine life has been mingled with humanity, and this life with Christ's humanity has gone through a wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive, vicarious death. Then this life with His humanity has entered into resurrection and is now in resurrection. Such a life is a life of divinity, a life of humanity, a life of incarnation, a life through crucifixion, a life in resurrection, and also a life in ascension.</P><P>By the growth of this life, the church is built up. The building up of the church will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The building up of the Body of Christ altogether depends upon our growth in this wonderful life, a life that is compounded with the divine life as the base, and with Christ's humanity, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, and the power of His resurrection as its ingredients. We have such a life, but we must look to the Lord for His mercy that we would be willing to let this life grow in us. By the growth of such a life, the church as the Body of Christ is being built up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE<br>UNVEILED IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN</H2><P>Now we want to see the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John. In the entire New Testament, the writings of John speak about life the most. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic Gospels. They do not speak about life as much as John does. In Matthew 7 the Lord Jesus said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it (v. 14). But in John the Lord said that if we come to Him and drink, rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being (7:37-38). He also said that if we drink of Him, we will never thirst again (4:14), and that if we eat of Him, we will never be hungry again (6:35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Its Source</H2><P>The believers' growth in life has a source, and the source is the eternal Word&#151;God in eternity (John 1:1-2; 1 John 1:1) in whom is life (John 1:4a; 1 John 1:2). Singing to the Lord can help us to grow in life by contacting God as the source of life. If we would sing a hymn such as #1151 in Hymns three times every morning for one week, we would be different persons. Instead of being dead and dying, we would be those who are living and growing in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Its Base</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God</H2><P>The base of the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John is first the redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God. John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Termination by the Crucifixion of Christ<br>in the Likeness of the Serpent</H2><P>The base of our growth in life is also the termination by the crucifixion of Christ in the likeness of the serpent (John 3:14). Christ in typology is a lamb, but have we ever realized that Christ in type is also a brass serpent? Just as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so Christ as the Son of Man was lifted up on the cross. He died as the Lamb of God because of our sin. He was lifted up on the cross in the form of a serpent because we became serpentine in our old nature. We were bitten by the old serpent, Satan.</P><P>In Genesis 3 the old serpent came to poison our first mother and first father, so we also got poisoned. Actually, we were poisoned nearly six thousand years ago when the first couple was poisoned by the old serpent. As a result, we became serpents (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33). We are serpentine. This is why Christ died in the likeness of the serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), to deal with and terminate the old serpent, Satan, the devil, and the serpentine nature within our old fallen man. This is seen in the type of the brass serpent lifted up in the wilderness by Moses in Numbers 21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Regeneration of the Spirit as the Dove</H2><P>The third aspect of the base of the believers' growth in life is the regeneration of the Spirit as the dove (John 3:5; 1:32) to produce the children of God with the right of the divine life (1:12), who are born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man (v. 13).</P><P>Christ is revealed in the first three chapters of John as a lamb, a serpent, and a dove. The Lamb is to deal with our sins, the serpent is to deal with our serpentine nature, and the dove is to impart life into us, to enliven us, to regenerate us. Through the Lamb our sin is gone, through the brass serpent our serpentine poison is terminated, and through the dove we have been regenerated. Before we were regenerated we were serpents, but today we are doves who can soar. Today we have Christ as the Spirit to be the dove within us. Something within us is always trying to soar. Without Christ as the soaring Spirit, we could not bear one another. We all need Christ as the soaring One.</P><P>In this life of anxiety, who does not have any trouble? Before a brother was married, he had trouble without a wife. But now that he is married he still has trouble. We cannot escape from the troubles of human life. Where shall we go then? We should simply come to Jesus to enjoy Him as the soaring One. We have been redeemed by Christ as the Lamb slain for us, we have been delivered from the serpentine poison by Christ being the brass serpent to deliver us, and we have been regenerated by Christ as the dove, the soaring Spirit, to enliven us. This is the unchangeable base of our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Eternal Life of God, the Uncreated Life, the Indestructible Life</H2><P>The base of our growth in life is also the eternal life of God (John 3:15; 1 John 1:2), which we have received in our regeneration. This is the divine life, uncreated and indestructible (Heb. 7:16), which is the strongest and most solid base for our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. God Dwelling in Us</H2><P>God, the processed and consummated Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19), who dwells in us (1 John 3:24; 4:13), living, moving, acting, and realized as the indwelling and consummated Spirit (John 14:17; 7:39), is the most rich and living base for our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Seed of God Abiding in Us</H2><P>Another base for us to grow in the divine life is that the divine seed of God abides in us, enabling us not to practice sin, not to live in sin (1 John 3:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Destruction of the Works of the Devil and the Casting Out of Him as the Ruler of the World</H2><P>The works of the devil, Satan, all have been destroyed, and he as the ruler of the world has been cast out by Christ through His death in the manifestation in His flesh (1 John 3:8; John 12:31b). This is also a vital base for our growth in the divine life, based upon which we have overcome Satan, the evil one (1 John 2:13b, 14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Judgment on the World</H2><P>Christ's death on the cross in His flesh has put the world, the cosmos of Satan, on His cross and has judged it and terminated it there (John 12:31a). For us to grow in the divine life we need to overcome the world (1 John 5:4-5), and the world was judged and terminated by Christ through His death on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Way</H2><P>We also have the way to grow in life. The way of the growth in life is by eating Christ, drinking Christ, and breathing Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Eating Christ</H2><P>For the maintenance and growth of our physical life, eating is vital. Jesus is the bread of life for us to eat so that we can grow in the divine life. Eating Jesus is the way! (See stanza four of Hymns, #1226.) He is the Lamb, the brass serpent, and the dove as the base of our growth in life. Now He is our food for us to eat as the way to grow in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. As the Living Bread from Heaven<br>Embodied in His Words of Eternal Life</H2><P>We can grow in the divine life by eating Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life (John 6:57b-58a, 51, 68). Every word in the Bible is the embodiment of the eternal life, so to eat Jesus, we must take in the Word. Where is Jesus today? He is in the Spirit and in the Word. The Spirit is within us, and the Word is in our hand. This is why we encourage all the saints to spend at least ten to twenty minutes every morning to exercise their spirit in prayer with the Word. Throughout church history, many godly saints read the holy Word prayerfully. On the one hand, we read the Word, and on the other hand, we pray with what we read, not with our own word, but with God's loving, holy Word.</P><P>When we come to a verse like John 1:29&#151;"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"&#151;we should not merely read it. We should read it with prayer by saying, "Lord, praise You, You are the Lamb of God. I love You. Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! Lord Jesus, thank You for being the Lamb of God who took away my sin." The proper way to read the Bible is to read the Bible prayerfully. Our spiritual nourishment does not depend on the number of verses or chapters we read but on how many of the Lord's words we have eaten (Jer. 15:16). We have to eat by pray-reading a few verses every morning. By eating Christ as the living bread embodied in His words of eternal life, we can grow in the divine life. Without eating, no one can grow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. As the Tree of Life</H2><P>In the book of Revelation, we are charged to eat Christ as the tree of life (2:7b; 22:2). Genesis 2 reveals that the tree of life is good for food (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. As the Hidden Manna</H2><P>The book of Revelation also speaks of Christ as the hidden manna (2:17b). The open manna was for the Lord's people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. We should get away from all persons and distractions to have a personal time with the Lord, in which we can enjoy Him in a hidden way. We can enjoy Christ in a public way with all the saints, but we still need a time apart from everyone to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna. We need to be in a private place to contact Him, to praise Him, and to enjoy Him in the holy Word. A number of us may eat only an open, public Christ, but we all need a time to eat a private, hidden Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Drinking Christ</H2><P>Christ is eatable and Christ is drinkable. We need to drink Christ as the life-giving Spirit (John 7:37-39) and as the water of life (John 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6b; 22:17b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By Breathing Christ as the Spiritual Breath</H2><P>We also grow in the divine life by breathing Christ as the spiritual breath (John 20:22). Just as eating, drinking, and breathing are essential to our physical life, they are also essential to our spiritual life. If a person does not eat, he will eventually die. If a person does not drink, he will die even more quickly. But if a person does not breathe, he will die in the quickest way. This shows us that breathing is the most vital thing. In his Gospel the apostle John told us that our Christ is eatable, drinkable, and breathable.</P><P>In 1958 in Taipei I received this light from the Lord, and I told people for the first time that Jesus is eatable. My subject was on eating Jesus. I quoted John 6:57, where the Lord says, "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." After the message, a professor from a top university told me that my message was very good but that what I said seemed too wild. He wondered how we could eat Jesus. I told him that we simply had to take what the Lord said in John 6. The Lord Himself told us to eat Him. A husky American is actually the totality of what he has eaten of the riches of America. We are what we eat. Someone who eats beef all the time will even begin to smell like beef. We become what we eat, and we express what we eat. When we eat Jesus with all His riches, we smell like Him (2 Cor. 2:15), we express Him, and we become Him.</P><P>We need to eat Him, and we also need to drink Him and breathe Him. Eating is mentioned in John 6; drinking is mentioned in John 4 and 7; and breathing is mentioned in John 20:22. In the same Gospel we are told Jesus is eatable, Jesus is drinkable, and Jesus is breathable. It is by eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord that we grow in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Its Progression</H2><P>Now that we have seen the source, the base, and the way of the believers' growth in life in the writings of John, we want to go on to see its progression. Many immigrants came to the United States from the Far East with their children, and many of their children became bigger than they are. This is because they all drank much of the American milk. Surely that drinking of milk gave them the progression in the growth of their physical life. When you eat and drink, you progress in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the Young Children</H2><P>John said that the young children are those who know the Father (1 John 2:13c) and who have received the anointing to know all things (vv. 18-27). Even though you may be young in the Lord, you know the Father and you have the anointing within. When you say, "Abba, Father," the Spirit as the ointment is moving within you. The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling Spirit. Every saved one has the Spirit within him. When we cry, "Abba, Father!" the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Growing into the Young Men</H2><P>Eventually, the young children in the Lord grow into the young men. We must remember that our growth is for the building up of the Body of Christ. The young men are those who are strong in the word of God (1 John 2:14b), who have overcome the evil one (vv. 13b, 14c), and who do not love the world or the things in the world (vv. 15-17). In the United States, it is difficult not to love the world because there are too many worldly attractions here. The worldly pleasures, styles, and attractions frustrate us from growing in the divine life. The church needs the young men growing up for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. As the Young Men Growing into the Fathers</H2><P>As the young men progress in the divine life, they grow into the fathers, who know Him&#151;Christ, who is from the beginning (1 John 2:13a, 14a). Some among us are older&#151;not only older in age but also older in the Lord. They should be considered as spiritual fathers. These fathers know Christ, who is from the beginning. For the young children to know the Father is easy. But Christ is a mystery, so it is not easy to know Christ. Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2), and He has a mystery called the church, which is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ in totality is a mystery. He is both God and man. He is the Father (Isa. 9:6), the Son (John 1:18), and the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Because He is so mysterious, it is not easy to know Him. When you know Christ, the all-inclusive One, you are a spiritual father. If the churches do not have fathers, they will not be able to grow in the divine life that well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. For the Transformation into White Stones</H2><P>The believers' growth in life is for their transformation into white stones, justified and approved by the Lord (Rev. 2:17b) for God's building&#151;the New Jerusalem (3:12), firstly in the millennium in the initial stage (2:7; 3:12) and lastly in the new heaven and new earth in its ultimate consummation (21:1-3).</P><P>The apostle John told us that some of the saints eventually become white stones in the eyes of God. Stones are for building. The color white signifies justification, approval, and acceptance. By our growth in life, we eventually become transformed for God's building, and God's building is the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem.</P><P>Revelation 3:12 tells us that the transformed saints will be built up into the temple of God as pillars. The temple of God equals the New Jerusalem in the coming ages (Rev. 21:22). The transformed saints will not only be stones but also parts (signified by the pillar) built into God's building.</P><P>The New Jerusalem as God's unique building firstly will appear in its initial stage in the millennium, the thousand years, and lastly it will appear in the new heaven and new earth in its consummated stage forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Growth in the Divine Life for Transformation Being Vital for the Building Up<br>of the Body of Christ Today</H2><P>What we have just covered in this chapter concerning the growth in the divine life issuing in transformation for the building up of the Body of Christ may be considered an extract of all the writings of the apostle John, from his one Gospel, through his three Epistles, to his last writing, Revelation. This extract unveils to us the vitalness of our growth in the divine life for the metabolic transformation that the organic Body of Christ may be built up even today. Even though we have been regenerated and sanctified to a certain extent, we are still below the standard of the requirements for the building up of the Body of Christ. For us to be the proper materials for God's unique building, the organic Body of Christ, we still need very much to grow in the divine life that we may be transformed with it into the glorious image of the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). If we are natural, fleshly, and in ourselves, we can neither be built up nor become the proper material for the building up of the Body of Christ. We have to grow in life until we are transformed. As long as we remain in our disposition, our character, and our peculiar traits, we cannot be built up with anyone. We must be transformed for God's building.</P><P>If we are too much in our natural person, we cannot be built up with others. We have to be transformed. Transformation is a kind of metabolic change in nature and appearance. In transformation we are changed not just in our form and our appearance but in our very element and our very essence. Although we may be American or Chinese, we should grow and be transformed until we are less American or Chinese and more Christian, more Christ-like. We all need such a metabolic change in the element and essence of our being through our growth in the divine life. May the Lord bless all of us with the bountiful supply of His abounding grace for the practical building up of His organic Body, that the eternal purpose of God's eternal economy may be fulfilled in our age.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:2b, 2c;

We worship You that You are the speaking God. You have been speaking from the first age until this age. We believe that in this meeting You will speak Your word again to us. We look to You for new light, new enlightenment, and up-to-date, instant, inspiring utterance. Lord Jesus, stand with us; be one spirit with us in our speaking. In our speaking, do speak Your word. We desire to be one with You. How we thank You that You have worked and have accomplished and consummated everything so that You can be one with us and we can be one with You! And in fact, we really are one with You. We believe that even at this moment, while we are here waiting on You and looking unto You, You are really one with us. We have the assurance that we are here one with You and one with one another. Thank You for Your prevailing blood that counters the enemy. Lord, we hate Your enemy. We accuse him before You. Lord, put him to shame, glorify Yourself, and bless all the saints. Amen.</P><P>In the Bible there are three main writers of the Epistles. The first, no doubt, is Paul; then there is John, and then Peter. In the previous chapter and in this chapter our intention is to cover in the writings of these three main writers of the New Testament the matter of the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. In the previous chapter we covered this matter in the writings of John. In this chapter we will see this same matter in the writings of Peter and Paul.</P><P>John's writing is very divine and mysterious, yet the words and the sentences that he wrote are very simple. In John's writings we can see that the Triune God became a man to live on this earth (John 1:1, 14). Eventually, this One is life to us (1:4), and He is also the life supply to us. He is even our food (6:57b-58a, 51, 68; Rev. 2:7b; 22:2; 2:17b), our drink (John 7:37-39; 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6b; 22:17b), and our breath (John 20:22). He is all the necessities of our daily spiritual life. We need Him as our food, our bread, our drink, and our breath. Every morning we need to take some time to enjoy Him. Without enjoying Him, I could not live Him and I could not speak Him. Hallelujah, we have Him and we can partake of Him!</P><P>To consider the matter of the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ in the writings of Peter and Paul, we need a sober mind. It is very interesting to see that all these three great writers&#151;John, Peter, and Paul&#151;touched the matter of the growth in life. Furthermore, their touching of the growth in life is for the building up of the Body of Christ. In the entire universe there is only one building of God. It is true that God created the heavens and the earth, and He even did some remodeling of His creation, but God does not have two buildings. We may think that the old creation, composed of the original heavens and the original earth, is one kind of building, and that the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center are another kind of building. Thus, we may consider that God has two buildings. However, we need to realize that God's building in the new creation is something worked out of the old creation.</P><P>First, God created the old creation. The last item created by God in the old creation was man. God first created the heavens with the angels (Isa. 42:5a; Zech. 12:1a; Job 38:7). Then God created the earth with myriads of items on the earth (Zech. 12:1b; Job 38:4; Isa. 42:5b). Finally, the last item created by God was man. After man, God did not create anything else; He stopped His creating work. Man is the consummation of God's creation because God's intention is not to have the stars or the mountains or the animals; God's intention is to have a man who bears His image and has His likeness. Man was created not after man's kind but after God's kind. Genesis 1 tells us that God created all the plants and animals after their own kind (vv. 11-12, 21, 24-25). Eventually, God created His last item&#151;man (vv. 26-27). God did not create man after man's kind. God created man after God's kind. As men, we all bear God's image and walk in God's likeness. So we as man are of God's kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE<br>UNVEILED IN THE WRITINGS OF PETER</H2><P>First, we need to see the believers' growth in the divine life unveiled in the writings of Peter. Although Peter was a fisherman who wrote awkwardly in Greek, his writing is very high and very solemn, with no lightness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Its Base</H2><P>The believers' growth in life has a base, and this base is unveiled in Peter's writings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Sanctification of the Spirit</H2><P>In Peter's writings the first item as the base for the believers' growth in the divine life is the sanctification of the Spirit (1 Pet. 1:2b). To sanctify something means to separate it and make it holy unto God. When something is sanctified, it is separated unto God for God's purpose; hence, it becomes holy. We were born as Adam's descendants. As such, we were not holy. But one day as we were listening to the gospel, the Holy Spirit of God came to sanctify us, to separate us unto God and make us holy. This is the first step of the Spirit's sanctification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Redemption of Christ<br>through His Vicarious Death on the Cross</H2><P>The sanctification of the Spirit, the seeking of us, the lost sinners, by the searching Spirit is based upon Christ's redemption accomplished by Him through His vicarious death on the tree (the cross&#151;1 Pet. 2:24a). In that vicarious death Christ, the Righteous, died for the sins of us, the unrighteous (1 Pet. 3:18). This is a base for us believers to receive the eternal life of God (John 3:15) and to live to righteousness (1 Pet. 2:24b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Sprinkling of Christ's Blood,<br>as the Precious Blood of the Lamb<br>without Blemish and without Spot</H2><P>Based upon the blood-shedding redemption of Christ, right after the sanctification of the Spirit, the sprinkling of Christ's redeeming blood, as the precious blood of the Lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Pet. 1:2c, 19) is applied to us. The sprinkling of Christ's blood indicates redemption. Some may think that the sanctification of the Holy Spirit should not be before the redemption of Christ.</P><P>In Luke 15 the Lord Jesus spoke three parables that correspond to the Divine Trinity in God's saving of sinners. The first parable concerns a man seeking a lost sheep (vv. 3-7), the second concerns a woman seeking her lost coin (vv. 8-10), and the third concerns a father receiving his prodigal son (vv. 11-32). In these three parables the father signifies the divine Father in the Trinity, the man signifies Christ the Savior, and the woman signifies the Holy Spirit. The woman's work in seeking the lost coin was the Spirit's sanctification, which transpired before our repentance and led us to believe in Christ that we might participate in the sprinkling of Christ's blood.</P><P>Without the sanctification of the Spirit, the prodigal son in Luke 15 could never have been awakened to realize his pitiful condition and make a decision to rise up and return to his father's house (vv. 16-21). Before he returned home, the Spirit as the seeking "woman" had done the seeking work already.</P><P>After the prodigal son returned home, the father told the servants to put the best robe on the son. That was a sign of justification, implying redemption. Hence, at that time the son was redeemed, approved, and accepted. According to Luke 15, that occurred after the Spirit as the seeking woman found the prodigal as the lost coin. Therefore, before redemption was applied to the returned prodigal, the Holy Spirit first did something to sanctify, to separate, the sinner and cause him to repent.</P><P>The Holy Spirit's sanctification is not once for all. According to the New Testament, the Holy Spirit's sanctification occurs in three steps (2 Thes. 2:13 and note 133). The first step takes place before the sinner's repentance in order to stir up the sinner's repentance, to separate and sanctify the sinner and bring him to Christ. This is the sanctification referred to in 1 Peter 1:2 and Luke 15. Then, after the sinner repents and receives Christ, at that moment the sinner receives Christ's redemption. At the same time the sinner is regenerated and experiences the second step of the Holy Spirit's sanctification, which is mainly a positional sanctification (Heb. 13:12; 1 Cor. 6:11). Later, in the course of his Christian life, such a saved sinner will be sanctified dispositionally (Rom. 6:19, 22). This is the third step of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>As presented in Peter's writings, the first item as the base of the believers' growth in the divine life is the Spirit's sanctification. Since the Holy Spirit has sanctified us, we all have this base, and we can all grow in life upon it. Because we all have been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, we are willing to forsake the pleasures of this world and enjoy Christ in the church life so that we can gain more of Christ.</P><P>The sanctification of the Spirit ushered us to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, which refers to redemption and issues in life (Rom. 5:10, 17-18). Such a redemption through the shed blood of Christ (Eph. 1:7) has been applied to us for our enjoyment. We all need to realize and be fully assured that we have been sprinkled with the blood of Christ. Because we have been sprinkled with the precious blood of Christ, we have been redeemed. We are the blood-sprinkled people. How good this is! First, we were sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and then we were sprinkled with the blood of Jesus. Therefore, God can justify us, receive us, and accept us because we have been redeemed and sprinkled with the blood. Now there is no problem between us and God. All the problems are covered under the blood. This is a strong base for us to grow in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Regeneration through Christ's Resurrection</H2><P>The next item in Peter's writings as the base of the believers' growth in life is the regeneration through Christ's resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3b). Christ not only shed His blood for our redemption; He also rose from the dead to regenerate us. It may seem strange to say that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. According to our view, we were regenerated at a certain time after we were born. However, 1 Peter 1:3 tells us that we were regenerated together, as a group of God's chosen people, not one by one. When Christ resurrected, millions of believers in Christ throughout all the centuries were regenerated together as a group.</P><P>The Bible tells us that when Christ died, we died with Him and in Him (Rom. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:14b; Gal. 2:20), and when Christ rose, we were resurrected with Him and in Him (Eph. 2:5-6). In that resurrection we were all regenerated in Christ.</P><P>Nevertheless, it may still seem illogical to say that two thousand years ago we were regenerated through Christ's resurrection, when at that time we were not yet born. How could we be regenerated before we were born? How could we be reborn, born a second time, before we were born the first time? To our small mind this may not be logical, but to God's great mind, it is quite logical. This is because with God there is no time element. God sees only the facts; He is not concerned with the time. The time is not important to Him. What is important to Him is the fact that you are regenerated. We were sanctified by the Spirit, sprinkled with the blood, and regenerated through Christ's resurrection. These items are a strong base for our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The God-allotted, Equally Precious Faith</H2><P>Another item in Peter's writings that constitutes the base of the believers' growth in life is the God-allotted, equally precious faith (2 Pet. 1:1b). We Christians are a particular people, a people who are particular in our faith. Our faith is a mystery. It is common for people to say, "If I cannot see something, I cannot believe." But we Christians believe in what we have never seen. Although we have never seen Jesus, we believe in Him (1 Pet. 1:8). Although we have never seen Him, we have the full assurance that Jesus is real. In the whole universe there is such a person named Jesus who is both God and man. We know that such a One is real because the Bible tells us so. It is by our faith that we believe that the Bible is true.</P><P>Second Peter 1:1 says that our faith is allotted to us by God. It is a portion given to us by God. In ourselves we cannot produce faith, but God has given us faith as a portion. The expression "allotted faith equally precious as ours" in 2 Peter 1:1 indicates that in the whole universe there is only one faith as a portion allotted to all God's redeemed people. In the Old Testament the land of Canaan was the unique good land allotted by God as an inheritance to His people Israel. When the people of Israel entered into the good land and possessed it, that one good land was divided into portions and allotted to each family of the twelve tribes of Israel (Num. 33:51-54). Similarly, in the universe there is one great matter which is called faith. God has allotted a portion of this unique faith to each of His chosen people. Thus, we all have the same unique faith. We all have an allotted portion of this one faith. We did not receive this faith from others; God allotted this faith to us. The way in which God allotted this faith to us is a mystery of mysteries.</P><P>At the juncture when we believed, it was not we who were believing; it was God who was allotting a portion of the unique faith into us. The name of that unique faith is Jesus Christ. The faith that we have to believe in Christ is Christ Himself (Rom. 3:22 and note 221; Gal. 2:16a and note 161). At the time that we heard the gospel and repented, we appreciated the Lord Jesus. At that very juncture, this hidden Jesus, this mysterious Jesus, secretly entered into us and became our faith in Him. The more we said, "Jesus," the more we believed in Him, and the more He became lovable to us. What a sweet, precious Jesus we have! In this universe there is only one Jesus who is faith to us. Therefore, our faith is uniquely one. We have such a faith as our base so that we can grow in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Divine Power Which Has Granted to Us<br>All Things Relating to Life and Godliness</H2><P>Another vital item as the base for our growth in life is the divine power which has granted to us all things relating to life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3a). The divine power has given us all things that concern life and godliness. We desire to be holy, and we also aspire to be like God, that is, to be godly, because all things concerning these matters have been sown into us. Jesus as the Sower has sown Himself into us as the seed of holiness and godliness. The desire and aspiration for these things are included in that one seed. The tiny seeds of flowers are sown into the earth, and when they grow, they produce flowers of many different colors. In the same way, holiness, godliness, and all things that relate to life and godliness have been given to us. These things are all in us. If we do not seek holiness and godliness, we do not feel happy. But as long as we are seeking holiness and godliness, we are very happy, because within us we do have such a base.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Precious and Exceedingly Great Promises<br>and the Divine Nature</H2><P>The last items in Peter's writings as the base for our growth in life are the precious and exceedingly great promises and the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). In the New Testament there are hundreds of precious and exceedingly great promises. One such promise is found in Matthew 28:20: "And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Another great and precious promise is 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you." There are many promises like these given to us in the New Testament.</P><P>In addition to these promises, we also have a share of God's divine nature. According to 2 Peter 1:4, it is through the precious and exceedingly great promises that we have become partakers of the divine nature. The matter of nature is very important. Hens lay eggs because it is according to their nature. The apple tree and all fruit trees bring forth fruit also by and according to their natures. This means that if we have a particular nature, we are able to do things that are by and according to that nature, and if we do not have a certain nature, we are not able to do things that are according to that nature. As believers in Christ, we have God's nature. How wonderful this is! We not only have God's life, but we also have His nature. We desire to be holy, godly, and spiritual because these things are according to God's nature, of which we partake. Because we have God's nature, to do the things of God is natural to us, because the divine things are according to our divine nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Its Way</H2><P>The way of the believers' growth in life is also revealed in the writings of Peter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Drinking the Milk of the Word</H2><P>As revealed in Peter's writings, the believers grow in life by drinking the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2a). Every word in the Bible is a bottle of milk. The milk for our growth in life is in the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Enjoying the Grace of Christ<br>and the All Grace of God</H2><P>The believers grow in life also by enjoying the grace of Christ and the all grace of God (2 Pet. 3:18; 1 Pet. 5:10). The grace of Christ is just Christ Himself distributed to us through His redemption for our enjoyment, and the all grace of God is simply the processed and consummated Triune God to be our life supply in all aspects. God is a God of many aspects, and every aspect of God is grace to us. Whenever we contact God, call on Him, drink Him, eat Him, and breathe Him in, we receive grace.</P><P>The way for us believers to grow in life is to drink the spiritual milk of the word, to breathe in Christ as our grace, and to take in God in His Divine Trinity as the all grace to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Progression</H2><P>Peter's writings also unveil to us that the believers' growth in life has its progression. When we are growing, we are progressing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From Babyhood Growing into the Priesthood</H2><P>In the progression of our growth in the divine life, from babyhood we believers grow into the priesthood (1 Pet. 2:2, 5). We need to go on in our growth from the nursing babyhood to the serving priesthood. Whenever we pray, we function as priests. By our praying we can grow out of our babyhood into the priesthood. This is the progression in our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. From Faith to Virtue, from Virtue to Knowledge,<br>from Knowledge to Self-control, from Self-control<br>to Endurance, from Endurance to Godliness,<br>from Godliness to Brotherly Love, and<br>from Brotherly Love to the Divine Love</H2><P>According to 2 Peter 1:5-7, the progression of the believers' growth in the divine life is from the God-allotted faith to the divine love of God through the six steps of virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, and brotherly love. </P><P>Virtue is our sweet Christian conduct. Love is a virtue. Kindness and humility are also virtues. Our Christian virtues in our growing in the divine life are the spiritual expressions of the divine attributes of God.</P><P>First, we have the God-allotted faith as a base, and then we progress in our growth in the divine life from faith to virtue. From virtue we need to progress further to knowledge. We need to know the Bible, to know God according to the Bible. We need to know God in the Old Testament and also in the New Testament. We need to know God in the four Gospels, in the fourteen Epistles of the apostle Paul, and in all the other books of the New Testament. Therefore, we must learn to study the Bible to get the divine knowledge in the proper and full way.</P><P>From knowledge we need to progress in our growth in life to self-control. A foolish man is always free in everything. If you are a man full of the divine knowledge, full of the knowledge of the divine truth, you will know how to restrict yourself, that is, how to control yourself. Some of the saints do not know how to restrict their speaking. Those who do not have the proper spiritual knowledge may behave in a very foolish way. They may be like a truck without brakes. We need to progress by our growth in life from knowledge to self-control, self-restriction.</P><P>Then, we need to progress from self-control to endurance. Whereas self-control is to deal with ourselves, endurance is to bear with others and with circumstances. These two items should be the fragrant virtues of those who have seen Christ as the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy and who are pursuing Christ, growing Christ, living Christ, and magnifying Christ. Then they would progress in the growth of the divine life into the state of godliness, God-likeness, to express God in Christ in all His attributes as their virtues. We all need to progress in this way to the next step, that is, brotherly love in warm affection, characterized by delight and pleasure. Our godliness needs to be supplied with such a brotherly love. </P><P>From this brotherly love we still need to progress until we reach the climax, the divine love, which is God Himself. Every item in this progression is Christ expressed in our living of Him. The base, the foundation, of this progression is the God-allotted faith, and its capstone, its topstone, is the divine love of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Its Issue</H2><P>In Peter's writings, the believers' growth in the divine life also has its issues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Enjoy the Continual and Daily Salvation</H2><P>In the writings of Peter the first issue of the believers' growth in life is to enjoy the continual and daily salvation (1 Pet. 2:2b). We need to drink the milk of the word so that we may grow unto salvation. This is not the salvation from perdition, from hell; rather, it is the salvation in our daily life. To overcome our temper, especially in relation to our spouse, we need salvation. To be a husband or wife requires a great deal of salvation every day. Without experiencing salvation in many aspects, we cannot be a proper Christian husband or wife.</P><P>Every husband is a trouble to his wife. Every husband is a particular person who has particular traits. How much salvation the wives need! Every wife needs to learn to rely on God's salvation, not on her own cleverness, in dealing with her husband. We all need salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Fruitful</H2><P>Another issue of the growth in life is to be fruitful (2 Pet. 1:8). When we grow in life, we will bear fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Be Transformed into Living Stones<br>as Materials for the Building Up<br>of the Spiritual House of God, Consummating<br>in the Priesthood for Offering Up<br>Spiritual Sacrifices Acceptable to God</H2><P>Peter in his first Epistle unveils to us that the Lord is a living stone and that we, by contacting Him, also become living stones (2:4-5a). We were created as pieces of clay in nature (Gen. 2:7a; Rom. 9:21), but by growing in Christ we become stones, transformed metabolically in our nature. These stones are suitable as materials for the building up of the spiritual house of God (1 Pet. 2:5b), which consummates in the New Testament priesthood of the gospel for offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God in our gospel preaching (1 Pet. 2:5c, 9). To preach the gospel is to tell out the sweet virtues, in a sweet way, of the Lord, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</P><P>This kind of gospel preaching, as an issue of our transformation through our growth in the divine life, should be by a group of believers (not by some individualistic believers) built up into a priesthood (not some individualistic priests) as a corporate body of priests, carrying out the spreading of the Lord's glad tidings as a corporate testimony to the sinners in the world, in telling out the sweet virtues, such as love, lovingkindness, grace, light, forgiveness, redemption, salvation, etc., of the Lord in a sweet and delightful way. Surely this kind of victorious, vital, and corporate trumpeting of the good news from the heavens would be triumphant and successful. This is the goal which our vital groups should reach!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Its Consummation</H2><P>Peter also tells us that the believers' growth in the divine life also has its consummation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Enter into the Eternal Kingdom of<br>Their Lord Jesus Christ Richly and Bountifully</H2><P>The believers' growth in the divine life consummates in their entering into the eternal kingdom, that is, firstly, the one-thousand-year kingdom and then the eternal kingdom, of the Lord Jesus Christ richly and bountifully (2 Pet. 1:11). We all will eventually enter into the kingdom of Christ, but some will enter richly and bountifully, whereas others will enter poorly and scarcely. We need to grow in life so that we can enter into the kingdom of Christ richly and bountifully.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Glorified with God's Eternal Glory as<br>the Redemption of Their Body in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The believers' growth in the divine life will also consummate in their being glorified with God's eternal glory as the redemption of their body in the New Jerusalem (1 Pet. 5:10). Our spirit has been regenerated, and our soul is now being transformed. When Christ comes, our body will be transfigured, that is, redeemed into God's glory. That will be our glorification in the coming age. All this depends on our growth in the divine life. Thus, our growth in the divine life is good not only for the building of God's house but also for our enjoyment in the kingdom and in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE<br>UNVEILED IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL</H2><P>The believers' growth in life is unveiled more in the writings of Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Its Base</H2><P>In the writings of the three main writers of the New Testament concerning our growth in the divine life, the base unveiled in Paul's writings is the fullest and the strongest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Righteousness of God</H2><P>The gospel preached by the apostle Paul is based upon the righteousness of God (Rom. 1:17) for God's full salvation in Christ. Hence, the righteousness of God becomes the first base for the growth in the divine life of the believers, who have participated in Christ's salvation based upon God's righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Redemption of Christ</H2><P>Christ's complete redemption (Rom. 3:24b) is accomplished according to the requirements of God's righteousness in full and has fulfilled those requirements up to the full satisfaction of God. Hence, it becomes the most solid base for Christ's redeemed people to grow in the divine life. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Justification by God</H2><P>Based upon the complete and full redemption of Christ, God has justified all the believers in Christ (Rom. 3:24a; 8:30b) and reconciled them all to Himself in the next item. These are also solid bases for the believers in Christ to grow in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Reconciliation to God</H2><P>God has reconciled to Himself those whom He has justified in Christ based upon the redemption of Christ (Rom. 5:10a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Washing of Regeneration</H2><P>God has regenerated us following His reconciling of us to Himself to wash away the old creation from us (Titus 3:5). Both this item and the next item are vital bases for us to grow in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Renewing of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Going along with His regeneration God has renewed us by the germination of His Holy Spirit to have a new beginning in His new creation (Titus 3:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Complete Salvation of God</H2><P>The salvation of God mentioned in Romans 1:16 comprises all the different aspects in the full salvation of God, which is very basic to the believers' growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Salvation of God in the Life of Christ</H2><P>The complete and full salvation of God comprises one particular aspect, that is, to save us by the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10b) in all the matters of our daily life in the entire course of our Christian life, especially in regenerating, transforming, conforming, and glorifying us. This is the crucial base for us to grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Putting Us into Christ</H2><P>In God's complete and full salvation, the all-inclusive item is God's putting us into Christ in an organic union with Him, making Him our life, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, and every positive thing (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4). This is the all-inclusive base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Identification with Christ<br>in His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension</H2><P>Our identification with Christ in His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension (Rom. 6:3-6; Eph. 2:6), making His story our history, is also a crucial base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. The Abounding Grace of God</H2><P>In addition to all the above items, Paul in his writings assures us of the abounding, multiplying grace of God (Rom. 5:20), which is the grace of Christ that is sufficient to meet all our needs in our Christian life (2 Cor. 12:9) and leads us to reign in life in Christ (Rom. 5:21). Such an abounding grace is needed as a base for our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Making Us the Church as the Body of Christ</H2><P>The dispensing of the blessing of the Divine Trinity to make us the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:3-23) is a great base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Creating Both the Jews and the Gentiles<br>into One New Man</H2><P>Christ has created the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one new man through His crucifixion (Eph. 2:13-16) and has made Himself every member of this new man (Col. 3:10-11). This is a base to our growth in the divine life as great as making us the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Making All the Believers in Christ<br>a New Creation</H2><P>Christ has made all His believers a new creation out of the old creation (2 Cor. 5:17). This is also a vital base for our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Making the Believers One Spirit with the Lord</H2><P>God's complete and full salvation has made all the believers in Christ one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the climax of the base to our growth in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Its Way</H2><P>In Paul's writings the way of the believers' growth in life is revealed in much more detail than in Peter's writings. According to Paul's writings, the believers grow in life by drinking the spiritual milk (1 Cor. 3:2a; Heb. 5:12b), by eating the spiritual food (Heb. 5:14a), by drinking the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b), by being watered (1 Cor. 3:6b, 7b), and by God operating in them (Phil. 2:13). The believers also grow in life by Christ living in them and making His home in them (Gal. 2:20a; Eph. 3:17a). Christ is not only living in us but also making His home in us. He desires to get Himself settled within us.</P><P>The believers grow in life also by the Spirit of Jesus Christ supplying bountifully in them (Phil. 1:19b). With the Spirit of Jesus Christ there is a rich and bountiful supply in everything.</P><P>The believers grow in life also by the growth of God (Col. 2:19). As we grow in the divine life, God also grows in us. Since God is complete and perfect in Himself, we may wonder why God needs to grow. It is true that God is complete and perfect in Himself, but He is not complete and perfect in us. In most of us God is too little. How much God do you have within you? Only God knows the answer to this question. Nevertheless, we all need to allow God to grow in us.</P><P>Finally, in Paul's writings the believers grow in life by the supply out from the Head, Christ (Eph. 4:16a). We are members of the Body of Christ. While we as members are growing, Christ the Head is supplying. Out from the Head we receive the supply for us to grow in life. In our spiritual life, day by day we need to eat sufficiently, rightly, and properly to receive the supply from Christ the Head. We all need to practice eating, drinking, and breathing. We also need to learn how to rest. To be healthy we need five things: eating, drinking, breathing, resting, and exercising. If we do these five things in our Christian life, we will be spiritually healthy and will surely grow in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Progression</H2><P>In Paul's writings we also see the progression of the believers' growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From the Fleshly Man to the Soulish Man,<br>and from the Soulish Man to the Spiritual Man</H2><P>In our growth in life, we the believers progress from the fleshly man to the soulish man, and from the soulish man to the spiritual man (1 Cor. 3:3; 2:14; 3:1a). We need to ask ourselves what kind of man we are: a fleshly man, a soulish man, or a spiritual man? A fleshly man is one whose behavior is under the influence of his fleshly nature and partakes of the character of the flesh. Such a person may become angry and lose his temper easily. A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul (including the mind, the emotion, and the will) to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring his spirit, not using his spirit, and even behaving as if he did not have a spirit (Jude 19). Such a person may not anger easily, but he is full of thoughts and reasonings in his mind. A soulish person has no capacity to receive the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 2:14). A spiritual man is one who denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit, that is, his regenerated spirit, which is occupied and energized by the Spirit of God, to dominate his entire being. A spiritual man lives by such a spirit, moving and acting according to it (Rom. 8:4).</P><P>If you lose your temper easily, you are a fleshly man. If you are always reasoning in your mind and murmuring in your emotion (Phil. 2:14), you are a soulish man. If, regardless of what happens to you, you simply call on the name of the Lord, remain in your spirit, and do everything according to the Spirit (Rom. 8:4b), you are a spiritual man. Instead of reasoning and murmuring with our spouse, with the saints in the church, or with the elders, we should simply call, "O Lord," all the time, living in our spirit. Then we will be a spiritual man.</P><P>We should not think that calling, "O Lord," is an easy thing. It is not easy. Sometimes when you are in the flesh, you may try to say, "O Lord," but you may not even be able to say "O." To say, "O Lord," requires a great deal of strength. We need to grow in life to the extent that whatever happens to us, we will respond by calling, "O Lord," without murmuring, reasoning, complaining, or arguing. If we are such spiritual persons, we will be suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ. Otherwise, if we are fleshly or soulish persons, we will not be able to be built up with others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. From Infancy to Maturity&#151;Full Growth</H2><P>According to Paul's writings, the believers also progress in their growth in life from infancy to maturity, that is, to full growth (1 Cor. 3:1b; Col. 1:28b; Eph. 4:13b). Through our growth in life we the believers mature with Christ as the element of the divine life unto full growth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. From Dust to Plants, and<br>from Plants to Precious Stones</H2><P>We the believers also progress in our growth in life from dust to plants, and from plants to precious stones (1 Cor. 3:6a, 7a, 12a). Originally, man was made by God of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). In order for dust to become a plant, there is the need of some seed to be sown into the dust. Then the dust and the seed join together to grow, thus becoming a plant. Christ has been sown into us as the seed of life, and we are the dust, the earth, as the soil. As we cooperate with Christ to grow together with Him, a sprout comes out, and that sprout is the plant. </P><P>Then, according to 1 Corinthians 3, the believers as plants all need to be transformed from plants to minerals, that is, into precious stones, for the building up of the Body of Christ. Thus, first we need growth, and second, we need transformation. In the beginning of our Christian life our primary need is to grow. Our growth in life is very important. Eventually, our growth brings in transformation, a metabolic change in which God's divine life and nature spread throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ with His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged. We need to grow from dust to plants, and we need to grow further and be transformed from plants into precious stones for the building of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Its Issue</H2><P>In the writings of Paul the issue of the believers' growth in life is also richly revealed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Growing into Christ, the Head, in All Things</H2><P>In our growth in the divine life we the believers grow into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15). For the sisters, combing their hair and clothing themselves may be two small problems in their daily life. If we ask some sisters to have morning revival for ten minutes, they may say that they do not have time; but they may have time to spend twenty minutes before the mirror to comb their hair. This means that these sisters may be growing into Christ in many things, but not in the combing of their hair. Shopping may be another area in the sisters' daily life in which they need to grow up into Christ. Many sisters read the newspaper not for the important items of the news but to locate the sales in the department stores. If the sisters can overcome in the matter of shopping, they will grow very much in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Growing unto a Full-grown Man</H2><P>In our growth in life, we the believers also grow unto a full-grown man (Eph. 4:13b). We should not remain as infants or merely as adolescents in the divine life; we must grow unto a full-grown man. This is the issue of our growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Growing unto the Measure<br>of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</H2><P>The believers also grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). The fullness of Christ here denotes the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ is just the Body of Christ. Like a man's physical body, the Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a measure. We all need to grow unto the proper measurement of the stature of the Body of Christ, which is actually the stature of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Growing unto the Building Up of the Body</H2><P>In our growth in life we the believers also grow unto the building up of the Body (Eph. 4:12b, 16c). The building up of the Body of Christ is entirely a matter of our growth. If we do not grow, there can be no building. If we all grow, there will be much building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. By Being Perfected</H2><P>We grow unto the building up of the Body by being perfected (Eph. 4:12a). This is why we need to have the small group meetings: to carry out the mutual perfecting of all the saints as members of Christ's Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. By Being Joined Together and Knit Together<br>through Every Joint of the Rich Supply and<br>through the Operation in the Measure of Each One Part</H2><P>We grow unto the building up of the Body also by being joined together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part (Eph. 4:16). The word joined implies the thought of being joined by fitting, and the word knit implies the thought of interweaving. In the Body we are not only joined together but also knit together. The Body is built up through the rich supply of every joint and through the operation in the measure of each one part. The joints are the specially gifted members of the Body, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (v. 11). The parts are all the members of the Body. Through these two kinds of members the entire Body is joined together and knit together for the building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. In Love</H2><P>The Body builds up itself in love. This is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body. We must love one another with the divine love for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Its Ultimate Consummation</H2><P>Like the writings of John and Peter, the writings of Paul also reveal the ultimate consummation of the believers' growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Be Transfigured in the Body<br>in the Completion of the Full Redemption</H2><P>Our growth in life will consummate ultimately in our being transfigured in the body in the completion of the full redemption (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23b). We have been redeemed in our spirit through regeneration, and now we are being redeemed in our soul through growth and transformation. Ultimately, we will be redeemed in our body through glorification. Hence, the redemption of our body is the consummation of the full redemption, which includes regeneration, transformation, and glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Glorified with the Glory of God<br>in the Corporate Expression of the New Jerusalem</H2><P>In the ultimate consummation of the believers' growth in life, the believers will be glorified with the glory of God in the corporate expression of the New Jerusalem (Rom. 8:30c; Rev. 21:2, 10-11). The New Jerusalem is the final, ultimate sign in God's economy (Rev. 1:1 and the first paragraph of note 12), and the final, ultimate goal of all God's redeemed people (Heb. 11:10, 16; 12:22; Gal. 4:26). As such a great sign in God's economy, the New Jerusalem signifies all God's redeemed, justified, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, transfigured, and glorified people. All the aspects of the New Jerusalem need our growth and transformation. Therefore, by His mercy and grace I would urge you to do your best to grow in Christ and to be transformed in His life by the Spirit. Then He will have a way to build up His Body today to consummate in the upcoming New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>BY THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a; 8:30c; Heb. 2:10a; Titus 3:5b</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The complete salvation of God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Sanctification in God's calling&#151;1 Pet. 1:2b.</li>	<li>The redemption of Christ&#151;Rom. 3:24b.</li>	<li>Washing of our sins by the blood of Christ&#151;Rev. 1:5b; 1 Pet. 1:2c; 1 John 1:7.</li>	<li>Forgiveness of sins&#151;Acts 2:38.</li>	<li>Objective justification by God&#151;Rom. 3:24a.</li>	<li>Reconciliation to God&#151;Rom. 5:10a.</li>	<li>Objective sanctification by the blood of Christ&#151;Heb. 10:29b.</li>	<li>Regeneration by the Spirit&#151;Titus 3:5b.</li>	<li>Full salvation of God&#151;Acts 16:31.</li>	<li>Daily salvation in the life of Christ&#151;Rom. 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:2.</li>	<li>Washing by the Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 6:11a.</li>	<li>Anointing of the Spirit&#151;1 John 2:20, 27.</li>	<li>Subjective sanctification in the Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 6:11b; Rom. 15:16b; 6:19b, 22b.</li>	<li>Subjective justification in the Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 6:11c.</li>	<li>God abiding in us&#151;1 John 3:24; 4:13.</li>	<li>Christ making His home in our hearts&#151;Eph. 3:17.</li>	<li>The renewing of the Holy Spirit&#151;Titus 3:5c; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 12:2a.</li>	<li>Transformation from the Lord Spirit&#151;2 Cor. 3:18b; Rom. 12:2b.</li>	<li>Conformation to the image of the Lord&#151;Rom. 8:29a.</li>	<li>Redemption of the body&#151;Rom. 8:23b; Eph. 1:14b; 4:30b.</li>	<li>Glorification in the glory of God&#151;Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10.</li>	</ol><li>The vital importance of transformation in the complete salvation of God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Of the twenty-one aspects listed above, regeneration, transformation, and glorification are the three vital aspects in God's complete salvation:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Regeneration brings the divine life into the believers to germinate and generate their spirit&#151;John 3:5-6.</li>		<li>Transformation carries the divine essence into all the components of the believers' soul&#151;mind, emotion, and will&#151;to transform them metabolically&#151;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a.</li>		<li>Glorification saturates the believers' body with the glory of God to glorify them by bringing them into God's glory&#151;Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10a.</li>		<li>Regeneration transpires in the believers' spirit at the moment when they receive Christ as their Redeemer, Savior, and life once for all; transformation is taking place in the believers' soul for their entire Christian life until they will be transfigured and glorified in their body; and glorification will be consummated at the Lord's rapture once for all when He comes to meet them.</li>		</ol>	<li>All three aspects are organic and by these three steps the believers' entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;will be organically mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>	</ol><li>The significance of transformation:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not merely an outward change.</li>	<li>An inward transformation in nature and essence.</li>	<li>The move of the divine life in the believers' inner being.</li>	<li>The positive organic reaction of the divine life in the believers' entire being.</li>	<li>The metabolic constitution in the believers' renewed being.</li>	<li>The expression of the divine image's attributes in the believers' renewed being to be the virtues of the believers' new man.</li>	<li>The manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers' new man.</li>	<li>The masterpiece of the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the Lord Spirit throughout the believers' entire being as the new creation by His renewing work&#151;2 Cor. 3:18b; Titus 3:5b.</li>	<li>Accomplished in the believers who, with unveiled face, behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord&#151;2 Cor. 3:18a.</li>	<li>Issuing in the glorious image of the glorified Lord from one degree of His glory to another until the believers enter into His glory to be glorified by the bright splendor of God's glory&#151;2 Cor. 3:18b; Heb. 2:10a; Rom. 8:30c.</li>	</ol></ol><P>The first two chapters of this book speak of the constitution of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ has come into existence through the constitution with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element, but God has an enemy who is not happy to see this. We have seen in Matthew 13 that God's enemy followed Christ as the Sower. Wherever Christ sows, there Satan is. In the second chapter of this book we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption. In spite of all the negative steps taken by the enemy, Christ as the almighty One, the centrality and universality of God's economy, still has finished His work for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy. Now in the whole universe, there is the reality of the Body of Christ. Although the enemy has leavened the church with Catholicism and Protestantism, there is still the Body of Christ in this universe even though the ones who realize this Body are relatively few in number. By His grace and mercy, we are seeking to see this Body be fully constituted with Christ, transformed, and built up.</P><P>After our fellowship on the constitution of the Body of Christ, we went on in chapters three and four to see the building up of the Body of Christ by the growth in life. Without our growing up in Christ, in His life, there is no possibility, no way, that the Body of Christ can be built up. In chapter three we saw the believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John. Then in chapter four we saw our growth in life unveiled in the writings of Peter and Paul. We saw that the base of our growth in life in Peter's writings is of the following items: the sanctification of the Spirit, the redemption of Christ, the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, the regeneration through His resurrection, the God-allotted faith, the divine power that gives us all things related to life and godliness, the precious and exceedingly great promises, and the divine nature. The entire New Testament is a book of promises. I covered these great items, but it is difficult to cover these items and all the other items in the outlines in detail. I would encourage you to study all the items of the outlines at the beginning of each chapter of this book. Actually, the six chapters of this book cover the entire New Testament.</P><P>Now we come to our burden in the last two chapters. The stress in these chapters is on the building up of the Body of Christ by the transformation in the divine life. We have seen that this divine life has gone through a long process. This life has gone through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human life on this earth, through an all-inclusive death, through a wonderful, marvelous resurrection, and this life has entered into the highest peak of ascension. This divine life today is not as it was before incarnation, but it is after ascension. Before incarnation Christ was only divine, not human. He did not have a human body with flesh and blood. But through incarnation He picked up human flesh and blood. He put on a human body and became one with humanity in incarnation.</P><P>While Christ was walking and living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He saw and gained a lot. He picked up the poverty of the fallen race (2 Cor. 8:9). No doubt, He picked up a consideration, a pity, and a compassion for the human race. Then He entered into death, into the tomb, and into Hades, where He stayed for three days. He visited and took a tour of Hades, and then He walked out of Hades and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). He always was the only begotten Son of God, but with His humanity He was born in His resurrection to be God's firstborn Son, to be our model so that we all could be God's many sons. Also, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</P><P>After His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples through a period of forty days (Acts 1:3). After these forty days, He went to Mount Olivet and ascended into heaven (vv. 9-12a). He ascended to the Father, and in ascension He was made the Lord and Christ (2:36). Today He is God and He is man, having both divinity and humanity. His human living, the effectiveness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and the height of His ascension are now in Him as life. It is in this life that we are now being transformed for the building up of the Body of Christ. The ingredients of this life are unsearchably rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD</H2><P>In order to see the revelation of the transformation in life for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to see the items of the complete salvation of God. These twenty-one items are as follows:</P><ul class="none"><li>1) Sanctification in God's calling (1 Pet. 1:2b).</li><li>2) The redemption of Christ (Rom. 3:24b).</li><li>3) Washing of our sins by the blood of Christ (Rev. 1:5b; 1 Pet. 1:2c; 1 John 1:7).</li><li>4) Forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38).</li><li>5) Objective justification by God (Rom. 3:24a).</li><li>6) Reconciliation to God (Rom. 5:10a).</li><li>7) Objective sanctification by the blood of Christ (Heb. 10:29b).</li><li>8) Regeneration by the Spirit (Titus 3:5b).</li><li>9) Full salvation of God (Acts 16:31).</li><li>10) Daily salvation in the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:2).</li><li>11) Washing by the Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11a).</li><li>12) Anointing of the Spirit (1 John 2:20, 27).</li><li>13) Subjective sanctification in the Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11b; Rom. 15:16b; 6:19b, 22b.</li><li>14) Subjective justification in the Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11c).</li><li>15) God abiding in us (1 John 3:24; 4:13).</li><li>16) Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17).</li><li>17) The renewing of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5c; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 12:2a).</li><li>18) Transformation from the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18b; Rom. 12:2b).</li><li>19) Conformation to the image of the Lord (Rom. 8:29a).</li><li>20) Redemption of the body (Rom. 8:23b; Eph. 1:14b; 4:30b).</li><li>21) Glorification in the glory of God (Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10).</li></ul><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF TRANSFORMATION<br>IN THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD</H2><P>Now we need to see the vital importance of transformation in the complete salvation of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Regeneration, Transformation, and Glorification Being the Three Vital Aspects<br>in God's Complete Salvation</H2><P>Of the twenty-one aspects listed above, regeneration, transformation, and glorification are the three vital aspects in God's complete salvation. Regeneration is the start of our spiritual Christian life and glorification is the consummation, the ending, of our Christian life. In between there is a long period of time, and this period of time is filled up with transformation. Both regeneration and glorification transpire in an instant, but transformation is a process that lasts through our entire Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Regeneration Bringing<br>the Divine Life into the Believers<br>to Germinate and Generate Their Spirit</H2><P>Regeneration brings the divine life into the believers to germinate and generate their spirit (John 3:5-6). Through regeneration we were reborn to be God's children with God's life (1 John 5:12) and nature (2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Transformation Carrying the Divine Essence into All the Components of the Believers' Soul</H2><P>Transformation carries the divine essence into all the components of the believers' soul&#151;mind, emotion, and will&#151;to transform them metabolically (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a). The essence is the very intrinsic reality of a certain substance. Transformation brings the divine essence into our being. This process of transformation will continue until our bodies are transfigured (Phil. 3:21). In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit, now is transforming our soul, and consummately will transfigure our body, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Glorification Saturating the Believers' Body with the Glory of God</H2><P>Glorification saturates the believers' body with the glory of God to glorify them by bringing them into God's glory (Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10a). We need to remember these three vital items in God's full salvation: regeneration, transformation, and glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Regeneration Transpiring in the Believers' Spirit, Transformation Taking Place in<br>the Believers' Soul, and Glorification Being Consummated at the Lord's Rapture</H2><P>Regeneration transpires in the believers' spirit at the moment they receive Christ as their Redeemer, Savior, and life once for all; transformation is taking place in the believers' soul for their entire Christian life until they will be transfigured and glorified in their body; and glorification will be consummated at the Lord's rapture once for all when He comes to meet them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By These Three Steps the Believers'<br>Entire Being Will Be Organically Mingled<br>with the Processed and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>All three aspects are organic and by these three steps the believers' entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;will be organically mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSFORMATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Merely an Outward Change</H2><P>Transformation is not merely an outward change. When I came to the United States in 1962, I began to stress in my messages the truth concerning the human spirit for us to contact God and to enjoy Christ. The second thing I stressed was the all-inclusive Christ with the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. The third thing I stressed was transformation. In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the King James Version uses the word changed instead of the word transformed. But this is an inadequate translation, because the Greek word here means transformed. We need to see that transformation is not a mere outward change.</P><P>In order to explain what transformation is, let us consider the example of a healthy person. The healthy color in this person's face is not from applying cosmetics to his skin. The application of cosmetics is a mere outward change by outward makeup. The way to have a healthy appearance is by eating healthy food. The healthy food metabolically makes us healthy, giving us a healthy appearance outwardly. In order to grow in life and have the transformation in life, we need to eat Christ as our healthy, spiritual food. When we eat, digest, and assimilate Christ as our spiritual food, the essence of this food gets into our being and produces transformation. Many Christians today are weak because they do not eat Jesus. If we eat Jesus every day, we will be spiritually energetic and will be transformed in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. An Inward Transformation<br>in Nature and Essence</H2><P>Transformation is not merely an outward change, but an inward transformation in nature and essence. It is an inward, metabolic change. For us to have a metabolic change we need a new element added into us. Then the new element replaces the discharged old element, and we have an inward, metabolic change in nature and in essence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Move of the Divine Life<br>in the Believers' Inner Being</H2><P>Transformation is the issue of the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being. This is very intrinsic. Every living thing moves. The move of life within us is the result of our eating. Whatever we eat is digested and assimilated into our cells. This digestion and assimilation is what I call the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being. When we eat and drink Christ, He becomes the new element within us to replace and discharge the old things within us. The divine essence comes into us to replace the fallen human element, causing us to be transformed metabolically and inwardly.</P><P>After you have been saved, you have the desire to live a life like Jesus. Thus, when you lose your temper, you are full of regret and ask the Lord to forgive you. Then you may pray, "Lord, You know I am weak. I have no way to deal with my temper. You must come in to deal with it." But when your temper rises up again, you do not allow Jesus to deal with it. You try to deal with it yourself, and you are defeated. Instead of trying to deal with your temper, you have to realize that the divine life is in you. This is basic. We all have Jesus' life within us, and this life is divine, living, moving, organic, and very energetic. While this life moves, lives, and works, it will deal with your temper.</P><P>The apostle Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20a). We need to say, "I can do nothing and I don't want to do anything. I have been crucified. It is no longer I dealing with or being concerned for my temper, but it is Christ who lives in me." Do not forget that you have another life, the divine life, and this life is stronger than your first life. When your temper is rising up, just say, "O Lord Jesus." Do not try to do anything. Just wait, and let Him do it. Whenever He does something, He will cause you to go along with Him. This secret is not known to most Christians, and this secret is very fine. When an occasion comes to cause you to lose your temper, do everything slowly. If your wife is tempting you to lose your temper, it is best not to do anything. Remember that you have been crucified, and that it is no longer you, but Christ who lives in you. Then He will begin to take care of your temper, not just by Himself but with you. He will cause you to walk with Him so naturally, and your temper will go away.</P><P>Another weakness we have is that we like to talk about others. Mostly we like to talk about others in a critical way. We may regret this and confess our sin to the Lord. Then we may say, "Lord, help me never to do this again." But the Lord does not hear this kind of prayer. We should not try in and by ourselves to overcome our temper and our criticism of others. This is wrong.</P><P>Instead, morning by morning and day by day, we should enjoy Christ, realizing that it is "no longer I but Christ who lives in me." We have been regenerated, and we have another One living in us and with us. Thus, we do not need to do anything. We do not need to be concerned and anxious for so many things, because everything is in His hand. He is in us, and He takes care of us. We do not need to do anything regarding our temper. Instead, we should just say, "I am crucified with Christ, and it is no more I, but Christ who lives in me." In great things and in small things, we should always let Him live in us and through us.</P><P>On certain occasions, we may be angry with someone and we may want to go to speak to him, but the Lord would say, "If you go, I am not going with you." We should respond by saying, "Lord, if You don't go, I will not go." This is what it means to live Christ. The way to have the victory is to live Christ. In everything, we should not act. Instead, we should allow Him to act because His living is our victory. Whenever we live Christ, He as the divine life is adding Himself into us. Then we are metabolically renewed with the new element of the divine life, the resurrection life. The new element of the divine life comes in to replace our old and fallen element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Positive Organic Reaction of the Divine Life<br>in the Believers' Entire Being</H2><P>The inward transformation in our nature and essence is the result of the positive organic reaction of the divine life in our entire being. Within us there is the divine life, and with the divine life there is always some positive, organic, and living reaction. We have a living reaction within us because we have the divine life in us. This reaction of the divine life in our entire being preserves us. We must allow the Lord Jesus to occupy our entire being&#151;our mind, emotion, and will&#151;for our transformation in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Metabolic Constitution<br>in the Believers' Renewed Being</H2><P>Every day the Lord is renewing us, and His renewing is a kind of metabolism to supply us with His new element to replace our old element. This issues in a metabolic constitution in our renewed being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Expression of the Divine Image's Attributes<br>in the Believers' Renewed Being<br>to Be the Virtues of the Believers' New Man</H2><P>In transformation there is the expression of the divine image's attributes in the believers' renewed being to be the virtues of the believers' new man. God is real, living, and present. He has an image and His image has many attributes. When these attributes are expressed within us, they become our virtues. For this to happen, we should not do anything by ourselves or for ourselves. Instead, we should let Him do everything with us and for us. Then He is the divine life within us, moving, living, and working in every part of our being to make our being a renewed being. Then all the divine attributes will be expressed through our virtues. Actually His attributes, such as His love, His kindness, His humility, and His gentleness, become our virtues. We then become persons not living by ourselves but by Him as our new element, causing us to become a new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Manifestation of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God<br>in the Believers' New Man</H2><P>Transformation results in the manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers' new man. Through our transformation the Triune God will be expressed in us. This Triune God is the One who has been processed and consummated, the One who has humanity and who knows what human suffering is. He lives in us, making us just like Him. Eventually, we will fully express Him as the God of love, the God of incarnation, and the God with the elements of humanity and human living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Masterpiece of the Consummated Spirit<br>of the Triune God as the Lord Spirit<br>throughout the Believers' Entire Being<br>as the New Creation by His Renewing Work</H2><P>Eventually, we believers become the masterpiece of the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the Lord Spirit throughout our entire being as the new creation by His renewing work (2 Cor. 3:18; Titus 3:5b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Accomplished in the Believers Who,<br>with Unveiled Face, Behold and Reflect<br>as a Mirror the Glory of the Lord</H2><P>Transformation is accomplished in the believers who, with unveiled face, behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord (2 Cor. 3:18a). We are like mirrors beholding and reflecting Christ. When the mirror looks at Christ, the mirror reflects Christ. Then people see Christ in us because He is expressed in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Issuing in the Glorious Image<br>of the Glorified Lord</H2><P>Our beholding and reflecting Christ eventually issues in the glorious image of the glorified Lord, as we are being transformed from one degree of His glory to another until we enter into His glory to be glorified by the bright splendor of God's glory (2 Cor. 3:18b; Heb. 2:10a; Rom. 8:30c).</P><P>Through regeneration, transformation, and glorification, we will be made absolutely the same as He is. The only thing in which we will be different from Him is His Godhead. We can never share in His Godhead. Only He is God. But we can be exactly the same as He is in His life, in His nature, in His image, in His expression, and in His attributes. In everything we will be the same as He is, but not in His Godhead. He is the unique God for people's worship. We are just His duplication, continuation, and multiplication to express Him through transformation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>BY THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:44-46; 1 Cor. 3:12; John 17:26b; Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9; Rev. 21:1-3, 9-23</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="4"><li>The consummation of the transformation in the building up of the Body of Christ:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Constituting the believers, who grow and mature in Christ's life, into precious materials for the building of God&#151;Matt. 13:44-46; 1 Cor. 3:12:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Supplying the believers with the element of the all-inclusive Christ.</li>		<li>Applying the cross of Christ to the believers' peculiarity, individuality, independence, seclusion, self-deception, pretension, self-seeking, personal preference and taste, localism in church practice, and all kinds of divisive factors.</li>		<li>Supporting the believers with the power of Christ's resurrection in long-suffering, in the uniting bond of peace, and in all the positive needs for joining together and knitting together and for the rich supply of every joint and the operation in measure of each one part.</li>		</ol>	<li>Issuing in the practical building of God:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Locally in every local church in the harmony of the one accord stimulated by the one Spirit in the one Body of Christ.</li>		<li>Universally in the oneness of the Divine Trinity, prayed for by the Lord (John 17) and accomplished by His lovers (John 17:26b) for the carrying out of God's eternal economy according to His good pleasure (Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9).</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>The ultimate consummation of the transformation for the composition and constitution of the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21:1-3, 9-23:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Purely of the originating God:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In His divine nature.</li>		<li>Signified by the pure gold of the base of the city&#151;vv. 18b, 21b.</li>		</ol>	<li>Exclusively of the redeeming Christ:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the work of His all-inclusive death and His life-supplying resurrection.</li>		<li>Signified by the element of the pearls of the gates&#151;v. 21a:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The pearls signifying the regenerated believers.</li>			<li>Produced by Christ's death and resurrection.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>Absolutely of the consummating Spirit:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In His transformation work.</li>		<li>Signified by the essence of the precious stones of the wall and its foundations&#151;vv. 11, 18a, 19-20:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The precious stones signifying the transformed believers&#151;1 Pet. 2:5a.</li>			<li>Renewed by the Spirit's transforming work&#151;Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2a.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>With the regenerated, transformed, and glorified human beings&#151;vv. 12b, 14b.</li>	<li>No dust of humanity.</li>	<li>No plant of the human life.</li>	<li>No leaven of the enemy&#151;Matt. 13:33; 1 Cor. 5:6-8.</li>	<li>As the pure, exclusive, and absolute expression in the corporate manifestation (v. 11) of the processed and consummated Triune God (vv. 22-23) mingled with the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite men for eternity.</li>	</ol></ol><P>My burden in these days is with this fellowship concerning the constitution and the building up of the Body of Christ. This book is a continuation of the burden in the two books we have published entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation and The Overcomers.</P><P>In the previous chapter, we saw the complete salvation of God, the vital importance of transformation in the complete salvation of God, and the significance of transformation. I hope that through the fellowship in this book, we will see a vision concerning God's economy. We have seen that God's economy is accomplished in us in three steps: regeneration, transformation, and glorification. In this chapter we want to see something further concerning the building up of the Body of Christ by the transformation in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSFORMATION<br>IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Now we want to see the consummation of the transformation in the building up of the Body of Christ. We need to pay attention to the words consummation and transformation, since they are not common but very particular. Transformation cannot be consummated at once, so it must have a process. At the end of the process of transformation, there will be a consummation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Constituting the Believers,<br>Who Grow and Mature in Christ's Life,<br>into Precious Materials for the Building of God</H2><P>This transformation in its consummation, constitutes the believers, who grow and mature in Christ's life, into precious materials for the building of God (Matt. 13:44-46; 1 Cor. 3:12). Constituting is also a particular word. A physical building is not built by constitution but by pieces of material being added and joined together. With a physical building nothing is organic; it does not depend upon growth. A tree, however, is something organic which grows. It is not built up by the addition of materials. A tree can only grow up, and that growing up is a kind of constituting. The tree grows by taking in some life element. We may fertilize, water, and trim the tree, but it grows by itself according to its constitution with the life element. How can a small green sprout eventually become a tall tree? It becomes such a tall tree by being constituted with the life element, which causes it to grow.</P><P>The essence of the seed of the tree spontaneously mingles itself with the earth, not the whole earth, but just the essence of the earth. The essence of the earth with the essence of the seed grow together, and these two essences are the very materials for the constituting of this tree. This picture is very meaningful. When the Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the life seed into our heart as the soil, as the earth, the seed began to grow. Christ as the divine life seed and the believers as the human growing earth become one to produce the organic element for the constitution of the church (Eph. 1:22).</P><P>The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God's farm, God's cultivated land (v. 9), to grow Christ. This concept fits in with the Lord's word in Matthew 13. He said that He sowed Himself as the seed and that we are the earth. When the essence of the seed and the essence of the earth come together and are mingled together, some constituting work is going on. Then we grow up to become "Christ-trees."</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul told us not only that we are God's farm to grow Christ but also that we are God's building (v. 9). God's building is not of the plant life but is solely of minerals. Look at the New Jerusalem. What will be there? The New Jerusalem is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). The city has twelve foundations and these foundations are twelve layers of precious stones (vv. 14, 19-20). Furthermore, the first foundation is jasper (v. 19), the wall of the city is jasper (v. 18), and the light of the entire city is like a jasper stone (v. 11). God's appearance is like jasper (4:3), so the entire New Jerusalem bears the appearance of God and expresses God by her shining. God sitting on the throne looks like jasper, and we, the entire city, bear His appearance, so we are His enlargement. The New Jerusalem also has twelve pearls as its twelve gates (21:21), and the city itself is pure gold (v. 18). Nothing in the New Jerusalem can be burned because it is not of the plant life but it is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones.</P><P>The Bible first uses plants to illustrate the believers in Christ. The seed sown into the earth grows, but by itself it cannot grow. It needs some essence from the earth to match its essence. These two essences then grow together to enlarge the seed into a tree. This is a picture of our growth in life. While we are growing in life, we are also being transformed in life. Petrified wood is a good illustration of plant life which has been transformed into stone. Precious stones are actually transformed materials produced through tremendous heat and pressure.</P><P>When we were saved, we were like green, tender sprouts, but gradually we will become precious stones through being transformed. The garden of Eden, at the beginning of the Bible, eventually becomes a city, at the end of the Bible. We are on the way from being a garden to being a city through the process of transformation. This way is a long way, and this long way is actually Christ Himself. Christ told us that He is the way (John 14:6a). When we received Christ, we became one with Him. Then we began to follow Him and He became our way. Today we are still on the way, and our destination or our destiny is the New Jerusalem. This is the divine revelation in the Bible. Today we are still mostly plants, but we are being transformed into precious stones for God's building. How much the church has been built up all depends upon how much we grow. While we are growing, we are being transformed from plants into minerals, that is, into precious stones for God's building. This is the clear vision in the Bible.</P><P>In Matthew 13 there are seven parables. The first four parables are concerning the plant life. The first parable is concerning the sower coming out to sow (vv. 1-23); the second is concerning the enemy coming to sow the tares (vv. 24-30, 36-43); the third is concerning the mustard seed (vv. 31-32); and the fourth is concerning the woman taking the leaven and putting it into the fine flour made of the wheat (vv. 33-35). All these four parables are concerning the plant life. If we just remain in the plant stage, we will have trouble. We will be troubled by the wayside, the birds, the hidden rocks, and the thorns, signifying the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches. We will also be troubled by the mustard seed being changed in its nature into a big tree and by all kinds of leaven.</P><P>All kinds of "isms," such as Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, socialism, nationalism, racialism, and liberalism, are different kinds of leaven. A number of years ago, a medical doctor told me that we should set up some hospitals. This is liberalism. Another person came to me and said that the church in his locality was thinking about opening a school and using the church meeting hall for this purpose. We need to realize that if we get in the realm of setting up hospitals or schools, we will have all kinds of troubles, and all kinds of germs will creep into the church life. I saw this happen in mainland China. The missionaries set up hospitals and schools, and these became a part of the big tree with big branches, good for lodging the birds. The thought of having hospitals or schools is something of liberalism. This is why the Lord said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life (Matt. 7:14). We need to beware of any kind of leaven such as liberal thinking coming into the church life. A little leaven leavens and corrupts the whole lump, the whole church (1 Cor. 5:6).</P><P>The fifth and sixth parables in Matthew 13 do not speak concerning the plant life. The fifth parable is concerning the treasure (v. 44) and the sixth is concerning the pearl (vv. 45-46). Can you leaven a treasure? A large diamond could never be leavened. Can you leaven a pearl? Even if you bury the pearl with leaven, the pearl can never be leavened.</P><P>Matthew 13 shows us that while the Lord is working, His enemy is also working. When we remain in the stage of the plant life, we can easily get germs. But when we are transformed from the plants to the precious treasures and even become the New Jerusalem, there will be no possibility of our getting any germs. By that time we will all have been transformed into precious stones, which the enemy has no way to leaven.</P><P>We need to be on guard against any kind of leaven coming into the church life. Some in the church life may desire to be in a certain position. This is the leaven of ambition. Our opinions are another kind of leaven which can corrupt the church life. If no one takes our opinion, we may be offended. Opinions and the ambition for position or rank kill the church life. These things can be among us because we are still fleshly, natural, and in the old creation.</P><P>Many years ago I observed one brother who was seeking to be in the eldership. He thought he should be one of the elders, but he never became an elder. Because of his unfulfilled ambition, he gave up the church life and set up a meeting in his home. He also hired a preacher to be his home pastor. Eventually, from that division which he set up, some negative writings were put out which defamed Brother Watchman Nee. This is an illustration of the leaven of ambition. Today there are all kinds of leaven, but one day we will be in the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is impossible to be leavened.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Supplying the Believers<br>with the Element of the All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>Through transformation we are being constituted with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element. We are also being supplied with the element of the all-inclusive Christ. We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ, the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 2:9; Rev. 2:7; 22:2). After God created the heavens, the earth, and man, God put man before a tree called the tree of life. Man was created by God in God's image and after God's likeness (Gen. 1:26), but this man did not have God's life. Thus, we see a tree signifying God as life and a man who did not have God's life.</P><P>God said that every tree in the garden was pleasant to the sight and good for food, including the tree of life (2:9). God's desire is to mingle Himself with man, and the way for man to be mingled with Him is by eating. In God's wisdom, He made Himself eatable (John 6:57). Many Christians have never heard that God is eatable. How could Adam be mingled with that life tree? How could that life tree get into Adam? The only way was by Adam's eating. It is interesting to note that God created man with a stomach. If we did not have a stomach, we would never feel hungry; we would never sense that we need to eat. In certain senses, our stomach can be troublesome to us. Many sicknesses and diseases come from the wrong kind of eating. But the tree of life is something that is altogether and purely good. If we eat this tree, we will get life and be healthy. By eating the tree of life (Rev. 2:7b), we can be mingled with God, and this mingling is the constitution.</P><P>Our physical body is being constituted with the life supply every day. When food is added into our stomach, the constituting work is going on. Then we are growing up in life. In this constituting process, there is a kind of transformation. In the morning we eat breakfast, and during the day what we have eaten is being digested and assimilated into our being. The life element is constituting our being. The food we eat does a constituting work within us. This is a picture of our Christian life. We need to eat Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life (John 6:57b-58a, 51, 68), as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7b), and as the hidden manna (v. 17b). By eating Christ we can be constituted and supplied with Him as our life element so that we can grow in life and be transformed in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Applying the Cross of Christ</H2><P>In order to be transformed, we need to apply the cross of Christ to our peculiarity, individuality, independence, seclusion, self-deception, pretension, self-seeking, personal preference and taste, localism in church practice, and all kinds of divisive factors.</P><P>The cross of Christ needs to be applied to all of our peculiar traits. When I entered into the ministry with Brother Nee in 1933, he told me that there was a brother among us who had a certain peculiar trait. Whatever you asked him to do, he would do the opposite. If you asked him to go to the east, he would go to the west. Thus, if you wanted him to go to the east, you had to tell him to go to the west. The divorces and separations between husbands and wives today are mostly due to their peculiarities. In order to have the one accord in the church life, all of our peculiarities must be dealt with by the cross.</P><P>We also need to apply the cross to any localism in church practice. Some may have the attitude that their local church is independent and autonomous and should not be interfered with. This is localism. An independent local church is actually a local sect. We need to deal with any localism in church practice and with all kinds of divisive factors.</P><P>We may know something about Christ's Body, but if we do not accept the cross to crucify our natural life, to break us, and to consume us, and if we do not know the cross, we will always have problems. The co-workers and the elders need to apply the cross in their fellowship with one another. Instead of having a thorough fellowship with one another, they may like to keep things secret. Sometimes we call a meeting for the co-workers to come together to fellowship about the Lord's work, but in the meeting they say very little. Their policy is that the more you say, the more mistakes you make, and the less you say, the less mistakes you make. Anything concerning the work, however, should be fellowshipped among the co-workers. Surely if we are too open, we can cause trouble. But if we do not have open fellowship with one another and if we keep secrets, anything of the Lord which is under our hand will be killed.</P><P>The co-workers and elders must learn not to conceal or hide things from one another. The elders and the co-workers need to come together, to pray together, to open to one another, and to discuss the needs and problems in the church in a frank and open way. This is the best way to get things solved. To conceal things and to think that we have the way to take care of them without fellowship is wrong. We need to apply the cross to our individuality and independence.</P><P>We also need to apply the cross to our personal preference and taste. We have our taste and our choice, which are damaging to the one accord. We need to receive the supply of Christ, and we also have to receive His cross all the time. Eventually, we have to realize that everyone and everything is a cross to us. Our relatives, our children, the saints, and our close co-workers all become the cross to put us to death. This is our destiny. The Lord Jesus is the "cross-giver," who assigns all kinds of crosses to us. Only the Lord knows the right one for us to marry. The Lord's intention actually is not to give us a spouse. The Lord's intention is to give us the cross. The single sisters may have the desire to get the best husband, someone who is a hero, who is very capable, and who has the highest education. But eventually, such a husband, instead of being a hero, may become like a "Pharaoh" to them. Their intention is to get the best husband, but the Lord's intention is to give them the cross. We all need to realize that the cross of Christ goes along with the supply of Christ. Without the supply, we cannot bear the cross. But without the cross, the Lord's supply is merely terminology to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Supporting the Believers<br>with the Power of Christ's Resurrection</H2><P>The believers are supported with the power of Christ's resurrection in long-suffering, in the uniting bond of peace, and in all the positive needs for joining together and knitting together and for the rich supply of every joint and the operation in measure of each one part. This means that in the church life, we have to be one. You have to be joined to me and I have to be joined to you. In the Lord's recovery, all of the races with all the different colors&#151;white, black, yellow, brown, and red&#151;are blended together. The peoples of this earth are all so different. How could all these peoples be one Body? There is one Body in the universe, and we express it here on earth for all to see (see chorus of Hymns, #1107). We do not want people to see divisions or opinions. This is why we need to be joined together and knit together.</P><P>The only way we can be really one is by the application of the cross and the power of Christ's resurrection. His power of resurrection is sufficient for us. He gives us the cross to bear, but He also supports us with the power of His resurrection. It is in this way that we are transformed. Paul said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death (Phil. 3:10). We should live and serve not by our natural power, but by the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing in the Practical Building of God</H2><P>The constituting of the believers into precious materials through transformation issues in the practical building of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Locally in Every Local Church</H2><P>The practical building of God is locally in every local church in the harmony of the one accord stimulated by the one Spirit in the one Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Universally in the Oneness of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>This practical building is also universally in the oneness of the Divine Trinity, prayed for by the Lord (John 17) and accomplished by His lovers (John 17:26b) for the carrying out of God's eternal economy according to His good pleasure (Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9). There is the possibility of having the one accord in the local church and of enjoying the oneness universally in the Body of Christ. This all depends upon how much we love the Lord, how much we receive the Lord, how much we love His cross, and how much we live not by our energy, power, strength, and might, but by the power of His resurrection. The death of His cross and the power of His resurrection both are compounded in the compound Spirit (cf. Exo. 30:23-25). When we live by the Spirit and follow the Spirit, we have the cross and the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE TRANSFORMATION FOR THE COMPOSITION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>Now we want to see the ultimate consummation of the transformation for the composition and constitution of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-23). The conclusion of the sixty-six books of the Bible is a divine building, the New Jerusalem. This building is a gold mountain, constituted with precious stones and twelve gates of pearl. This is the issue, the consummation, of the entire revelation of the whole Bible. Surely this must be very meaningful. This is why we purposely wrote a number of hymns related to and concerning the New Jerusalem when we were composing our hymnal (see Hymns, #971, 972, 975, 976, 978, 979, 980, 981, 984). I hope that we would learn to sing all these hymns.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Purely of the Originating God</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is purely of the originating God in His divine nature, signified by the pure gold of the base of the city (vv. 18b, 21b). The New Jerusalem is built on a gold mountain, and that gold is the base of the New Jerusalem. The city's being of pure gold signifies that the New Jerusalem is altogether of God's divine nature and takes God's divine nature as its element. All of us have God in His divine nature within us as a base according to our spiritual birth (2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exclusively of the Redeeming Christ</H2><P>The New Jerusalem in its composition and constitution is exclusively of the redeeming Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Work of His All-inclusive Death<br>and His Life-supplying Resurrection</H2><P>The holy city is exclusively of the redeeming Christ in the work of His all-inclusive death and His life-supplying resurrection. His death is all-inclusive to solve all the problems, and His resurrection is supplying us with life all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Signified by the Element of the Pearls of the Gates</H2><P>The work of the redeeming Christ in His overcoming death and life-supplying resurrection is signified by the element of the pearls of the gates (Rev. 21:21a). The pearls signify the regenerated believers produced by Christ's death and resurrection. Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us into precious pearls for the building of God's eternal expression.</P><P>The twelve gates of the city are twelve pearls, signifying that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This also indicates that Christ's death plus His resurrection will produce us to be the very entrance for people to come into the holy city. Today in the local churches there are some brothers who are like gates, through which people can enter into the realities of the holy city.</P><P>Paul said that we should build the church today with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12a). In the New Jerusalem there will be gold and precious stones but no silver. Silver is in the church today, but it will be replaced by pearl in the New Jerusalem. In 1 Corinthians 3 we have silver because in typology silver represents redemption. Redemption deals with sin. For eternity in the New Jerusalem sin will be banished and eliminated. Therefore, in eternity there will be no need for redemption, for silver. The need there is not for silver, for redemption, but for pearl, for regeneration. Redemption is to take away sin; regeneration is to bring in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Absolutely of the Consummating Spirit</H2><P>The composition and constitution of the New Jerusalem is absolutely of the consummated Spirit in His transformation work, signified by the essence of the precious stones of the wall and its foundations (Rev. 21:11, 18a, 19-20). These precious stones signify the transformed believers (1 Pet. 2:5a) renewed by the Spirit's transforming work (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. With the Regenerated, Transformed,<br>and Glorified Human Beings</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is purely of God the Father, exclusively of Christ, absolutely of the Spirit, and with the regenerated, transformed, and glorified human beings (Rev. 21:12b, 14b). We have been regenerated, we are on the way of transformation, and we will reach the goal of glorification. The Triune God will be fully mingled with us as transformed and glorified persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. No Dust of Humanity</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no dust of humanity. We were created by God of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). We are dusty persons, because we were made of dust. It is not a matter of whether we are good or bad but of whether we are dusty or transformed. The brothers may pretend to be gentlemen and the sisters to be ladies, but actually they are dusty. This is why the more we stay in the church life, the more we are exposed. When we first come into the church life, this is our church life "honeymoon." But after this honeymoon time in the church life, everything may become unpleasant, because all the dust comes out. Then everybody knows that we are dusty. We are neither good nor bad, but we are all dusty. But there will be no dust in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. No Plant of the Human Life</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no plant of the human life. There will just be gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the New Jerusalem there will be no plants or trees of the plant life to shade us, but Christ Himself will be our canopy in the New Jerusalem. This is clearly prophesied in the book of Isaiah (4:5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. No Leaven of the Enemy</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no leaven of the enemy (Matt. 13:33; 1 Cor. 5:6-8), because we will all be transformed into pearls and precious stones, which cannot be leavened. My burden is to show all the saints that if we mean business to keep the oneness for the Lord's recovery, we must learn to be transformed. We must not remain in the plant stage. We have to be transformed from dust into plants, and from plants into transformed, precious materials. Then there will be no leaven. When there is no leaven, everything will be pure, there will be no trouble, and the church will be built up in peace with the transformed saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. As the Pure, Exclusive, and Absolute Expression<br>in the Corporate Manifestation of the Processed and Consummated Triune God Mingled with<br>the Regenerated, Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Men for Eternity</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be the pure, exclusive, and absolute expression in the corporate manifestation (Rev. 21:11) of the processed and consummated Triune God (vv. 22-23) mingled with the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite men for eternity. We have to read and study the outlines with the verses in this book so that we can see how we should live and behave in the church life (cf. 1 Tim. 3:15). Then the church can be built up with the mature saints and even built up to the uttermost with the transformed saints.</P><P>We need to spend some time to read the Scripture references, the outlines, and the fellowship in this book with prayer. Then the Lord will have a way to lead us into a realization of the deeper significance of all these points.</P></body></html>
