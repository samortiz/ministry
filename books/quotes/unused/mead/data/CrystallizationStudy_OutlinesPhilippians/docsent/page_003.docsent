   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Three Taking Christ as Our Pattern Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-11 In order to experience Christ and live Christ, we must know Him as our pattern and take Him as our pattern: In 2:5-11 Paul presents Christ as the pattern; we need to have this pattern infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God: Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; He emptied Himself, laying aside what He possessed the form of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6-7a.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression from the form of God to the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord became in the likeness of men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7b-8a: The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He appeared to men as a man outwardly, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ entered into the condition of humanity, and He was found in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death the death of a cross v. 8b: Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ s self-humbling manifested His self-emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The death of a cross was the climax of Christ s humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name v. 9: God has exalted Jesus, a real man, to be the Lord of all Acts 2:32-33; 5:31.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This exaltation of Christ was the manifestation of resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The highest name in the universe, the greatest name, is the name of Jesus: 1 The name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 In the name of Jesus means in the sphere and element of all that the Lord is Phil 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result of our confessing that Jesus is Lord is that God the Father is glorified; this is the great end of all that Christ is and has done in His person and work v. 11; 1 Cor 15:24-28.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The principle of this pattern is that someone with the highest life and position would be willing to live in a lowly way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as our pattern is not only objective but also subjective and experiential Phil 2:5, 12-13: The One who set up the pattern and who Himself is the pattern is now operating within us as the indwelling God v. 13.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle of Christ as the inward pattern for our living is that even if we have the highest standard or the highest position, we should not grasp it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be partners with Christ in His human living, especially in His emptying and humbling Himself and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6-7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christ who is our pattern is now the life within us Col 3:4: We have a life in us that is a self-emptying and self-humbling life; this life never grasps at something as a treasure but is always willing to lay aside position and title.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have Christ crucified as our pattern, and this pattern is the crucified life within us Gal 2:20: The steps of Christ s humiliation in Philippians 2:5-8 are all aspects of the crucified life lived out in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life 1:21a.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Taking the crucified life as our pattern opens the gate of resurrection and brings us into the power of resurrection 3:10: By living a crucified life, we can experience the power of resurrection which exalted Christ to the highest peak in the universe Eph 1:19-22.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The highest life on earth is a crucified life; whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ should be exalted not only objectively in the universe but also subjectively in our daily life Phil 2:9: Christ is exalted in us as we take Him as the crucified life to be the pattern of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the power that exalts Christ 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would take Christ as our pattern, we need to take Christ s mind as our mind 2:5: Paul not only took Christ as his living and expression outwardly but also took the mind of Christ as his mind inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the mind of Christ to be in us means that this mind is something living; actually, the mind of Christ is Christ Himself, for the person of Christ is manifested in His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to open ourselves and let this mind be in us v. 5: This refers to the considering in verse 3 and to the regarding in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of thinking was in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>7-8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts 1:8.</S>
