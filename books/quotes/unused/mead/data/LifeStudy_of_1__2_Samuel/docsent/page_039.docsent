   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Samuel's Reminder</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 12:1-18 we have Samuel's reminder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This reminder implies a comparison between Samuel and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we compare Saul with Samuel, we will be able to see what is truly of God's heart and for God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of His Integrity</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, Samuel reminded Israel of his integrity that he was pure and just in dealing with the people vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He reminded them that he had not taken anything from them, defrauded them, oppressed them, or taken any bribe from them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said, "Jehovah is Witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand" v. 5a . Samuel's word implied that Saul would pervert justice and take away many things from the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Samuel had this kind of foresight concerning Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of Jehovah's Righteous Acts for Israel</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his wisdom, Samuel did not first speak about God to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, Samuel reminded the people of his integrity and then went on to speak to them of Jehovah's righteous acts for Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He reminded them that it was Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought their fathers up out of the land of Egypt v. 6 . Then he reminded them that Jehovah delivered them from the hand of their enemies all around v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of Israel's Wickedness in Asking for a King,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>though Jehovah Their God Was Their King</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, Samuel reminded Israel of their wickedness in asking for a king, though Jehovah their God was their King vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>12-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jehovah was their King, yet they wanted another king v. 12 . Here Samuel was rebuking Israel for leaving her Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because they wanted a king as a replacement for God, they would not have the proper enjoyment of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that, to some extent at least, Samuel's intent here was to provoke the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After Saul's conquest of the Ammonites, the people were happy, but they had been deceived by Saul, and Samuel was not happy about this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Samuel seemed to be saying to Israel, "You should have remained under the kingship of God, taking Him as your Husband and your Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you would have enjoyed a good life, for He would have had His kingdom among you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But you have done wrong in taking a man as your head instead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have actually divorced God and married Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You regard him as a handsome man, a man of choice, a man who is kind and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this is only his outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within him there is something dark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will cause you to suffer and will take away many things from you."</S>
