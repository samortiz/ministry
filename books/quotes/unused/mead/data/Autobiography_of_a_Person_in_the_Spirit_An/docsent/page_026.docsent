   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HUMBLE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's spirit was bold and yet it was also humble.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If your spirit is bold and yet not humble, that is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may kill all the brothers because you are so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Boldness needs the balance of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, you have to be bold; on the other hand, you have to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are either very bold or very humble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are bold we do not know what humility is, and when we are humble we do not know what boldness is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are like the unturned cake referred to in Hosea 7:8.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These characteristics of humility and boldness in our spirit are necessary for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes the sisters are keener than the brothers in noticing things that are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have this ability to see what is wrong and what is off, but most of the time they are not bold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They found out that something was wrong but they dared not tell the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They used the excuse that they are the weaker vessels 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be humble is proper, but sometimes the sisters have to exercise a bold spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was a certain sister who was a co-worker who saw certain mistakes that the brothers did not see, and she would come to us with boldness with tears on her face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She said, "Brothers, I have to fellowship with you because we are wrong in a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Though I am a sister under the covering, I have to say this."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times her fellowship became a deliverance from the Lord for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows us that we need a bold spirit with humility and a humble spirit with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A LOVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul spoke bold words, but his words were full of a loving spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul's spirit was a loving spirit, a spirit always stretching out to love others, to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not mean that we need a love which has its source in our emotions, but we need a loving spirit, a spirit within us that always loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason why I would be so frank to you in my spirit is because there is a lot of love in my spirit for you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a person says with his words may be very different from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Someone may say that he loves you, but by discerning his spirit you know that he really does not love you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, someone may tell you that he does not like you, but you realize that he loves you in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times mothers tell their children that they do not like them and they get upset with their children, but the children know that the mother loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person's words may be loving but his spirit is not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to learn to know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether I highly appraise you or say something to rebuke you, you have to discern my spirit not just my words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the building up of the church life, there is the need of such a loving spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A TENDER SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another characteristic of Paul's spirit is that his spirit was tender.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can speak boldly in words, yet still with a tender spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be dealt with by the working of the cross so that we can be a person with a tender spirit like the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A SPIRIT THAT IS NOT SELF-SEEKING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul's spirit was not self-seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second Corinthians shows us that he had a spirit that never sought anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He had a spirit fully, wholly, and thoroughly delivered out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever his spirit sought was for the good of the church and for the interest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a spirit is greatly needed in today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether or not the church in our place will be built up adequately depends upon our being a person with a spirit possessing all these characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we all would look to the Lord for His help in His grace to have the same spirit as the Apostle Paul, spontaneously the church life would be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need a spirit that does not seek anything for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A COORDINATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The final characteristic of Paul's spirit is that his spirit was always coordinating with others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our spirit might be tender, pure, and loving, yet not so cooperating or coordinating with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The verses in the Scripture reading show us that Paul's spirit was always coordinating with his co-workers, coordinating with the local churches, and even coordinating with those believers who did not treat him so well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was coordinating all the time, trying to be one with the saints, one with the local churches, and one with the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was so coordinating in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this chapter we have seen nine aspects of this man's spirit: his spirit was open, frank, pure, bold, humble, loving, tender, not self-seeking, but coordinating.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It would be helpful to pray-read all the verses in the Scripture reading with these nine points in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more you pray-read all these verses, the more you will see that these nine points are so significant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are the real characteristics of a person's spirit who lives in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need such a spirit for the building up of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without such a balanced, adjusted spirit, the church life could never be realized by you regardless of how many doctrines and how much knowledge you possess.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For us to realize the church life, we need such a balanced and adjusted spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May we all look to the Lord that we may have such a spirit.</S>
