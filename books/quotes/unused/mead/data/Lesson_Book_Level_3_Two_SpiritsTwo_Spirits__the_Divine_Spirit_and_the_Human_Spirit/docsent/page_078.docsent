   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to see the vision of the dispensing of the life of the Triune God into the three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we see this divine vision, our natural concept of ethics and morality will be shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to say to the Lord, "Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since You came into me, my spirit has become life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now if I set my mind on my spirit, my mind also will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord, how I praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through Your indwelling Spirit, Your zoe Greek, God's divine life life can be dispensed even into my mortal body.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the dispensation of the life of the Triune God into the tripartite man.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, it is by this dispensation that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the Christian life and the church life.</S>
