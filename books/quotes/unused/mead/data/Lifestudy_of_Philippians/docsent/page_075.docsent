   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GENUINE YOKEFELLOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:3 Paul uses the term yokefellow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In ancient times farmers used two oxen to pull a plow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term yokefellow thus refers to being yoked together with another to bear a common burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In writing to the Philippians, Paul was seeking a genuine yokefellow, one who would bear the same burden as he, under the same yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not seek Christ to the uttermost, we have not yet been yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, we are still quite free in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have truly been yoked, we shall think the same thing as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who had not been yoked together with Paul would not have been able to help him with Euodias and Syntyche.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul was burdened to help these sisters to think the same thing to pursue after Christ that they might gain Him and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But because Paul was in a Roman prison far away from Philippi, he needed someone there in Philippi to be yoked together with him to bear this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul expected that among the saints in Philippi there would be at least one who was the same as he was in pursuing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because Paul had been yoked, he had no freedom in his thought or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His mind had been yoked to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At any cost and by any means, Paul wanted to pursue Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, his mentality had been absolutely yoked by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from Christ, he had no liberty to think anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His mind had been fully yoked by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As he was writing to the Philippians, he was looking for at least one saint who could work together with him to help the two dissenting sisters to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was a very practical word with which to conclude this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In speaking of a genuine yokefellow, it seems as if Paul was saying, I have written you this Epistle, but I don t have the assurance that this letter will do the full job.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I need someone among you who is genuinely yoked under the same mind to seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a one will be able to help these sisters to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anyone who wants to help them must first be yoked under the same mind as I have.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have this mind and to think the same thing is to be a genuine yokefellow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today there is also the need for a genuine yokefellow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s ministry is hated and rejected by many.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may accept this ministry and even love it, but to love the ministry is one thing, and to be yoked under the mind to pursue Christ is another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to be yoked by having this mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Considering Paul s word about a genuine yokefellow should remind us not to read the Bible in a superficial way and not to take things for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul s expression genuine yokefellow may seem insignificant; actually it is extremely important, for it is related to his charge to the Philippian believers to have this mind, to think the same thing, even to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After issuing this charge, he mentions two sisters who were dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he goes on to urge someone to labor together with him as a genuine yokefellow to assist Euodias and Syntyche to think the same thing, to turn from their dissension and set their minds on the pursuing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE IMPORTANCE OF REJOICING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:4 Paul says, Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not the believers were dissenting, they all had to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who would not rejoice were wrong, but those who could rejoice were right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not believe, however, that dissenting ones can rejoice very much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Paul s word here, we should rejoice in the Lord always.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This rejoicing affords us the strength for the oneness spoken of in verses 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for Euodias and Syntyche to think the same thing, it was necessary for them to learn to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rejoicing in the Lord is also the secret of having the excellent characteristics listed in verses 5 through 9.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would have the virtues found in these verses, we need to rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To rejoice in the Lord is a very important matter.</S>
