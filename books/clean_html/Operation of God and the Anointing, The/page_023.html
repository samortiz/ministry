<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HAVING OUR MIND OPENED</h1>
<p>In Luke 24:13-35 the Lord Jesus appeared to two disciples after His resurrection. Verses 25 through 32 are a record of part of the conversation that the Lord had with the two disciples. The Lord Jesus &ldquo;said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory? And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther. And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to stay with them. And as He reclined at table with them, He took the loaf and blessed it, and having broken it, He began handing it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?&rdquo; The disciples did not recognize the Lord until their eyes were opened when He broke the bread. Later the Lord spoke with all the disciples. He &ldquo;said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day&rdquo; (vv. 44-46). At this time the mind of the disciples was opened to understand the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We will consider how our mind can be opened to grasp crucial spiritual matters related to life. Many saints do not know crucial spiritual matters, because their mind has not been opened. Although we have listened to messages for many years and have learned something concerning life, we have not entered into the experience of life. It seems as though we have not entered into the reality of the messages. It is doubtful whether many of us experience the divine life.</p>
<p>Some saints have spiritual experiences, but their experiences are fragmentary. For example, people who have not received formal education learn in fragments; they learn one word one day, another word another day, and another word after three or five days. This illustrates the spiritual experience of some saints. In order to receive a proper education, a person must attend school and progress step by step, beginning with elementary school. Similarly, spiritual lessons have a proper progression, but not many of us have progressed. Most saints love the Lord, but their knowledge and experience of spiritual matters are fragmentary. Few saints have crossed the threshold to properly learn spiritual lessons daily.</p>
<p>Certain events can be described as epoch-making. In our Christian life we need to have an &ldquo;epoch-making&rdquo; experience, a turning point. Before such an experience, we lived haphazardly in the Lord, but after such an experience, our life in the Lord will become regular, and we will learn spiritual lessons daily. We may have been zealous and loved the Lord in the past, but our spiritual experiences were fragmentary. Now we can be compared to those who are enrolled in school and are receiving a formal education. We need a turning point in our knowledge of spiritual things and in our experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>When my family first arrived in Taiwan, my youngest child did not understand what we were doing. When we got on the boat, she got on the boat. When we took a pedicab, she took a pedicab, but she did not understand anything. Now, however, she is very clear. She knows that she was born in Shanghai and that she resides in Taiwan. Formerly, she was in the dark, but now she is clear. How many among us can say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that I have crossed a threshold in my experience. I am now learning to live in You and to know You daily, not haphazardly but systematically.&rdquo; Such a turning point does not happen by exhortation or encouragement from others; rather, it requires our spiritual mind to be opened.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLES FOLLOWING THE LORD ZEALOUSLY,<br />
BUT THEIR MIND NOT BEING OPENED</h2>
<p>According to the record in Luke 24, the Lord appeared to the disciples in order to open their spiritual mind. Although the disciples followed the Lord Jesus before His resurrection, their spiritual mind was not opened. They were with the Lord daily; they lived with Him and went to different places with Him. We can say that they lived and walked together with the Lord. They also believed in the Lord and wanted the Lord, but their spiritual mind was not opened. The situation of many saints today is similar to that of the early disciples. Peter gave up being a fisherman in order to follow the Lord Jesus. It would be unfair to say that he was not saved or that he did not love the Lord. Nevertheless, his spiritual mind was not opened.</p>
<p>In chapter 24 when the Lord and the two disciples drew near to Emmaus, the two disciples constrained Him to stay with them. As the Lord reclined at table with them, He took the loaf, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them. Then &ldquo;their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?&rdquo; (vv. 31-32). The disciples&rsquo; words indicate that while the Lord was opening the Scriptures to them, their heart was burning within them, but their eyes were not opened. Hence, our heart being burning is one thing, but having our eyes enlightened is another thing.</p>
<p>Chapter 24 speaks of two openings. The first opening enabled the disciples to recognize Christ (v. 31), and the second opening enabled them to understand the Bible (v. 45). These two openings are actually one, because the Bible is a portrait of Christ. When our mind is opened to know the Bible, our eyes will be opened to know Christ. In verse 27 the Lord Jesus helped the disciples by explaining to them &ldquo;clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo; The Bible and Christ are one; the Bible is a record of Christ, and Christ is the living Word. Before the spiritual mind of the disciples was opened, their eyes did not recognize Christ, nor did they know the Scriptures. When their spiritual mind was opened, they had a turning point.</p>
