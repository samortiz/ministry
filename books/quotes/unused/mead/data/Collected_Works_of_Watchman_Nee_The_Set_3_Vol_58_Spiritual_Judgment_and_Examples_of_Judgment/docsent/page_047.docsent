   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 28 Date:July 31, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. B.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was young I suffered from pneumonia in both my lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was seriously ill.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My family even prepared for my funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I looked to the Lord and at the same time took medicine for my healing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the war in Europe broke out, my family lost several million U.S. dollars within a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My father had a stroke because of this great loss and died from it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I began to fellowship with the Brethren, but I was still not clear about my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I met Brother Nee for the first time in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I went to Peking and began to meet there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I once argued with the brothers concerning some points of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The responsible brothers even hit me with a chair and kicked me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also attended some meetings of the Bethany Congregation, and my name was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later I left that denomination and asked to have my name removed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a while I cherished some hope for the denominations, but I have since lost this hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today I no longer act like I did before.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My eyes today are on the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Taking the Straight Pathway</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should take a less detoured course in the work and should no longer busy yourself with the minor and inconsequential jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A worker must maintain his special characteristics before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, he should not be without coordination; he should work in coordination with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's way of leading can produce two results.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first case, the potter works on the vessel, and the vessel breaks as the wheel turns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Cracks appear, and the potter does not mend it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the second case, the same thing happens, but the potter decides to mend the crack.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man's intention is to take the second way, the mending way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If something is spoiled, mend it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Jeremiah 18 tells us that the worker does not mend; rather, he discards what he has broken and makes a fresh vessel out of new clay.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a parable; it speaks of God's way in leading men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a man takes a wrong step, he cannot turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God will not use those who have taken a wrong turn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He does not mend.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The only thing left to do is to ask God for mercy to make another vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some have made the wrong turn in their profession or their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God will not recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother, you have to forget about the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let the past go and close the book.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to ask the Lord to make a new vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not ask God to mend the broken pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, present a new lump to His hand, from which He can make a vessel fit for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not turn back to remake old vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a serious thing to take the wrong turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some mistakes can never be remedied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God may have to raise up another vessel for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If one slips and stumbles on the right way, he can be recovered; all he has to do is stand up again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if his pathway is wrong, it is not easy to recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is impossible to try to be a mended vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have taken a crooked pathway once, we have to accept our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not hold on to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, we should ask God to make a new vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to be pliable, and we have to know that our past ways were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The vessel is broken, and we need to have a new one made.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not hold on to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must consider the past as gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not try to mend the broken vessel, but we should have a new beginning, a new vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a vessel becomes broken, God does not remake it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, He makes a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, you have to humble yourself before God and pray that He will turn all curses into blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God may make you a more glorious vessel than you were before.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But whatever God does, you will not be the same vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the church some do not want to become God's ordained vessels, while others do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who do, bring glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the brothers all know the church, the way of the work will have less detours.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The churches everywhere may have problems, and their conditions are different.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The churches have their local situations, and there is no way we can unify their conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This problem also existed at the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more sectarian a group is, the more uniform its members are.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the more a local church is according to God's standard, the less uniform it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the churches are churches at all, they are different from locality to locality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was the church in Corinth, and there is also a church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul was a great servant of the Lord, yet even he could not unify all the churches.</S>
