   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Benefit of Practicing the New Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Practicing the new way is more than our obligation; this practice brings us countless benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, our delivering the meetings to the homes can be compared to sending people charcoal during a blizzard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose a certain family has been very cold toward the Lord; it has been difficult to make the members of that family burning for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now by sending charcoal to their house, we light up the fireplace of this family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will not only stir up their spirit, it will also burn away all their family disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past the couple always quarreled, and as a result, they would not speak to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now they can ignore each other for only six days at the most, because on the day of the home meeting they need to read the Bible, pray, and sing together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way, they have no way but to be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will be a big rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, the children of this family will be greatly influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all know that it is difficult to deal with our own children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one can boast concerning his own children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the home meeting every week will provide our children the best opportunity to receive spiritual nourishing and edification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It will also leave them with a good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The hidden benefit is truly great.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are apartment buildings throughout the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In one apartment building there are dozens of families.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If one of the families has a meeting in its home, over a period of time people will know that in this apartment building there is a family who speaks of the Lord Jesus one evening a week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when people suffer afflictions, when they are deeply distressed and discouraged, and want to find comfort, sympathy, and help, they will spontaneously look for those who believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past those people may have thought of a chapel, but now they think of the home where there is a meeting in which the Lord Jesus is preached every week.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will also affect our neighbors, colleagues, friends, and relatives because we not only preach the Lord Jesus at home, but we also testify for the Lord at work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we continue steadfastly in prayer for our friends, relatives, and colleagues, though they may not come within a year, they will eventually come within three years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This long-term practice will certainly bring in the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Home meetings can also stir up the organic function of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today in the Lord s recovery, there are still many saints who say they do not know how to speak for the Lord Jesus or preach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some elderly brothers and sisters migrated to America; however, they did not know even the English alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after listening to the English language for a period of time, they were able to speak a few simple sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently, it is not that we cannot speak but that we will not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we deliver the meetings to the saints homes, the saints may not know how to speak at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in the meeting they will be supported and even forced to speak; eventually, they will learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, it is easy for the saints to speak in a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is as easy as chatting about domestic matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The home meeting does not require eloquence, gift, or a sequence as the big meetings do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as one is willing to speak, this is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, a home meeting requires neither orderliness, good appearance, nor eloquence; these are the requirements of being in an army.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a home needs is warmth, empathy, and love; only these can keep people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Being Steadfast in Practicing</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not carry out the home meetings sporadically; rather, we should do it steadily and continually, fifty-two times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though there may be conferences, trainings, and joint meetings, we should try not to interrupt the time of our home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one thousand homes in the church in Taipei maintain such a practice, the long-term impact and benefit will be immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope the elders will have a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A SPECIFIC TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have been very encouraged by the few small groups I attended in the past two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Last Saturday I joined an outlying group.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Initially, I was slightly worried that since this group was called an outlying group, there might be only a handful of people present, and the meeting might drag.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I arrived there, I was surprised to find that it was not an outlying group at all; rather, it was a central group.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The home was filled with saints, including a sister who traveled thousands of miles from Hong Kong because she heard that I was in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This sister is a widow, and she and her household are newly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She likes to read our books and was determined to see me in person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After she found out that I was going to the outlying group, she came with her whole family to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the small group every member was a core member.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their prayers were strong, and they all functioned organically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the meeting everyone came out of the house to say good-bye to one another; it was so warm and touching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They all love the Lord and the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are truly a good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This small group proves that the church in Taipei is wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are five families in this small group, and every family is qualified to establish its own group.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They all love the Lord, their prayers are strong and clear, and their pursuit of the Life-study messages is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are able to read the sections clearly with spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If each of these five families opened their home for meetings, they will definitely bring in more people.</S>
