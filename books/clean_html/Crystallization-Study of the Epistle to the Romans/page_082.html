in the Old Testament That God Resists<br />
the Proud but Gives Grace to the Humble</h2>
<p>James 4:6 says, &ldquo;But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, &lsquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rsquo;&rdquo; If we are humble, God will come to us, and we will experience His visitation.
