   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE PRIESTHOOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to see what the function of the divine life is, we have to see more concerning the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The priesthood is a very important matter in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must consider what a priest is, what the life of a priest is, and what the function of a priest is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, we may ask who were the first priests in the Bible, who are the last priests, and what is the difference between a priest, a king, and a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Last, we must ask what the relationship is between the priesthood and the image and authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we can find out these seven matters, we will be deeply impressed with the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This has very much to do with our function as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians today do not function properly mostly due to their lack in apprehending these seven points.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WHAT A PRIEST IS One Who Serves God with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not sufficient to say that a priest is simply a person who serves God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we must say that a priest is a person who serves God through Christ as the reality of the offerings Lev 1 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Gentile priest is one who serves God without Christ, but a genuine priest of God is one who serves God with Christ, through Christ, and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One Who Enjoys Christ</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, a priest is a person who enjoys Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The priests eat what they offer as the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The serving ones serve God with Christ and through Christ, and they enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The offerings in Leviticus are for the enjoyment both of God and of the offering priest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The burnt offering was wholly burnt unto God; nothing was left as a share for the priest Lev 1:3, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the greater part of the meal offering was for the enjoyment of the priest 2:1-3; 6:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of the peace offering, the greater parts, the breast and the right thigh, were to be eaten by the priests 7:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The right thigh signifies strength, and the breast signifies love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both of these parts as a heave offering and wave offering were for the enjoyment of the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, part of the sin offering and trespass offering were for God, but much of them was to be eaten by the offering priest 6:25-26; 7:1, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One Who Lives By Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A priest is also a person who lives by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His eating is Christ, his clothing is Christ, and his dwelling is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People today always speak of eating, clothing, and housing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A priest, however, eats the offerings, that is, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, every item of the priests clothing signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They truly put on Christ as their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their dwelling place is the tabernacle, which also signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, their eating, clothing, housing, and their everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One Who Contacts God in the Mingling with God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A priest is a person who contacts God in the mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The priest s passing through the Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies is his contact with God, and this contact is not in himself but in a mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A priest s contact with God is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is, as he contacts God, he is mingled with God, not objectively but subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today as the priests, when we go to contact God, we contact Him not merely objectively but also subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not contact God apart from God; we contact God in God, that is, in the mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The whole atmosphere within the tabernacle is God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when the priest goes into the tabernacle, he is in God to contact God, and God is also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may compare this to contacting air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not contact air as we would a book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we contact the air by being in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, the air is also in us, so we are mingled with the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, if we jump into a stream and take it in, we are covered by the water, and we are also filled with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Similarly, we contact God in the mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One Who Is Absolutely and Thoroughly</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mingled with God</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A priest is one who is absolutely and thoroughly mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything in the atmosphere of the tabernacle, including the smoke, flavor, and substance of the offerings, signifies an aspect of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the priest to come into the tabernacle signifies a person coming into God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once the priest is in the tabernacle, the atmosphere, the flavor, and even the shekinah glory gets into him, producing a mingling of the priest with God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Moses stayed in such a condition with God for forty days and forty nights, he was shining Exo 34:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God shined out through him because he was mingled with God.</S>
