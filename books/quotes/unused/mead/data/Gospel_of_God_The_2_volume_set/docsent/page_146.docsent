   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The word about loving God with our whole heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving our neighbor as ourself is not to help us to inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is only to show us the kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you have never heard a word about loving God, you would not know how important it is to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you have never heard anything about loving your neighbor, you would not know how important it is to love your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once you have heard the word about loving your neighbor, you will realize that you have never loved your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, the words in the law such as loving God, loving the neighbors, not coveting or killing, are there only to expose our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They show us our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The end of the law, as James has said, is simply to serve as a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It shows you who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You do not know what your face looks like.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you look in a mirror, you see what you look like.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Formerly, you did not know that you do not love God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now you know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only is there no love with the whole heart, whole soul, whole strength, and whole mind, there is not any love for God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only is there no love for God, there is not even love for one's neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have been robbed by the robbers already.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet you still do not know what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the law, you know.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You were beaten by the robbers, left half dead, and stripped of your garments, and you did not even know it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now you know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What then did the priests and the Levites do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They came to say: "My friend, do you not know that you have been beaten by the robbers?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you not know that your garments have been stripped off?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you not know that you are half dead?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After a while, another one came.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unlike the other two, this one came journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The priest came by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Levite also came by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Samaritan came journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He came purposely to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And when he saw him, he was moved with compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had love, and he had compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, he had oil and wine with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, he could heal the one beaten by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who is this Samaritan?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 4:9 tells us that the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone mentioned in this story was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The one beaten up by the robbers was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The priest was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Levite was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What do the Jews represent?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And what does the Samaritan represent?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Jews represent us human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What about the Samaritan?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Samaritans have no dealings with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not mix in with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are apart from the Jews and above the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that this One is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day when the Lord Jesus was on earth, a group of Jews criticized the Lord Jesus and reviled Him with two very strong statements, saying that He was a Samaritan and one who had a demon John 8:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please notice that in Jesus' answer He said that He did not have a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Jews said that He was a Samaritan and had a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord denied that He had a demon but did not deny that He was a Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the Samaritan here refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John shows us that in type He is a Samaritan.</S>
