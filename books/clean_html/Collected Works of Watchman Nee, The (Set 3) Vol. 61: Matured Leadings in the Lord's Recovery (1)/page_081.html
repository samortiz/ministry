<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">APPOINTMENT OF ELDERS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 14, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</h1><p>From now on, we have to carry on the work in the church in Hong Kong in a steady way. Therefore, tonight we will officially ask a few brothers to serve as overseers. The condition of some brothers is not up to the point of such an appointment yet. I hope that all of us will humble ourselves. I hope that no one will be so proud as to think that he is qualified to be an elder. None of us should feel that we are trustworthy in ourselves, because none of us satisfy the conditions spoken of in the Epistle to Timothy. Perhaps the Lord has to oversee all of us directly.</p><p>In Hong Kong we had some responsible brothers in the past, but there was not a clear distinction between the co-workers, the responsible brothers, and the elders. Some co-workers reside here, while others do not. I will take the opportunity while everyone is here tonight to make a clear arrangement. The elders are responsible for local affairs, while the co-workers are responsible for the work in the region. Tonight, no co-worker is from outside this region. If you are a co-worker working as an elder, you have to remember that while you are living in Hong Kong, you have to coordinate with the brothers and sisters in the church in Hong Kong to serve the Lord together.</p><p>For the eldership we have four brothers: Brothers James Chen, K. H. Weigh, Chu Ze-yuen, and Hsu Jin-chin. Brother Cheng Him-yuen is very responsible in many things. He is burdened for many practical affairs, but I hope that he will have not only a feeling for practical affairs but a feeling for the brothers and sisters also. I hope that the young brothers and sisters will learn to submit to these few elderly ones.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF THE WORD ELDER</h2><p>What is an elder? The word in Greek is presbuteros. Elder is an accurate translation, but many people do not have an accurate understanding of this word; at least they do not have an accurate understanding of the matter of eldership. An elder is not only a person who is older in age, but someone who is stronger. A young brother calls his older brother "big brother." This means that the two have the same life, but that one is older and stronger than the other. Many brothers and sisters have a wrong concept that the young saints are burning while the older ones are conservative. To them the church consists of two families, not one. Some people think that the young ones are zealous while the older ones are cautious. However, the elders are presbyters; they are the "big brothers," which means that they possess something more than the younger ones and are even stronger than the young ones. The young ones may say that they love the Lord, but the elders must love the Lord more. The young ones may say that they are zealous, but the elders must be more zealous. They must be more consecrated than the others. Their zeal is the same as the others' in nature, but it must be stronger in degree. Their consecration is the same as the others' in nature, but it must be stronger in degree. In the church the elders must live a testimony of sacrificing more and forsaking more than the young brothers and sisters.</p><p>The elders are responsible for overseership. They should take the lead among the brothers and sisters, not put pressure on them from behind. Unless they can do this, they are not qualified to be elders. In the next five or ten years, there will be mass migrations to Hong Kong. If the elders do not have the proper leadership, Hong Kong will become useless. The church should have elders who are not only cautious but strong as well. Perhaps the elders are not as physically strong as the younger ones, but in consecration, love, and zeal, they cannot fall behind the younger ones. The Bible does not say anything about old Christians. If there is an old Christian, he must be old in the sense of ancient, like an old tree that flourishes by the stream. Such a one has to be more zealous than others. If anyone should be extreme, he should be the first one. The elders and the young people are two ends of the same sugarcane stick. The young people are the top end, while the elders are the bottom end. They are more juicy than the younger ones. Do not think that one is a sugarcane stick while the other is a barley stalk. No, both are the same in nature.</p>
