   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 4:4 and 5 say, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man can be saved by works, then salvation becomes a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is no longer grace, but something that one deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it is something that one deserves, then it is no longer free.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word freely in the Bible 3:24 means in the original language without a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, there is no reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of John that "they hated Me without cause" 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the original language, it can mean, "They hated Me freely."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord never spent anything to buy that hatred, but they hated Him just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was no reason attached.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was free.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's grace during those three and a half years was accomplished freely for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are like the younger son in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day we came to God and said, "God, give me the share of the estate that falls to me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God gave us what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we took our estate, we squandered it with evil companions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we have come back to the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The robe, the ring, and the shoes that we wear and the fatted calf that we eat are not what we deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That which was rightfully ours has been spent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not deserve the ring.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not deserve the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not deserve to eat the fatted calf, and we do not deserve to wear the shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What then is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When those who do not deserve to be saved are saved, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace is what those who should not obtain have obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the younger son took away the first time was not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He spent that already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What he received the second time was all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His own portion was long spent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he enjoys another meal at home, it is not what he deserves to get; it is the Father's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, if one works, the question of wages comes in, and it is no more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Grace is in conflict with what one deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How then does faith work?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When it is not work or labor, but only faith in the God who justifies the sinner, that faith is reckoned as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the relationship between faith and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If it is work, then it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it is grace, then there is only faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To believe is to accept what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not how much I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must emphasize that, before God, we are not justified by what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we have justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the question of work is forever over.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone who knows me well knows that I like soy sauce.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is all right if there are not many dishes at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as I have soy sauce, I can get by.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At one time, one who was serving me saw that my soy sauce was almost gone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He went to the market and brought more back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then he mixed it in with the good soy sauce.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I tasted it, I noticed that the taste was different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I asked why the soy sauce tasted different that day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I checked with the serving one whether or not he had poured the soy sauce from the same bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He answered yes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I wondered if my taste had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It did not seem that likely.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I then asked if he had mixed it with something else.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had to admit that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today man does the same thing to God's work and His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He tries to mix something else into them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we mix something in this way, grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That is why God says that if it is of grace, then it is no more of work Rom 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is of work, then it is no more of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Work can never be mixed with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, we must not merely say that salvation is of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must say that salvation is solely of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I love Romans 3:27.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This word is based on verses 25 and 26 which speak of how the Lord Jesus has become a propitiation place and how God has justified those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not unrighteous for God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, in verse 27 it says, "Where then is boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is excluded."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no way for us to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is no possibility to boast anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The next sentence is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It says, "Through what kind of law?"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that we have nothing to boast of anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By what way are we excluded from boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By what principle are we excluded from boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verse 27 continues, "That of works?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No, but through the law of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul asked how man can be excluded from boasting and how boasting can be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>His answer is by the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If one is in the principle of faith, then he is not in the principle of works.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If it is by the principle of works, then boasting cannot be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today we have the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, we cannot boast.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can only praise.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Philippians 2:12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Many have told us that Paul said explicitly in Philippians that we have to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we are to work out our salvation, does that not mean that we have to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Is it true that the Lord has done the work, but man also has to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is like saying that He supplies the material, we supply the labor, and the two of us work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A person says this because he does not understand the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are to work out our salvation, then what has the Lord Jesus done on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What has He accomplished on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If a thing has been accomplished, it cannot be accomplished any further.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you are a child of God, you cannot become a child of God again.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>On the cross, the Lord Jesus clearly said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The cross of the Lord Jesus has accomplished the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Since the work of salvation and redemption have been accomplished, there is no possibility for us to work out this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we still want to work out our salvation, we must first overturn the work of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must declare that the work of the Lord Jesus has not been accomplished; the Lord's work has not been finished.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>That is why we have to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many times, we do not know what it means to shame others.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But once you have experienced it, you will know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>For example, here is a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Someone has asked her to wash some handkerchiefs.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>After she has washed them, she hangs them up to dry.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But another person comes along and takes the handkerchiefs away.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When she asks for the reason, she is told that they were taken down to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is an open shame to the sister, for it means that the other person does not believe that the handkerchiefs are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It means that they think that the sister has lied.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In the same way, for us to work out our salvation is not a glory to Christ but a shame to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The Bible says clearly that Christ has accomplished all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then why does Philippians 2:12 say that we have to work out our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The word work out in the original language carries the meaning of out.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should work out our salvation in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Did Paul's word stop here?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If it had stopped here, we would not know what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Verse 13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Since God has operated in you, it is possible for you to now work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If God has not operated in, we have no way to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Since God has operated in, you can work out.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>God has already saved you within and has given you life.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Now there is no other way but to let Him come out.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>God does not want you to work.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He wants you to work out.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Hence, this is not a question of salvation or perdition, eternal life or eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is a question of whether or not one receives the reward after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>God has already operated in you, causing you to will and to work for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Hence, you have to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is the proper condition of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In other words, this is your work after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If a man has not yet been saved, he cannot work out his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If a man does not have life, he cannot live out a life.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Only after a man has been saved can he work out his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Hence, one sees that there is no such thing as being saved through good works.</S>
