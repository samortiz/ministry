<P>Before I went to meet Watchman in Hong Kong, while still in Taiwan, I finished the compiling and composing work on the second Chinese hymnal. I presented him with the manuscript, and he polished the hymn on the life of the grapevine, adding a few stanzas to it. It now appears as Hymn #635 in our English hymnal.</P><P>At that time I related to him that I had also composed sixty lessons on the basic truths of the Scriptures and that there was the need to reprint the first Chinese hymnal and some others of his publications. At this time he made the following arrangements regarding the bookroom and literature work:</P><P>1)The Gospel Bookroom should be set up in three places: Shanghai, Taipei, and Hong Kong. Watchman would personally manage the one in Shanghai; I would be responsible for the one in Taipei; and Brother Weigh would be responsible for the one in Hong Kong. Further, I was asked to assist the bookroom in Hong Kong regarding literary and editorial responsibility.</P><P>2)All three bookrooms would share the same copyrights.</P><P>(In 1975, Brother K.H. Weigh and I with other related brothers rearranged, due to the situation at that time, the matter of copyright as follows: All the Chinese books would be published by the Gospel Bookroom in Taipei; all the English books would be published by the Living Stream in the U.S.A.; the Hong Kong Church Bookroom would be used only for the distribution of our publications in Hong Kong.)</P><P>While in Hong Kong I shared with Watchman Nee how the Lord had blessed the work in Taiwan. He therefore encouraged me to return and remain there for the Lord's work.</P><P>Since I was much concerned for his return to the mainland, I had long fellowship with him one day regarding this matter. I said to him, "What the Lord's will is I dare not say. The matter is too great and serious." He said to me, "What shall we do with so many churches on the mainland? I must return to take care of them and stand with them for the Lord's testimony."</P><P>Concerning this matter, Brother Hsu Jin-chin testified to the following:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Before Brother Nee left Hong Kong, Brother Lee advised him many times not to return to the mainland. But Brother Nee said, "If a mother discovered that her house was on fire, and she herself was outside the house doing the laundry, what would she do? Although she realized the danger, would she not rush into the house? Although I know that my return is fraught with dangers, I know that many brothers and sisters are still inside. How can I not return?" Brother Lee escorted him three times back from the bus stop to his home in Diamond Hill....</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
