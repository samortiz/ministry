   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF GOD S REDEMPTION 5 Scripture Reading: Mark 16:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter sixteen of the Gospel of Mark we have three matters: the resurrection of the Slave-Savior vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-18 , the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation v. 19 , and the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples v. 20 . In this message we shall begin to consider the Slave-Savior s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST S RESURRECTION AS PRESENTED IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Gospel of Mark in a very real sense may be called the Gospel of Peter, let us consider Peter s words concerning Christ s resurrection as recorded in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In his gospel messages in chapters two, three, four, and five of Acts, Peter speaks concerning the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the resurrection of Christ was the center of Peter s gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Impossible for Him to Be Held by Death</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 2:23 and 24 Peter says, speaking of Christ, This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed; whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Peter s very first gospel message, preached on the day of Pentecost, he testified that the crucified Jesus was raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter testified that Christ could not be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since Christ Himself is resurrection John 11:25 , it was impossible for Him to be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can resurrection be held by death?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts 2:32-36 Peter speaks concerning both the resurrection and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regarding the Lord s resurrection, he says in verse 32, This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here Peter seems to be saying, We were present when the Lord Jesus was crucified, and we saw Him after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we are eyewitnesses of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 33 Peter continues, Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse speaks of Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 36 Peter refers to both resurrection and ascension: Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is in resurrection and ascension that Jesus has become the Lord and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Author of Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 3:15 Peter told the people that they had killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word rendered Author means origin, originator, chief leader.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here it denotes Christ as the origin or originator of life, hence, the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter was telling the people that they had killed the Author of life, the One whom God had raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here Peter seems to be saying, We are eyewitnesses of the One who is the origin, the source, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You killed this One, but death could not hold the One you have killed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has raised up from the dead this One who is the source of life.</S>
