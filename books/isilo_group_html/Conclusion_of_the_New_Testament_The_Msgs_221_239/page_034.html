To Be the Bride at the Marriage Feast of Christ and in the Millennium</h2><p>All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2). This means that at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers.<p>Revelation 19:7 says, &#8220;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.&#8221; The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. God&#8217;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, consisting of the overcoming believers, will be ready.<p>The words &#8220;His wife&#8221; in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, in verse .7 consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride in 19:7 depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. The overcomers are not only mature in life but are also built together as one bride.<p>Revelation 19:8 says, &#8220;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&#8221; &#8220;Pure&#8221; refers to the nature, whereas &#8220;bright&#8221; refers to the expression. The Greek word translated &#8220;righteousnesses&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;righteous acts.&#8221; These righteousnesses do not refer to the righteousness (which is Christ) we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30), a righteousness that is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God. The righteousnesses of the overcoming believers in Revelation 19:8 are subjective so that they may meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ. Hence, the fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living. This is actually the Christ whom we live out of our being.<h2 class=head2>I. To Be the Armies in Heaven Fighting with the Coming Christ against Antichrist and His Armies</h2><p>The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-21). Christ&#8217;s armies are composed of His called, chosen, and faithful ones. &#8220;He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful&#8221; (Rev. 17:14). Here we see that those with Christ are called, chosen, and faithful. It is significant that &#8220;chosen&#8221; is mentioned after &#8220;called.&#8221; To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future (Matt. 22:14). We all have been called. In order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today. In Revelation 17:14 the chosen ones are those faithful to the Lord who will become His armies.<p>Revelation 19:14 tells us that those in the Lord&#8217;s armies are &#8220;dressed in fine linen, white and pure.&#8221; This fine linen is the garment of the overcoming believers that qualifies them both to attend the marriage feast of Christ and to fight with Him against His enemy. Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment. The &#8220;fine linen, white and pure&#8221; qualifies the overcomers not only to attend the wedding feast but also to be in the armies. The overcomers who follow Christ to fight against His enemy will be properly formed heavenly armies.<p>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them. Revelation 19:19 says, &#8220;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s enemies are the beast. Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (Rev. 17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun (Rev. 9:16; 16:12). Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies. Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords with His armies, composed of the overcoming believers, will defeat Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 221-239) &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
