<h2 class="head1">V. GOD&rsquo;S ORDINATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Chosen by God</h2><p>In 6:26-29 we see God&rsquo;s ordination. This ordination is related to the genealogy in 6:16-25. For a long time, I could not understand why this genealogy is included here. Although Israel had twelve sons, this genealogy mentions only Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, the first three. This indicates that there is no intention in the record here of giving us a full genealogy. Rather, its purpose is to show the ones from Jacob to Moses who were chosen by God. These chosen ones include Levi, Kohath, Amram, and Moses. Therefore, this is actually a record, not of genealogy, but of God&rsquo;s selection, of God&rsquo;s choosing. Amram, one of the chosen ones, was the father of Moses and Aaron. Verse 26 says, &ldquo;These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies&rdquo; (Heb.). This proves that Moses and Aaron were not presumptuous but that they had been chosen by God. They had been selected and ordained by God long before they were born. This should have given Moses the assurance and the confidence that whatever God told him to do would be accomplished.</p><p>We need the same assurance today. If we are engaging in a work that has not been initiated by God, we should stop whatever we are doing. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been ordained by God; it has not been initiated by us. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no place for presumption. As we carry on the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should never be presumptuous. Rather, we should simply do what God has chosen and ordained us to do.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Commissioned by God</h2><p>Verses 28 and 29 reveal that Moses was commissioned by God: &ldquo;And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee&rdquo; (Heb.). Verse 27 also indicates that Moses and Aaron had been commissioned by God to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt: &ldquo;These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as Moses and Aaron were commissioned, we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have also been commissioned. I have the full assurance that we are a commissioned people. God has entrusted to us the commission of carrying out His recovery today.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Representing God</h2><p>Moses also represented God (7:1). Whenever we are commissioned by someone, we also represent that one. Because Moses was commissioned by God, he also represented God. In the same principle, because we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been commissioned by God, we represent Him.</p><p>Be very careful how you touch those who represent God. It is possible to touch the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in a way that is not profitable. I can testify from years of experience that no one who has touched the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in a negative way has gone on to receive blessing. Because those who have received God&rsquo;s commission are His representatives, it is a serious matter to touch them in an improper way. Of those who contacted the church and later became negative, I do not know one whose spiritual condition has remained the same. Without exception, there has been the loss of spiritual blessing. In every case there has been spiritual decline. This indicates that it is a serious matter to become involved in a negative way with those who have been commissioned by God and who therefore represent Him.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Represented by Aaron</h2><p>On the one hand, Moses represented God; on the other hand, Moses was represented by Aaron (7:1-2). Representation is different from presentation. The difference is that representation involves authority, whereas presentation does not. With God&rsquo;s commission there is always the matter of authority. This authority is related both to representing God and to being represented by others.</p><p>None of us should assume authority. We should simply let authority be present with the Lord&rsquo;s ordination and commission. If we would be today&rsquo;s sent ones, we must be certain that we have been chosen, ordained, and commissioned. Then we shall know that we are God&rsquo;s representatives.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. GOD&rsquo;S STRONG HAND<br />OF GREAT JUDGMENT</h2><p>The last point in God&rsquo;s further training of Moses concerns God&rsquo;s strong hand of great judgment. In 7:4 the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.&rdquo; In 6:1 the Lord had already told Moses that he would see what the Lord would do to Pharaoh: &ldquo;For by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land&rdquo; (Heb.).</p><p>Without a strong hand, talk is vain. This is seen in diplomatic negotiations between nations today. Such negotiations depend upon the backing of military power. In his negotiations with Pharaoh, Moses&rsquo; word was to be backed by the strong hand and mighty judgments of the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s strong hand would be proof to Pharaoh that God was not speaking vain words. By the Lord&rsquo;s hand, the Egyptians would know that He is Jehovah. As 7:5 says, &ldquo;And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt&rdquo; (Heb.).</p><p>Because Moses had complained to the Lord, it was necessary for the Lord to speak to Moses concerning His hand. It seems as if the Lord were saying, &ldquo;Moses, I have not only a mouth, but also a strong hand. Go and speak to Pharaoh. I will harden him so that My hand may be manifested. Speak My word to Pharaoh. My hand will back up My word. I shall stretch forth My hand to perform whatever you say to Pharaoh on My behalf.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s hand was a strong confirmation that Moses had been sent by God.</p><p>Throughout the years, we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s hand back up His word. When there was opposition to God&rsquo;s word, eventually His hand was manifested. God never speaks in vain. His word is always backed up by His strong hand.</p><p>Pharaoh could resist the Lord&rsquo;s word, but he could not resist the Lord&rsquo;s hand. In the following messages, we shall see that the conflicts between God and Pharaoh became more and more intense until they reached the point that Pharaoh drove the children of Israel away. Because the Lord&rsquo;s strong hand of great judgment backed up His word, Pharaoh was eventually compelled to drive the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. May we all learn the lesson concerning God&rsquo;s hand and all the lessons in God&rsquo;s further training of Moses.</p>
