   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God for working in a small number of young brothers in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through their zeal for the gospel, many brothers and sisters have been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These brothers felt that being lukewarm, half-living and half-dead Christians was unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they were going to be Christians, they had to give their all and consecrate everything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They felt that they should follow the Gospels and drop everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If not, they could not be good Christians today in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They also felt that young people did not need to study so many spiritual theories or deep doctrines; neither did they need to sit around hoping to become a Brother Lawrence or a Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They felt that the easiest, most basic, and most practical thing to do was to preach the gospel and not be ashamed of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They took a strong stand for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They reckoned that if they did not learn to preach the gospel and were not exercised in this matter, it would be useless to talk about other matters because they would have no spiritual future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is one heart-rending fact: The gospel has been in China for over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet the gospel is still confined to the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many who serve mammon are not afraid of anything; they do not care about sacrifice but move to inland remote regions for the sake of money, business, or career.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But few of God's children are willing to go inland for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must confess that many souls are perishing because of our lack of zeal and burden for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that the gospel is the Lord's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With regard to geography, we should preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With regard to the audience, we should preach the gospel to all the creation Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Preaching is the special privilege of every saved sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An angel could only say to Cornelius that his prayers and alms were remembered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Cornelius wanted to hear the gospel, he sent for Peter Acts 10:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The angel did not have the privilege of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone once said that if God allowed the angels to preach the gospel, the heavens would immediately be emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, preaching the gospel clears one's debt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul said that he owed everyone a debt, whether Greek, barbarian, wise, or foolish Rom 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we must emphasize one point: Preaching the gospel is the responsibility of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether we like it or not, the debt must be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No Christian can say that he does not have a share in the matter of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps we are not lacking in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But who dares to say that he has paid off the debt of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are debtors to every sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should pay our debt to every sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, the brothers all felt they must at least pay back their debt of the gospel to the five million inhabitants of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have already made more than twenty vests with gospel slogans written on the back and front.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some vests have "Vanity of vanities" on the front and "All is vanity" on the back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others have "Turn back, do turn back," on the front and "Why should you perish?" on the back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Still others have "Christ came into the world" on the front and "to save sinners" on the back.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We wear the vests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some carry gospel tracts, some carry "gospel" flags, and some play the accordion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We go out in groups to the busy streets in the middle of the city and walk down the sidewalks on both sides of the road.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we march, we pass out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we reach a park or an empty public place, we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have also prepared a large truck with an amplifier and a speaker to go to places farther away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have only gone out a few times, and there is no obvious fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, one fact remains a small gospel bomb has been dropped in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we marched, thousands and tens of thousands of people watched us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>People came out of the alleys and buildings to watch us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every time we returned, we were inwardly filled with joy and zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We feel that our inward fellowship with the Lord is now more intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We seem to be more separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Indeed the gospel shoes are the only thing that can separate us from the earth and keep us in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord has mercy on us, we hope to continue this work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day we hope that "there will be no place left to preach" in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We ask the brothers and sisters in each locality to take advantage of this unique opportunity to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should do what we can for the gospel, as Brother Paul said, "I do all things for the sake of the gospel" 1 Cor 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should live, die, teach, study, do business, run factories, labor, have families, and do everything for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul said that everything he did was for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope we would have this attitude toward the gospel: No matter where we are or what we do, we are special agents for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we live this way, our walk will match our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The gospel is God's love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The gospel is the expression of God's grace; it is God's sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To us it is the gospel, but to God it is the sacrifice of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we want to preach the gospel but do not exercise love or grace in our living, or if we are not willing to sacrifice or suffer, turning "the other cheek," letting others "take our cloak," or going the "extra mile," we are not worthy of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The gospel is not just a work; it is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do not strive in one accord, it is very difficult for the gospel to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May this small fire of the gospel in Shanghai burn the cold hearts of many of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May this small bomb wake up many sleeping Christians so that they would not miss this opportunity and would not be ashamed of the gospel, but instead would preach the Lord's gospel well.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can say this: If we neglect this opportunity to preach the gospel with our mouth today, perhaps one day we will have to preach it with our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Chang Yu-zhi</S>
