<p>In Exodus 3 holy fire, not strange fire, was burning in the thornbush. We know the fire was holy because Jehovah spoke from within the fire (vv. 4-6). This holy fire was God expressed. When the Israelites erected the tabernacle in the wilderness, &ldquo;the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle&rdquo; (40:34). This glorious cloud signifies God. At night the cloud became a pillar of fire (13:21). The pillar of fire denotes God&rsquo;s power. Hence, the vision that Moses saw in chapter 3 represents the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness. Because Moses represents the Israelites, they experienced what Moses experienced. The fire first burned in Moses and then in the Israelites. If the holy fire of God had not burned in Moses first, it could not have burned in the Israelites. Just as Moses was a thornbush before God, so the Israelites were a thornbush before God. Just as the holy fire burned in Moses, so the holy fire also burned in the midst of the Israelites.</p>
<p>The holy fire of God coming to the thornbush means that God came forth to be among His chosen people. Exodus 3:2 says that the fire in the thornbush was God: &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thornbush.&rdquo; The title <em>the Angel of Jehovah</em> refers to the Lord Jesus as the sent One. Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;Jehovah...God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush and said, Moses...Do not come near here.&rdquo; Verse 2 says that the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Moses, but verse 4 says that Jehovah God spoke with Moses. The Angel who came to the earth was Jesus Christ, the One who was sent by God and is God. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.&rdquo; Where did He &ldquo;come down&rdquo; to? He came down to the thornbush. When the God of resurrection came forth as the Angel of Jehovah, He came forth in His Son, Christ Jesus, the One whom He sent. He came forth in the form of fire in the thornbush, man.</p>
<p>The fire in Exodus 3 can be linked to the fire in Luke 12 and in Acts 2. Acts 2:3 says, &ldquo;There appeared to them tongues as of fire.&rdquo; In Luke 12:49-50 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!&rdquo; The Lord Jesus wanted to release His life. When His divine life is released, there is fire. The holy fire of God is kindled with the coming of resurrection life. As the Angel of Jehovah and in His resurrection life, God comes to man, the thornbush, so that He can be kindled and burn in man.</p>
<p>The vision in Exodus 3 shows who we are and what has come into us. We are a thornbush, but the holy fire is in us. This holy fire is God expressed in His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY FIRE NOT USING THE THORNBUSH AS FUEL</h2>
<p>The fire burned in the thornbush but did not consume it. When the Israelites offered a sacrifice, they placed the sacrifice on the altar for it to be consumed by fire. But the thornbush was not consumed. The fire burning in the thornbush did not take the thornbush as fuel, just as the divine fire within us does not use us as fuel. When a house is on fire, it does not take much time for the house to burn down, because the house is the fuel for the fire. When the fire of God was burning in the thornbush, it was God who was burning. Hence, God does not use what is in us. The thornbush was not the fuel for the fire; it was merely a place for the fire to be expressed.</p>
<p>The fire did not depend on the thornbush in order to burn. Moses was used by God according to this principle. God&rsquo;s fire of glory was expressed through Moses, a thornbush, in order for God to deal with the magicians and the officials of Egypt and with Pharaoh. Even though the fire was burning, Moses was not consumed.</p>
<p>We must see that we are but a thornbush and that God has come upon us in resurrection as fire. He will do what He wants to do in us, but we will not be consumed. He will not use our capabilities or our abilities to strengthen the fire or to make it brighter. The strength and the brightness of the fire come from the fire itself; the fire is merely resting on us. Our purpose is merely to express the fire.</p>
<p>When Moses was forty years old, he could not be entrusted with this fire. He could use his fists, his own strength, to kill an Egyptian, and he could use his own method to bury the body (2:12), but he could not be entrusted with the fire of resurrection. His strength and his method did not come to an end until he was eighty years old. That was when he could be entrusted with the fire of God. With the staff in his hand, Moses let the fire burn in him (4:17).</p>
<p>In order for us to let the fire be expressed, we must see that our tactics and our abilities are useless in God&rsquo;s work, just as our insight and our strength do not have any place in His work. We must put these aside. In Exodus 2:12 Moses had natural insight and strength: &ldquo;He looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one there, he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.&rdquo; However, if Moses had continued to use his insight and strength, the fire of God could not have come forth. The fire could burn only in a thornbush, a plant that is dried up. Those who put aside their insight and their strength can be entrusted with the resurrection fire of God; they can be a place for the resurrection fire of God to be expressed.</p>
<p>If we want to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand, we must see that the resurrection life of God coming upon us is the expression of the divine power. He does not use us as fuel. We must put aside our views and our strength. They are useless. If we hold on to them, we will have to wait for forty years. The children of Israel spent forty years in the wilderness. The number forty represents trials. These trials will wear out our abilities and our capabilities. If we feel that we still have the strength to strike others and the insight to consider matters, God will allow many trials to come upon us until, in our estimation, we are old, our eyes are dim, our arms are dropping, and everything is over.</p>
<p>God does not use our activities, insight, or strength. He calls us to be material for Him to rest upon. He wants to use us, but He will not use our insight or our strength. He wants to rest on us. Our strength and insight are a frustration to Him. It is not until we stop exercising our abilities that God can come to us and use us.</p>
<p>God demands that we stop exercising our insight, strength, methods, and capabilities, which are all natural. God cannot use us while our natural being is still active. In order to be useful in His hand, we must stop our natural strength and the activity of our natural man. When our person has stopped, the fire of resurrection will burn in us. To be eighty years old is to be dead. Where there is death, there will be resurrection; without death, there cannot be resurrection. If our natural man is not put to death, the holy fire cannot be kindled or expressed. This is the ultimate meaning of the vision of the thornbush. This vision was first fulfilled in Moses and later in the people of Israel.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
