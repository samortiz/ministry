   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regeneration is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some inner life teachers said that it was not so easy to be regenerated, and they called regeneration the first blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I read a number of writings in an attempt to understand what regeneration is, but I could not find the answer until I read an article by Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said that regeneration was to receive God s divine life in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was happy when I read that definition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that day I understood what regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit John 3:3, 5-6 , thus obtaining God s divine life to become the sons of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I checked with my experience and the experiences of other believers, I found out that regeneration is not difficult to experience but that it is a very normal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regeneration is instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is like taking a picture with a camera; at the appropriate time a click captures all the scenery onto the film.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This click takes less than one second.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we began to preach the gospel by visiting people, some wondered how people could be regenerated within fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But regeneration takes place instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We instructed the full-time trainees in Taipei to use the booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life in their preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This booklet talks about God s creation, man s fall, Christ s redemption, and God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After reading a portion of this booklet to a person, we can say, Please follow me to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After leading him to call on the Lord in a strong way, we can read Romans 10:13 to him to assure him of his salvation Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we can read Mark 16:16 He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we preach the gospel like this in a proper way, we are taking the lens cover off of the camera.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we can lead this one to the water of baptism, and when we are baptizing him, we can pray, Lord, we baptize this one into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is such a person genuinely regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, only the Lord Himself knows who is genuine and who is not, who is real wheat and who is a tare Matt 13:24-30, 36-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible to discern the tares from the wheat until the fruit is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow but that of the tares is black.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they sprout, blossom, and bear fruit, everyone can discern the difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our responsibility is to get the camera ready by pointing it toward the scenery and taking the lens cover off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is all that we can do, and this is all that we have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We leave the actuality and reality to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have observed, however, that many have been genuinely regenerated instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is miraculous yet normal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be filled with the Spirit essentially Acts 13:52 is to be filled in our spirit Eph 5:18 for our spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be filled with the Spirit economically Acts 4:8, 31 is by the outpouring of the Spirit of power Acts 2:17-18 , clothing us with power from on high Luke 24:49 for our spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some inner-life teachers said that after being regenerated, a person had to receive what they called the fullness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This terminology is not so accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fullness is the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they used the word fullness for the infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What they meant by this term was the inward filling of the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They referred to this matter as the second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They did not differentiate the infilling of the Spirit from the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The infilling is within us, and the outpouring is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The disciples received the Holy Spirit within when the Lord came back to them on the day of His resurrection and breathed the essential Spirit into them John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the evening of the day of resurrection, the disciples received the inner Spirit of Christ essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later the Lord charged them to wait in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be clothed is different from drinking of the inner Spirit as revealed in 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To drink is to take the water into us, and to be clothed is to put the clothes upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To drink of the water is something related to the inner life, whereas to be clothed is related to our outward work in our duty or position.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Forty days after the disciples had received the inner Spirit, the Lord charged them to wait for the promised Spirit, which would come in another ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time they would receive another aspect of the Spirit, the economical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The essential aspect of the Spirit is for our life and living and the economical aspect of the Spirit is for our ministry and work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit entered into the disciples essentially when the Lord breathed into them, and on the day of Pentecost, fifty days later, the Spirit came upon them economically Acts 2:2-4,14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The economical Spirit of power equipped them to accomplish their commission.</S>
