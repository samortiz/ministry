<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE&mdash;<br />
CAUSING MAN TO GAIN THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Genesis 2 there are three steps in God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill His purpose: the first step is God creating man in verses 4 through 7; the second step is God having man receive His life in verses 8 through 17; and the third step is God causing man to gain His life in verses 18 through 25. This chapter covers the last step of God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill His purpose. If God had taken only the first step to create man and the second step to have man receive His life, His life would not have been able to come forth out of Him and enter into man so that He could be joined with man as one. Therefore, there is the need for a third step, which is to cause man to gain God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Since God wants man to receive His life, He works so that man can gain His life. For the sake of receiving His life, God gave man the freedom to choose, and thus man bears full responsibility for his choices. Nevertheless, God still had to work in order for His life to be wrought into man. Without this further work after the creation of man, God&rsquo;s life would not have been able to come forth out of Himself and enter into man, even if man could choose freely. Therefore, after the first and second steps, there was still the need for a third step. God created man, and then He placed man in a position to receive His life, but a further work was needed in order for God&rsquo;s life to come forth out of Himself and enter into man. Only through these three steps could God work on man to the point where man becomes exactly the same as He is in order to be joined as one to Him as His counterpart.</p>
<p>The last account in Genesis 2 shows the last step of God&rsquo;s work through a symbolic picture. We should read Genesis 2 as if we were evaluating a painting or reading a poem. We should not merely read the letters; rather, we should contemplate and comprehend the symbolic meaning of all the items in this account in order to see the spiritual connotations. Based on Ephesians 5, we know that the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2 symbolizes Christ and the church. Adam typifies Christ, and Eve typifies the church. The joining of Adam and Eve as one flesh symbolizes the joining of Christ and the church as one mystical Body.</p>
<p>The account in Genesis 2 is very meaningful. Not only do we need to know that it refers to Christ and the church, but we also need to have a penetrating view that the relationship between Christ and the church is simply the relationship between God and man. The last step of God&rsquo;s work in this account is the working of His life into man in order to make man the same as He is so that man can become His counterpart and be joined to Him as one.</p>
<p>Let us consider the account in Genesis 2 step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Background</h2>
<p>The background of the work of God in creation speaks of God&rsquo;s desire. If we read Genesis 2 carefully, we can easily see Adam&rsquo;s situation. At that time, there was a beautiful garden in addition to the heavens and the earth. God prepared everything that man needed for his existence. Adam lacked nothing. He needed the sun, so there was the sun. He needed air, so there was air. He needed food, so there were water and fruit. Everything was ready. Even his dwelling place, a very pleasant and satisfying place, was provided. Everything needed for man&rsquo;s existence was ready and available.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adam was alone. Hence, in verse 18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; In chapters 1 and 2 God saw that His work was &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and on the last day, after the creation of man, God saw that His work was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (1:31). This means that the situation of the universe and in man&rsquo;s environment was very good. Nevertheless, something was missing even in this pleasant situation, because God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; Except for this one thing, everything was good.</p>
<p>This may be likened to a young man in a wealthy family. His parents provide everything that he needs, including his house and furniture. Everything is good, and nothing is bad. However, something is missing in this wonderful situation: it is not good for the young man to be alone; he lacks a counterpart. Likewise, in the universe, all things were completed and ready, but a counterpart was missing. A counterpart is like a duplicate of the original copy; it looks like the original. The two are identical; therefore, they match each other. A cat cannot be a cow&rsquo;s counterpart, and a mouse cannot be a pig&rsquo;s counterpart, because they are not alike. They do not match.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
