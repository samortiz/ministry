   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's will in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S WILL IN SUFFERING.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Luke xxii.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>42, we read: "Not My will, but Thine be done."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These words, spoken in Gethsemane, indicate that Christ put His will on God's side, in the awful anguish He was going through.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The pressure was so strong that His sweat became as great drops of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Not My will, but Thine," was the declaration of His attitude as He set His will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had come to the same choice just before "Now is My soul troubled, and what shall I say?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Father, save Me from this hour?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Shall I say, Father, save Me'?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"No," but "Father, glorify Thy Name."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ put His will for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And as He put His will on God's side against this awful pressure, He was heard, He was sustained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then an angel came and ministered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you too will make this the central principle of the spiritual life, and set the helm of your will unvaryingly to choose God's will because it is God's will, then He will apply to your life Christ's victory on Calvary in such a way, as to endue you with power, for the deliverance of others from the power of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>HOW THE LORD KNEW THE WILL OF GOD.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus knew the will of God in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>See John iv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4: "He must needs go through Samaria."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The literal rendering is that "It was binding upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was God's will that He should go, and He knew it, because His spirit was pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are to know the will of God you must not have a hard or unbending spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need a spirit so flexible that it can move whichever way God wants, and I do not see how we are going to know and walk in the will of God, in harmony with God's Word, unless we consent to this walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you insist that such and such a course must be taken to-morrow, you have not left yourself open to the will of God to effect any change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord does not seem to have had inflexibly fixed plans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"But are we to make no plans?" you ask.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, but they should be made in such a way that you can drop them, if necessary, in a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will not walk continuously in the will of God until you have learnt how to be pliable to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A flexible spirit to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must have a flexible spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is one of the first principles of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A meeting that cannot become elastic and subject to the movements of God, becomes a dead block in the way of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The human spirit must be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit that just as He spoke to Philip, and said "Join yourself to this chariot," so He may make known His will to you, and get as ready a response.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>An adaptable spirit is essential to fulfil the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's spirit was adaptable enough to respond to the needs and questions of Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The will of God will be known in your spirit according to the attitude of the person who comes to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If your spirit is closed, you can pass on no living truth to that person, probably because they are not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you traced and followed the delicate sense of your spirit it would become acute, and God could then make His will known to you all in harmony with the written Word, for the Holy Spirit revealing in your spirit God's mind cannot contradict Himself in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would mean a great deal if we all walked in the spirit and knew when we were speaking from the spirit and when merely from the mind, and therefore empty of spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The spirit should illuminate the mind, but when the spirit drops out of co-operation with the Holy Spirit, the mind is left without the needed assistance, and its product is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you are in the spiritual plane and know the Holy Spirit in your spirit, you recognise there are grave consequences attached to all you do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You cannot go back from the spirit life without stepping into a pathway of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The moment you drop from the plane that you have reached you begin to lose spirit strength, and if you do not recover your place quickly you will ultimately sink into deeper failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The loss not only affects yourself but everyone with whom you have to deal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may wrongly interpret or reject the words of a servant of God, and that would cause you to go back without knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This hindrance to your spirit life will be maintained while that wrong thought or attitude is held.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Holy Spirit has once had the quickening of your mind so that your mind becomes capable of doing what it could not accomplish naturally, then in order to maintain that you will be obliged to live up to the highest point you have attained, and be satisfied with nothing below.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If, after reaching an altitude in the spirit life, you descend, even without knowing it, you will find yourself in the realm where the powers of darkness can buffet you almost as they like.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God only manifests His Divine power when you are living and acting at the point to which you have already attained see Phil iii.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>16 .</S>
