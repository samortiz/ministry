        <h2 class="head1">THE VISION IN THE FIRST AND LAST CHAPTERS<br />
OF THE BIBLE<br />
BEING OPENED TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Over the past few years the Lord has gradually been revealing to His church the vision in the first and last chapters of the Bible. We have been &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; by this vision; God wants to show us only this matter. When I muse upon God&rsquo;s Word, I always come to the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. We are not proud, but God has indeed opened these four chapters to us. We cannot say that we have not seen this vision. These four chapters of the Bible are shining brightly. Hence, we have no need to remain on the detour. For two thousand years the church has been on the detour and has wasted much time. In this last age God is bringing us back to the main line. We need to lead people according to God&rsquo;s plan so that they may contact and enjoy God as life and also build up the church. As long as God&rsquo;s life is operating in people, it will produce glorious results.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING GOVERNED BY THE VISION<br />
OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>If we see the vision of the tree of life and are governed by this vision when we read the Bible, the Bible will become a new book to us. We will see the central line of the Bible and will discover that the Bible is concerning God being life. Even in the Old Testament there are many portions concerning God being life. For example, Psalm 34:8 says, &ldquo;Taste and see that Jehovah is good,&rdquo; and Psalm 36:8 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psalm 23 is a description of God being man&rsquo;s life. Many people have expounded on this psalm, but few have pointed out that there is a blessing in this psalm and that this blessing is God Himself. However, we know that the green pastures and the waters are God Himself (v. 2) and that both righteousness and the paths are God (v. 3). We also know that we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but God Himself is with us (v. 4). The table that we enjoy is God, the oil is God, and God is the blessing in the overflowing cup (v. 5). He is our goodness and lovingkindness, and He is also the house in which we dwell (v. 6). All the items in this psalm are God.</p>
<p>We can say this because of what the Lord Jesus said in John 10. In verse 11 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&rdquo; In verse 10 He said, &ldquo;I have come that they [men] may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Thus, all the blessings that the Lord as the Shepherd gives to man depend on His becoming man&rsquo;s life. Hence, the edible pastures, the drinkable waters, the paths of righteousness, the table spread before us in the presence of our adversaries, the oil on our head, the cup that runs over, goodness and lovingkindness, and the house of Jehovah are all God Himself. This exposition of the Bible is under the governing vision of the first two chapters of Genesis. Some may think that this is a different kind of exposition, but such an exposition is the only correct exposition of the Bible. Psalm 27 is also concerning God being our life. Here David says, &ldquo;Jehovah is my light and my salvation&rdquo; (v. 1). David does not say, &ldquo;Jehovah gave me light and gave me salvation&rdquo;; he says, &ldquo;Jehovah is my light and my salvation.&rdquo; These psalms indicate that the psalmists enjoyed God in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the psalmists spoke according to the vision in the first two chapters of Genesis and knew that God is food to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The New Testament also speaks concerning God becoming man&rsquo;s enjoyment. In 1 Peter 2:2-3 Peter charges the believers, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; In 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul says that the saints are called through God &ldquo;into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; In verse 2 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;is theirs and ours,&rdquo; indicating that Christ is for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels the Lord said numerous times that He is our enjoyment. In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; A person lives because of what he eats. The Lord is our food; hence, when we eat Him, we will live because of Him. When the Lord established His supper, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; Then He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). These verses show that true remembrance of the Lord is to eat and drink Him.</p>
<p>Most saints think that to remember the Lord is to consider the Lord with the mind; they do not know how to eat and drink the Lord. In the bread-breaking meeting the saints often consider the Lord&rsquo;s life and pray, &ldquo;Lord, You were on the throne, but one day You became flesh and were born in a manger. Your path was from Bethlehem to Galilee, to Jerusalem, and finally to Golgotha, where You were crucified. On the third day You rose from the dead and appeared to the disciples for forty days to speak to them concerning the kingdom of God. Then You were lifted up into heaven from the Mount of Olives. You are now at the right hand of God interceding for us, and in the future You will bring us into glory.&rdquo; Such prayers are no different in nature from the way most people remember the deeds of their ancestors. In Luke 22, however, the Lord took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and charged them, saying, &ldquo;This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (v. 19). Hence, only eating and drinking the Lord are the proper way to remember Him.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
