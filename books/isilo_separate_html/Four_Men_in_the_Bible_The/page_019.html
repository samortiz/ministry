<p>God also has anointed us with the Spirit as ointment. This ointment, which is God Himself, anoints God&rsquo;s element and essence into us. Consider the application of paint. When I paint a wooden table, I spread the element of paint onto the table, and the element of paint is manifested. When God anoints us, He anoints us with Himself as the anointing oil. The more He anoints and paints us, the more He anoints His element and essence into us. With each application of paint on the table, the table gains an additional element of the paint. Hence, calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is not a small matter. We need to realize that when we call, we are not only breathing and drinking in the Lord, but we are also letting the Lord anoint us and paint us. This anointing anoints the essence and element of God into us. Once an unbeliever is saved and begins to call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; the element and essence of God will be anointed into him, and after a few years he will be a different person.</p>
<p>Because we have all called upon the name of the Lord, I believe that we have the full assurance that the element and essence of God have been anointed into us. Additionally, because we call on the Lord every day, the element of God that has been anointed into us far exceeds our previous experience of touching and receiving the Lord. The more we call on the Lord, the more the element of God will increase in us.</p>
<p>God has anointed us. This is not a theological teaching. Theology usually stresses that God is unique, that He created the heavens and the earth, that we need to repent for our sins, and that we should fear God and honor our parents. Learning these theological teachings, however, does not mean that we have been anointed inwardly with the element and essence of God. We may have learned a doctrine about fearing God and honoring our parents, but we still have a desire to watch movies in the theater. If we call on the Lord Jesus but still go to a movie from time to time, something within us will not be peaceful, and there will even be a sense of regret within us. This sense is not related to doctrinal knowledge in our mind but to the living element of our Lord that has been anointed into our being. This element cannot be reconciled with the environment of a movie theater; this element is holy and separate. This is the reason that we have no inward peace when we are watching a movie; we may even feel inwardly unclean. We may not like to hear a word such as this, but God does, and so do those who love the Lord. We have an anointing within us that anoints us with the element and essence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Sealing and the Pledging<br />
to Be Firmly Attached to the Anointed One</h2>
<p>God has also sealed us with the Spirit as a seal. This seal is not only an imprint; it is God Himself. My Bible is stamped with a seal bearing my name, and this imprint proves that the Bible is mine. Anyone who picks up my Bible cannot keep it as his own. Furthermore, the image of the seal on my Bible is the same shape of the imprinting seal in my pouch. God has sealed us with the Spirit so that we not only belong to Him, but we also bear His image. God has stamped us with the Holy Spirit, and now we bear His image. We belong to the Lord; we have the image of God. Although we dare not claim to be absolutely different from worldly people, there is something different about us, whether we are at a train station, at our work place, at our school, or at any other place. This is because the Lord is being manifested through us. Once our inward parts are filled with the Lord, it is difficult not to express the Lord outwardly. When our whole being bears the Lord&rsquo;s seal, we do not need to wear a sign that says we are Christians. Simply by calling, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; our difference is manifested.</p>
<p>I often welcome visiting saints at airports or at train stations, many of whom I do not know. However, it is not difficult for me to tell them apart from other passengers. We truly are different from the worldly people. When we call upon the Lord daily and hourly, the Spirit as the divine seal is stamped upon us. When the Spirit is applied to us as a seal, our expression of God&rsquo;s image proves that we belong to God.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spirit is a pledge to us. The word <em>pledge</em> implies many things in Greek, including the thought of security, guarantee, warranty, foretaste, and sample. When a person buys oranges at a fruit market, he is often given an orange slice to prove their sweetness. This slice is a sample and a guarantee that all the oranges he buys will be as sweet. Hence, the slice is a guarantee, a warranty. The Spirit being in us is a foretaste, sample, guarantee, and pledge that the God whom we will enjoy in the future is the One we are tasting today. Therefore, the Spirit is a foretaste. Every cook in a kitchen has the advantage of tasting every savory dish that is being prepared. The enjoyment in the kitchen is a foretaste; the eating at the table is the full enjoyment. We have been given the Lord as a foretaste, which assures us that the coming full taste will not only be the same but also fuller. This pledge is not only meant to assure and guarantee our coming full taste; it is also for our enjoyment today.</p>
<p>Today we can drink of the Spirit. Today we can be anointed with the element of God. Today we can be sealed with God and bear the image of God, and today we can enjoy God as a sample, a foretaste, and a guarantee. These experiences are not doctrines. When we experience drinking of this Spirit, being anointed with this Spirit, being sealed with this Spirit, and receiving this Spirit as a pledge, we will realize that God has firmly attached us to the anointed One&mdash;Jesus Christ. He is God&rsquo;s anointed One, in whom are all the spiritual riches. He is everything, and we are firmly attached to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SEEKING EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES<br />
BUT TAKING THE WAY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We should never be distracted to think that we need to speak in tongues, using sounds like &ldquo;<em>di di da da.</em>&rdquo; When we simply open our being to Him from deep within, contact Him, and call, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; He will be real and living in us. We need to give Him a thoroughfare in our being and not say, &ldquo;This is a dead end.&rdquo; No matter how He operates, we need to give Him a thoroughfare in our being. He wants to enter into our thoughts, so we should say, &ldquo;Welcome, Lord.&rdquo; We should not shut off His entrance into our thoughts. He wants to enter our emotions, so we should say, &ldquo;Welcome, Lord.&rdquo; He wants to examine our conscience, so we should say, &ldquo;You are even more welcome.&rdquo; If He says that something is not right, we should say Amen. If He says that we need to deal with something, we should say, &ldquo;This is wonderful.&rdquo; We need to cooperate with Him and let Him occupy us from within and saturate our entire being. Then we will be full of living water and covered with the anointing oil, and we will have a seal and a pledge of full enjoyment in our being. By being firmly attached to the anointed One in our spirit, we will enjoy all that He is.</p>
<p>There is no need to seek for extraordinary experiences, even though God may give us some. I had several dreams in 1934 involving threatening circumstances. Later I went through an exceedingly great trial. During this trial I was reminded of my dreams, and then I understood that God had given me these dreams so that I would be comforted with the realization that my life would be preserved during my trial. Even if we have some extraordinary experiences, we should not seek for them. We should not seek odd things but take the proper way to live a normal life by knowing the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, who is water, ointment, a seal, and a pledge to us. We have a spirit to contact Him. We can enjoy Him when we open our whole being to contact Him moment by moment, call on His name, and pray-read His Word. If we provide Him with a thoroughfare in our being, He will be able to spread, saturate, and gain our whole being, and we will grow in Him and enjoy His riches. Then we will live in the church life. The Lord&rsquo;s leading in His recovery is for the churches to take the proper way of life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
