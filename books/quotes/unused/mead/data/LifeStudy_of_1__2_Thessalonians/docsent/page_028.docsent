   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE EIGHT THE CHURCH IN THE TRIUNE GOD 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1; 2 Thes 1:1; Matt 28:19; Acts 19:5; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27; Rev 1:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that 1:1 indicates that the church is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul speaks of the Triune God in 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we have the threefold blessing of the Triune God, the blessing of love, grace, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Triune God revealed in this verse is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The very God in whom the church is today is the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE FATHER'S DESIRE AND PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is it that God the Father desires?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the New Testament, the Father wants many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father's concern is with sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to produce these sons, He has been begetting children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Him, there need be no limit to the number of children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more children He has, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father wants sons, and He is begetting them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God the Father has a definite purpose in producing many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not a foolish father, one without a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, He has a purpose and a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's selection and predestination are according to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First He selected us and then predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that God is the unique initiator and originator.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, for the church to be in God the Father implies that the church is in God's purpose, plan, selection, and predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No doubt, the church is also in God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church in God the Father is the church in the One who is the initiator and originator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This understanding of the church in the Father is not merely a matter of doctrine; rather, it has much to do with us in our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A problem among Christians today is that they have many different purposes and plans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are different initiators and originators.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We Christians all should have the unique purpose, the purpose of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should also have the unique plan of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that only one the Father should be the initiator and originator.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not originate anything or initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Imagine what would happen if all Christians gave up their own purposes and plans and had only one initiator and originator.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What oneness there would be among us all!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There would be no division whatever.</S>
