   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the first century, the Lord Jesus came and saw some idle fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These He hired to work in His vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the following centuries the Lord has been calling people to labor in His vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably the present time is five o'clock in the afternoon of the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The United States is large and wealthy, but in the eyes of the Lord few are working.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most are idle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord has called us and hired us at five o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will be working for the kingdom for a short time, and then we may be the first ones to receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may be rewarded before Peter, John, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I laughed at Peter when I read this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was called much earlier than we, but we may receive the reward first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am sure that the Lord Jesus will not pay him more than He pays us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't you believe that we are the ones called at five o'clock in the afternoon?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you think that this is still the noontime of the age of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What time is it?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that it is late in the afternoon of the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps brothers like J.N. Darby and George M ller were called at three o'clock, but we were called at five.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the rewards are given, we may be first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Will you not laugh at Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Brother Peter, you made a good bargain, but we have received the benefits."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am very happy that I was born in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am glad that I was called, not early in the morning, but at this time, in the late afternoon of the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This parable reveals that the kingdom is not a matter of commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is not selling the kingdom, regardless of the price we are willing to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not have a commercialized mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reward of the kingdom is altogether a matter of the Lord's gracious doing according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that none of us are good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we must be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as we are concerned, there is no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what is impossible with us is possible with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We simply need to give up the entanglements, frustrations, and distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must forsake all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we should never think that what we give up constitutes the price we pay to purchase the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever we do or give constitutes nothing and amounts to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Never think that you can buy the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do need to give up all frustrations and entanglements, but the Lord will not give us the kingdom as a commercial transaction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The kingdom comes to us from the Lord's gracious giving according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to prove that the kingdom is not a matter of commerce but of the Lord's gracious giving, He will reward the last first and the first last.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will give the reward of the kingdom first to those who were called last.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In all of these chapters we have said a great deal about the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of you may be discouraged, thinking this is too hard and too high for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Or, along with Peter, you may be thinking that one day you may be able to purchase the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both thoughts are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must realize that by ourselves we can never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must put all our trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With us it is impossible; with God it is altogether possible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Never consider that what you have given up to follow the Lord amounts to the price that will purchase the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord will give you the reward of the kingdom as an act of goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It comes from the Lord's gracious giving.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Never think of the kingdom in a commercial way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Give up the commercialized mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have seen the principle revealed in this parable, we will be very much encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is impossible with me, but it is absolutely possible with Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The kingdom is not something that we can buy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a matter of the Lord's gracious giving.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We simply cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If He calls us, we just answer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If He asks us to follow Him, we follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If He asks us to give up something, we will rid ourselves of all entanglements, frustrations, and distractions in order to go along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we give up means nothing and amounts to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The kingdom is priceless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is the Lord's gracious gift.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will give the kingdom to us by His will and by His goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am very happy to tell you that we may be the laborers called at five o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may be the last group to be called into the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now we are here working for God's eternal purpose, for God's kingdom.</S>
