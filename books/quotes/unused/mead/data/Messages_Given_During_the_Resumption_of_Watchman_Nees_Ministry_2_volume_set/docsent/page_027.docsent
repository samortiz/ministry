   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paying the Price to Forsake Everything</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many preachers tell others that if a person believes in the Lord he will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They tell others that the Lord is the blessing, and that with Him there is the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, to be a Christian costs one's life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Christian is one who is blind, who gives up money and position, and who would rather have his own feeling hurt than offend the Lord's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is one who is willing to give up everything to gain the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All those who are not willing to go on in this way are merely "pew-Christians."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All "pew-Christians" are Christians who will not go on in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OUR HUMAN LIVING BEING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A MATTER OF GOD WORKING IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mrs. Chow asked:Should we obey our parents if they charge us to do something contrary to the Lord? If we disobey them, are we dishonoring them?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Allowing God to Touch Us</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>in Our Human Relationships</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Lee answered:Do not be an analyzing Christian or a rehearsing Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not need to analyze or rehearse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever your inner feeling, you should simply act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the feeling inside tells you that you cannot obey your parents, you should not obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament, God ordered Abraham to kill his son, and the Levites to kill their brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They would not have committed a sin if they killed those God ordered them to kill.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you go along with God's feeling, you are pleasing God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it is not God's intention for you merely to please Him, but it is His intention to mingle His life with yours.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's emphasis is not that we work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not we do the right thing is immaterial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What God is after is that in our obeying of Him, He gains the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wants to transmit the "electricity" to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His intention is to put some "gold" on you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention for us to be rebellious children or submissive children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has no intention for us to be evil persons or good persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What God wants is that we allow Him to touch us in our human relationships, in the relationship between parents and children, and between husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wants to put Himself into us in the same way that gold is coated onto an object through a plating process.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mrs. Chow asked:If my mother-in-law asks me to buy a joss stick for her, should I do it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Lee answered:If you do not feel peaceful within, you should not buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is always a price to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not pay this price, you will feel sorry for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Allowing God's Element to Increase</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>in Our Daily Living</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you take every opportunity to learn the lesson, in the end you will become a person who is saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will become a person who lives out God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has put you in various positions, within your family and in your job.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does so in order that you would allow Him to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not care for the success of your career.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What He cares for is that through everything He would gain the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you have been a good wife for five years, yet God has never increased in you, but has instead decreased in you, you are worth nothing in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the five years that you have been a wife, daily you should have allowed God time and time again to anoint you with His desire, His heart, and even Himself, so that you would have His element within, and that this element would increase all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what God is after.</S>
