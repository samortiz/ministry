   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Growing with the Increase of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of assimilation is a good illustration of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately after eating, the fine work of dispensing begins in order to dispense the food into the cells, fibers, and tissues of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, the dispensing of the Triune God is to make the processed and consummated Triune God the very constitution of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This fine work of dispensing continues day by day and will be finalized when the sealing ink of the Spirit permeates through our entire body Eph 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will be the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 when we are glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The dispensing of the Triune God into us causes us to grow with the increase of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For anything to grow it must increase with some element or substance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Human beings grow by the food they take in. If you do not eat anything, you cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We Christians grow with the increase, the surplus, the addition, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God entered into us when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now He is increasing within us by adding more of Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the amount of God each brother or sister has differs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have the Lord increase within us, we must come to the Word of God to eat each day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first stanza of Hymns, #811 shows how we must come to the Lord to be fed by Him:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All that I need is none other but Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also must pray in order to be fed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times, I do not have the time to close my door, kneel down, and pray, but I can say that I often have a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have a kind of aspiration within me, and this aspiration causes me to breathe the Lord in very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It causes me to inhale the living, processed, consummated God into my being.</S>
