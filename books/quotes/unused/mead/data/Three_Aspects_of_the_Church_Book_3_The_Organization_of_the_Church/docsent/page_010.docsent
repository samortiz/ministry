   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the brothers and sisters who are arranged to serve should not consider that since it is the arrangement of the elders, they should simply obey.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is to submit to the authority of man, not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should all realize that in the church God has the authority, Christ is the Head, and the elders are but God s deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We obey the elders because we submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not submitting to the authority of man but to Christ, the Head of the church, recognizing His authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are two kinds of submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When some people submit to authority, a person can sense that they are submissive, but when others submit, their submission has the flavor of Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, some people are humble; however, a person can sense only that they are humble and that there is no flavor of Christ in their humility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In contrast, the humility of others has the flavor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we submit to someone merely because he is an elderly brother or because he is an elder, this will give people only the taste of submission, not the taste of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, when we submit to the elderly brothers and the elders based on God having the authority and Christ being the Head of the church, our submission to them is the result of our submission to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The flavor is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can solemnly testify that the submission of some brothers and sisters causes us to fear God, because in their submission we touch Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these saints submit to the brothers, they cause the brothers to fear God, because the brothers touch the authority of the Head in their submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may say, If this is the case, should not these brothers be occupying a higher position?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be clear that this thought is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This thought is despicable and offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether one is a deputy authority or one who submits to a deputy authority, if a person truly knows the authority of the Head, he will enable others to touch Christ the Head in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The young brothers and sisters may be too young in the Lord to be in a position of representing authority, but if they truly know the authority of the Head and submit to those who represent authority, they will cause others to sense Christ the Head in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, others will sense the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will sense the authority of the Head not in those to whom the young people submit but in the young people themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will cause those who observe the young people to have a heart that fears the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord can testify for me that a number of times I have observed this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, I truly have the fear of the Lord within me because I have touched His authority in the submission of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should never consider this matter as the submission of subordinates to superiors such as occurs in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although that kind of submission has its value and we appreciate it, submission as related to the organization of the Body far surpasses the submission found in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is most offensive to the Lord for a person in the church to make arrangements concerning a certain matter or person without inwardly touching the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should never have an opinion or make an arrangement outside the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To do so is offensive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BEING ACCORDING TO ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The organization of the church is according to life, the authority of God, function, and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition, the organization of the church is according to order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Order is related to authority; nevertheless, there is a distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen that the organization of the church is not two-dimensional but three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As types of the church, both a building and a human body are three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more three-dimensional a church is, the stronger it is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A weak church is a flat church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The flatter it is, the weaker it is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a church is flat, it has no usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there are one hundred brothers and sisters in a church and nearly all are the same, this church is flat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A flat object, such as a flat metal sheet, often does not have much usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if a bucket, a three-dimensional object, was formed from the metal sheet, it would become very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order for a church with one hundred brothers and sisters to function properly, there is a need for a clear order among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One should be here and another there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When all are in the proper order, that church becomes functional as a three-dimensional entity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be three-dimensional is to have an order, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12:28: First apostles, second prophets, third teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is an order.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A proper family or couple can never be flat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the husband and wife occupy the same position, they cannot represent a proper human relationship, much less be a proper type of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, if children and parents are on the same level, occupying the same position, this would be an ugly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The condition of some churches is flat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The flat condition is due to an arrangement according to organization, not according to Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can discern whether or not the organization of a church is according to Spirit and life by seeing whether the church is three-dimensional and has a proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether thirty people or three hundred people are gathered together, there should be order.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, in every service in the church, there should be an order.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There needs to be an order among those who sweep the floors and wipe the tables and among those who cook and set the tables for the love feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When every service is three-dimensional, this is a beautiful scene.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church of God is like a body in which every bone must be joined to another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every member must be coordinated with another member.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Consequently, some members occupy a higher position, and others occupy a lower position.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is most foolish if some in the church would contend and ask why they occupy a lower position than others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In a human body, would it not be foolish for the feet to insist on occupying the same position as the eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Likewise, in the Body it is foolish to compete or contend for a higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this matter, we all need the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a proper church a person can touch life and authority, and he can see function and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moreover, he can see that the church is three-dimensional and has order.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This order comes from the previous four items: life, authority, function, and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Order is not the result of someone saying that one person is above a second and under a third.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This kind of order is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If Paul had spoken in this way, it would have indicated that he was a person who knew neither God s life nor God s authority and had neglected function and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a co-worker knows life, authority, function, and ministry and if based upon these matters he tells a church that a certain brother is an elder, all those who fear and love the Lord will bow their heads and say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not man s arrangement but something according to life, authority, function, and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more those in the church experience life, submit to the authority of the Lord, manifest their functions, and some among them carry out their particular ministry, the more there will be order and the less there will be chaos in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When a church is facing a problem, we should not speak too much but should simply say, O Lord, let the elders be clear concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that we have to keep the order and recognize that the problem is the responsibility of the elders, not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If someone sees that all the brothers and sisters are in order in the church, he will bow his head and worship, saying, Indeed, God is among you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Likewise, when we see a church in which everyone is in order, we also will surely bow our head and worship the Lord for His presence among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope that we would not receive these matters as doctrines or merely apply them to others; rather, we should apply them to ourselves and soberly put them into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>ALL PROBLEMS BEING THE RESULT</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>OF NOT KEEPING THE ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In 1948 after the victory in the Sino-Japanese War many of our brothers and sisters moved to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Due to the Lord s sovereign arrangement, many senior brother co-workers were not in Shanghai at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As a result, the decisions regarding many important matters fell upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Among us there were several sister co-workers who had learned much and who kept their proper place in the order.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They kept the proper order to such an extent that I desired to be a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is wonderful to be a sister because a sister can check with the brothers concerning every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should not think that it is comfortable to be in a higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The most comfortable thing is for a person to stand in the position that the Lord has given him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If he remains in his position, he will be satisfied and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should not think that it is more satisfying to direct people to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Being satisfied and at ease is not a matter of directing people or being directed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It altogether depends upon whether or not we keep the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Some people may ask, How do we know if we are in the proper order?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>One who asks such a question demonstrates that he is not in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Every believer knows whether or not he is in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many brothers are not at rest in regard to their position.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They are not inwardly satisfied and have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In contrast, in my family I have several children, and they all know who is the oldest, the second oldest, and the third.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Because they all know their respective positions, they are inwardly satisfied, pleased, and at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Many people have no rest in their service because their heart is not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They are not content with the place assigned to them by God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Consequently, they are neither pleased nor at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If the organization of a church is according to life, the authority of God, function, and ministry, and has a three-dimensional order, the church will be strong and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The coordination and organization within the church must be according to life, the authority of God, function, ministry, and order.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only when all five requirements are met will the organization of the church be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We do not deny that the church has organization, but we must determine that the organization of the church is according to these five matters.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All the arrangement and coordination in the church must be according to life, authority, function, ministry, and order.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must be strict in regard to these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We should not speak these words only to others; we need to speak them to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Every one of us must consider his own situation.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Instead of taking these words as doctrines, each of us should use them to realistically examine our personal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Our present concern is that the church will become a dead organization.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Rather than correcting this matter with our human hand, may we look to the Holy Spirit to work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The Roman Catholic Church and the degraded Protestant churches have fallen into their present condition because they have problems in regard to these five matters.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>On our part we must always ask the Lord, Am I in my proper place in the church with respect to my portion?</S>
