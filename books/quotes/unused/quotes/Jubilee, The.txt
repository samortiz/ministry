In the early days, some of the Western missionaries who came to China knew the Bible in its original Hebrew and Greek languages
After their arrival in China, they learned the Chinese language and desired to translate the Bible into Chinese
As they were translating the Bible, each of the missionaries would retain a top Chinese scholar as his assistant
Whenever they encountered a word or phrase that did not exist in Chinese, they had to invent a new word or phrase
Many people do not realize the difficulties encountered in translating the Bible into Chinese in the early days
At that time the children of Israel had been redeemed and delivered by God out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage
Formerly, they had fallen into the land of Egypt and were serving as slaves under Pharaoh, having neither freedom nor an inheritance
Egypt typifies the world; Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, typifies Satan; and the children of Israel typify God's people enslaved in the world
The Lord Jesus as our real Moses was sent by God to deliver us out of the land of slavery into Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey
Both milk and honey are produced by a combination of two kinds of lives, the animal life and the vegetable life
The phrase milk and honey indicates that the good land is full, not of snakes and beasts, but of cattle, bees, grass, and flowers
That the good land flows with milk and honey indicates that this land is full of the animal life and the plant life
All this signifies that Christ as the good land is full of life, rich to the uttermost, to be our supply for our enjoyment
The descendants of Joseph received a double portion through Manasseh and Ephraim, while the tribe of Levi received no inheritance of land
Because of this, the translators of the Chinese Bible struggled to invent the Chinese term hsi-nien, the year of jubilee, to describe it
As we have seen, the Israelites were redeemed by God; they left Egypt, journeyed through the wilderness, and entered into Canaan
After entering into the land of Canaan, each family received a portion of the good land flowing with milk and honey for their rich enjoyment
If the land had been sold permanently, in just a few generations there would have been an extreme disparity between the rich and the poor
God told the Israelites The land shall not be sold into permanent ownership for the land is Mine for you are aliens and sojourners with Me
They were not to sell their portion of land, the possession that they had received from God, into permanent ownership
After a man sold his land, in the fiftieth year, the year of jubilee, he as the original owner would receive back his land
As a type in the Old Testament, the year of jubilee is recorded in Leviticus 25, and as a prophecy it is found in Isaiah 61
The inheritance spoken of in the Bible is the inheritance among the saints to be received by all those who believe into the Lord
After God created Adam, He did not say much to him; He simply indicated that He wanted Adam to receive Him to be his real possession
When considering human society, we may divide human beings into three categories: optimists, pessimists, and those in between
Many optimists are dreamers and persons without sobriety, and they are filled with imaginations about everything
After getting their degree, they work even harder so they can get married, have a family, and build up a career
Whether rich or poor, noble or base, civilized or barbaric, everyone is the same; all have no hope and are without God
Some people have sold themselves to sinful things, such as extravagant eating and drinking, sexual indulgence, gambling, and drug addiction
After marriage, however, they discover that instead of obtaining freedom they have entered a new kind of slavery
Not only the unbelievers, but even many who are believers are still not wholly delivered from the slavery under Pharaoh
In the year of jubilee there are two main blessings: the returning of every man to his lost possession and the liberation from slavery
If we want to be truly free and able to enjoy God as our possession, we must receive the Lord Jesus as the real jubilee in us
In 2 Corinthians 6:2, Paul says, 'Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation'
Paul exhorts us to receive the Lord right away because now is the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee
In Philippians 4, Paul indicates that he knew Christ and experienced Him to such an extent that everything was to his satisfaction
In the age of the Old Testament, which was the age of law before the coming of Christ, man was in the position of a slave
We may say that 'the year of jubilee' refers to the age of the jubilee, not just to one year, the fiftieth year
The year of jubilee is Christ therefore the year of jubilee is the year of grace because grace is God Himself in Christ to be our enjoyment
From then on, at any time and in any matter, in dealing with anyone or anything, if we live by Christ, Christ is our jubilee
In typology the jubilee lasted a year, but in fulfillment it refers to the entire New Testament age and the millennium
In that year every owner was returned to his lost possession, and everyone who had sold himself as a slave regained his freedom
The children of Israel fell from the good land into Egypt, the land of slavery, and eventually they lost everything
According to this picture, as fallen mankind we have lost our possession, and we have also sold ourselves, becoming slaves who own nothing
In the jubilee, all things are pleasant and satisfying to our heart, and we are free from anxiety, at ease, excited, and exultant
The Hebrew word for jubilee is yobel, which means a joyful noise, a shouting with the blasting of a trumpet, and a proclamation
When God led them out of Egypt, He performed a great miracle by separating the waters of the sea for them to pass through
When they crossed the Red Sea and saw their enemies drowned and buried, they were in ecstasy, shouting and dancing for joy
We should not remain in oldness, embracing the traditional way of Christianity, the way of having a Sunday morning service in a rigid manner
The Chinese translators dared not translate it in this way and therefore rendered it as 'shout for joy unto the Lord'
They could not discern the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of weeping, for the people shouted with a loud shout
Some may ask, 'Doesn't 1 Corinthians 14:40 say that in the meetings all things should be done becomingly and in order'?
When the jubilee came, millions of Israelites made a joyful noise in a loud and spontaneous way, shouting with joy, even at the same time
On the one hand, we rejoice and make a joyful noise, but on the other hand, we are soberminded, exercising restraint
They began to sell what they owned, and even after selling their land, they eventually had to sell themselves as slaves
If someone had sold his land, he would be returned to his land, and if someone had sold himself as a slave, he would regain his freedom
At the arrival of the fiftieth year, there was no more selling of land or of persons; every household had a portion of land once more
Every fifty years there was a balance of the ownership of the land; this was the fairest way to deal with the land
The Lord is the tree of life and the river of life; he who believes into Him eats and drinks Him and is satisfied
God presented the tree of life to Adam, but Adam did not take it; hence, he lost his portion of the enjoyment of God
From kings and presidents to street sweepers and beggars, everyone is a prodigal son who has become penniless and who lives with 'hogs'
For the sake of society, their relatives, and their friends, they are not reckless outwardly, but they are still reckless in their mind
Although they may live in high-rise buildings or large mansions, within them there is no rest, no dwelling place
To be saved is to return to our inheritance, to return to God, to come back to God and enjoy Him anew as our possession
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
Even though they have God, they are like lights that do not shine because they do not 'turn on the switch' by taking God as their portion
He had no choice but to go and join himself to a citizen of a 'distant country,' which signifies the satanic world
Pharaoh sent the people to build cities, but in this parable a citizen sent the son to feed hogs, which is worse
Building cities is a matter of sweating and making bricks, but in order to feed hogs, one has to associate with them
Eventually, the son desired to eat the carob pods which the hogs ate, yet even then his hunger was not satisfied
According to spiritual significance, this story depicts a fallen man who completely lost his possession in the house of God the Father
Today, all fallen people, regardless of their profession, whether presidents, kings, or poor beggars, are 'feeding hogs'
The most obvious result of feeding hogs is to become unclean; this indicates one's engagement in unclean things
Even if a person seems to be righteous as long as he makes money and acquires a fortune he is feeding hogs he is engaged in unclean business
Rather, this story is a picture showing us that once a fallen man leaves God, he goes to 'feed hogs,' regardless of what profession he is in
All fallen people working in society are 'wallowing in a pigpen,' although some eat better 'carob pods' than others
The jubilee is the age, the time, of God's acceptance, indicated by the father's acceptance of the prodigal son in Luke 15
In the preceding chapter we saw the possession of the jubilee, and in this message we shall see the freedom of the jubilee
Without the types of the Old Testament, we would have no way to understand the plain words of the New Testament
The Bible seems to use the 'kindergarten teaching method': the New Testament contains plain words, and the Old Testament contains pictures
In the year of jubilee we mainly do not have our possession restored to us; rather, we are returned to our possession
Today many people talk about freedom, civil rights, and human rights, but if man does not enjoy God, he cannot have real freedom
Beginning at least with the French Revolution two hundred years ago, people have been pursuing democracy in order to obtain freedom
They had to rise when they saw their fathers, grandfathers, or uncles come in the room, and they yielded their seats to them politely
Many children in former times had true freedom, while today's children have the wrong freedom, a freedom under the yoke of slavery
In the same principle, the yoke of slavery borne by many women today is worse than before because many women today do not have God
When the year of jubilee comes, however, we obtain freedom and are delivered from poverty, captivity, and oppression
Some may say that poor denotes being poor in material things, and material poverty symbolizes spiritual poverty
What Paul means by this is that if a man on earth does not have God, then whatever he enjoys apart from God is like dog food
Please remember that it is not those who do not have money who are poor; rather, it is the people who do not have God who are poor
The phrase announce the gospel to the poor in Luke 4 actually means to preach the gospel to those who are without God
Announcing the gospel to the poor does not refer to preaching the gospel to those who are poor in material things
Otherwise, millionaires, bankers, and presidents would not need the gospel, since they are not poor in material things
The accurate meaning here is that all men, whether rich or poor, honored or despised, need the gospel, and they need to gain God
All human beings, regardless of their occupation, gender, or age, are captives of Satan and are under his authority
Apparently, human beings are free, but actually in the whole world no one is free because all are captives under the authority of Satan
All the people of the world remain passively in the sphere of the evil one's influence, under the evil one's usurpation and manipulation
Sin is something intrinsic in man's being; murder and arson are merely the outward, sinful acts that are carried out and manifested
Advocates of the former asserted that man is born good, while proponents of the latter maintained that man is born evil
He said that to will to do good was present with him but to work out the good was not because someone who was stronger than him dwelt in him
As a person's will develops, he may feel that sinning is not good, and he therefore no longer wants to commit sin
When his addiction to alcohol makes its demand, he must have a drink, and when the addiction to gambling rises up, he must gamble
According to the original language of the Bible, Beelzebul means the lord of the dunghill, from the name meaning the lord of flies
As the lord of the dunghill, Satan specializes in leading flies to feed on dung; hence, he is also the lord of flies
Beelzebul can disguise himself with a high-class appearance so that all the 'flies' following him appear to be of a high class
After he captured us, he entered into us as Beelzebul, the lord of flies, and began leading us about to commit sins
One who becomes angry at someone and then can immediately get over his anger may be considered to be a sage and a virtuous man
Logically, as saved ones, the saints, we should surpass the sages and virtuous ones, but can we quickly get over our anger?
Perhaps a person may be one who has learned the lessons well and is able to come back to the Lord and calm his anger
Wood and stones do not become angry, but no human being can avoid getting angry; only dead people do not get angry
How we thank God for Romans 8:2, which says that in Christ the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and of death!
Many can testify that when they get angry, they can get over it very quickly, and the anger does not come back
In the first chapter, we saw that the Lord has come to bring in the New Testament age as the age of the jubilee
Paul said that all things were lawful to him, but he would not be brought under the power of anything to be its slave
The poor are ruled by poverty, while the rich are ruled by money; the Chinese expression for miser refers to one who is a slave of money
The jubilee is to return those who are poor and who have lost God back to God as their possession, and it is also to proclaim release
Today in the age of democracy people greatly promote freedom, but the result is that they have very little freedom
People continually talk about liberty and seek for freedom, but eventually they are bound and restricted in every way
If we do not pursue freedom, we may enjoy some amount of freedom, but the more we talk about freedom, the more we lose it
The jubilee is a type in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament it is fulfilled in all those who believe in the Lord
All things of the human life are vanity, like pursuing after shadows and chasing after wind; they are fleeting and short-lived
Having had the experience of human life, he said that we bring all the years of our life to an end as with a sigh
Even when they sing, they cannot sing for too long, because eventually their song becomes a dirge or a lamentation
Moses said, 'It is soon gone, and we fly away,' whereas Solomon said, 'All is vanity and a chasing after wind'
It seems to them that even though they are seeking the Lord and loving Him, they end up receiving plagues and chastisements
Once he went into the sanctuary, received the enlightenment, and carefully considered this matter, he understood
She could not comfort Job even a little on the contrary she provoked him saying in effect See you fear God yet what do you end up with
Had Job not encountered this stripping and suffering, his experience and enjoyment of God could not have been as great
The book of James in the New Testament says that we need to consider the experience of Job and remember how he endured
Whether or not something is to our satisfaction does not depend on the environment; it depends on whether or not God is there
What Job encountered in his life was very difficult, but he was still satisfied, and he could still worship and praise
If we do not have the Lord as our 'mast,' the 'boat' of our human life is unstable and can be easily overturned
They think that although there are sufferings in their human life, when they believe in Jesus, they will have peace in their environment
What the gospel says is that we as fallen ones have all kinds of suffering because we have lost God and do not have Him within
After receiving the Lord, some who were gravely ill prayed continually to the Lord for healing, yet the Lord never healed them
A number of people had been healed of their diseases simply by means of handkerchiefs or aprons carried away from Paul's body
When everything is calm and peaceful, we seldom think of enjoying God and know very little about experiencing the Lord
Only when we fall into sufferings can we be humbled to trust the Lord wholeheartedly, call on Him, and enjoy Him
A small child is comfortable, warm, and satisfied in his mother's bosom, but sooner or later he has to be weaned
He does not take the foolish children-He leaves them with us to make trouble-but He may take those who are clever, capable, and comforting
Apparently, it seems that God hurts us by taking away what we love and what, apparently, should not be taken away
It does not mean that we should not be proper parents raising our children rather we should properly fulfill our responsibilities as parents
All these are just the duties of our human life; they should not become an encumbrance or a bondage to enslave us
If we do not have God as our primary factor within, we cannot avoid being under the bondage of these persons, things, and matters
When choosing a partner for marriage, our attention should not be focused on marriage, as an encumbering burden, but on God
Even if everything seems to be right at the time of his choosing, once he is married, he may feel that he chose the wrong person
Those who study history see the extent of the confusion among people in the world and often say that human life is hopeless
All these are not our burdens; on the contrary, they are working for us that we may be perfected to enjoy the Lord even more
A Christian's life of jubilee should be a life of fully enjoying the Lord, a life that is full of joy and praises
If our heart is set on anything other than the Lord, that thing, whether good or bad, becomes a suffering to us
Whether bad things or good things, whether poverty or riches, whether being educated or uneducated, all are sufferings
That is why Paul said that 'as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
