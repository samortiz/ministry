   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Recent Condition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Brother Liu Ai-wu, Ch'ang-sha</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church in Ch'ang-sha has not had a local person raised up to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot release my burden for the meetings, so I feel that I should remain in Ch'ang-sha temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi wanted me to completely drop everything regarding the meetings in Ch'ang-sha when I was in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He asked me whether I could go to Hankow to help with the Gospel Book Room and to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, I do not have any inward leading to take his suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ministry which I have received from the Lord is to serve the orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord has not yet given me a vision concerning this work, yet I have had the faith to do it all along.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times the brothers have seen that the burden of caring for my family is heavy and have exhorted me to do some other work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now some brothers exhort me that it would be better for me to get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet I was not touched.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Glory be to our rich Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since He led me to leave the orphanage, the flour in my jar and the oil in my pitcher have never run short.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With regard to my health, I had a relapse of my illness in July of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I spent more than a month recovering and have not had a relapse since.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My condition seems to be much improved from last year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brother from Chi-Loo University an internist gave me a physical examination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could not see any sign of tuberculosis during his careful examination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my working and moving about, I have found my physical strength much weaker than before.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I used to walk nineteen to twenty-two miles a day and work the entire day without feeling tired.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now I find it difficult to walk for three miles, and I must rest after working for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not know what attitude I should have toward my health, the church, and my future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am telling you these things with the hope that you will render me help with your direct words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Liu Ai-wu</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A Letter from Brother Han Fu-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>during His Illness</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was transferred from Ren-Shu Hospital to Siang-Ya Hospital five days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything is progressing well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because my illness is so peculiar, I had to go through many tests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This has been a real suffering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At first the doctors said that I had a tumor in my lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then they thought that water in my lungs had made my chest swell.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have attempted to draw off fluid many times, but with no result.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Last night they discovered a pocket of pus under my ribs when they poked me with a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Surgery is a necessity now.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ask the Lord to give me grace to get through this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My heart is still peaceful and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am resting in the Lord's bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have given everything to the Lord, so I have nothing to be anxious about.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I deeply believe that whatever happens to me is the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He would not allow me to suffer unnecessarily!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My mouth praises the Lord unceasingly for giving me an opportunity to enjoy His grace and love more!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
