<p>There are two principles of examination: our person and our burden. First, we need to see who we are; then we need to consider what we want to do. On the positive side, we must see a clear vision concerning God&rsquo;s will. Not only do we need to see God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, but we also need to see God&rsquo;s purpose in this age, that is, what God wants to accomplish today. On the negative side, we need to know the part of Christianity that is constructive and the part that is destructive. We need to see all these matters clearly so that we will know what the degree of our involvement should be. This is not a simple matter. Therefore, whether or not we should be involved in a certain work depends on our person and then on our burden and attitude. What kind of work do we justify, and what kind of work do we condemn? There may be a constructive aspect, but if the destructive aspect is even greater, we must make the choice cautiously.</p>
<p>As the brother teaching at the National Taiwan University indicated, he has a problem related to the ground of the church. We have seen that God&rsquo;s intention is related to the local ground, and we must be firm in this matter. Once brothers and sisters partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table on this ground, something within them requires them to be separated from and not participate in the divisive and destructive work of Christianity. Even though our brother at the National Taiwan University loves the Lord and has the burden to do a particular work for the Lord, he is not clear concerning the local ground; thus, we are hesitant to labor with him.</p>
<p>For the sake of avoiding argument, we feel to let him make the decision with whom to labor. May the Lord lead him to receive a clear vision of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and also to see the extent to which God disapproves of the condition of Christianity. At that time, we will not only confirm but also encourage him in his work; nevertheless, because this is not yet his condition, it is difficult for us to give him a confirming word. Since the brother has doubts concerning the ground of locality, how can we confirm his work? We do not have the peace to do so, and he also has nothing to say.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORKING FOR THE LORD<br />
REQUIRING OBEDIENCE TO THE LORD&rsquo;S TRUTH</h2>
<p>After our fellowship with the brother, his wife said that although she was not altogether clear concerning the matter of the ground, she was willing to learn to submit to the church and to the authority of the church. Moreover, she was willing to serve and do things under the direction of the brothers. Although she was not clear, she was still willing to obey. Unlike his wife, however, this brother said that he would not submit to the church but would obey only God.</p>
<p>In regard to the authority of the church, our principle is that we do not require others to obey us; however, a person who works for the Lord should always obey the Lord&rsquo;s truths. We should obey God, yet we should also obey His truths. Otherwise, we are not worthy to be the Lord&rsquo;s workers or to work for Him.</p>
<p>To which truth do we refer? We refer to the truth regarding God&rsquo;s desire to obtain a Body for His Son and to gain a house for Himself. Practically, God desires to have a group of Christians in every locality as a corporate expression of the Body of Christ and as His house. We cannot deny this truth. In this light, are we able to affirm that the many Christian groups in the different localities are such an expression? I do not believe that anyone would affirm this. Since we cannot affirm that these Christian groups are such an expression, is it possible to have such an expression? We need to believe that God&rsquo;s word is never spoken in vain. What He says, He will fulfill. Therefore, in principle, when we go to a certain place, we should first look for such an expression. This is according to the truth.</p>
<p>The building up of the church in a locality is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. We should not think that this is impossible to achieve, simply because Christianity is in a state of great confusion. God always means business, and He never says that He will do anything that He cannot attain. This brother said that the expression of the church can be only temporary and cannot be eternal. This is altogether a rhetorical argument. I have said only that the local ground of the church is <em>for</em> the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose; I never said that it <em>is</em> God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Even if we eliminated the word <em>eternal</em> and simply said that the expression of the local church is for the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, we would still need to take care of this matter because it is related to the Lord&rsquo;s purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Ground of the Church and the Service of the Body &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
