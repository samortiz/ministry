   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THE HUMAN LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE BY OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the six chapters of Ephesians, our spirit must be enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation; this is the beginning of God s dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit must also be strengthened so that Christ may gain more ground to take possession of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This spirit becomes the spirit of our mind to take over, subdue, and control our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we need to be filled in our spirit and pray at every time in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have such a spirit, we will have no problems with the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a husband and wife have a spirit that is always enlightened by God and full of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that is the dwelling place of God, a strengthened spirit that always gives Christ more ground within them, a spirit that takes possession of their mind, a spirit that is filled, and a praying spirit, they will have no problems in their marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the problems among the married couples come only when they are out of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was younger, brothers and sisters would come to me with the troubles of their marriage life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time I always told them to open their Bible to Ephesians 5:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They already received the teaching from this passage on their wedding day, but I would try my best to remind them of it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every time I did this, I failed myself and I failed them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I failed in this way for a period of many years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually I learned that such teaching does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is another verse in Ephesians 5, verse 18, which says, Be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their problem was that they were out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they would simply return to the spirit, open to the Lord, and speak to Him, their problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HAVING THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO PRACTICE RELATEDNESS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A marriage life is a related life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times a husband does not tell his wife before he goes somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes wives also act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because they have not realized that after being married, they now have a related life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After getting married, a husband must not only tell his dear wife where he is going, but he may also need to ask her permission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to be a good husband or wife, one must always go to his or her spouse before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To keep the relatedness in this way removes all the misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It causes the family life to be full of joy and the husbands and wives to be happy with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, the church life is also a related life, an enlarged marriage life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we all need to learn to be related.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, whenever we are in our mind, we are separated, not related.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Relatedness can be realized only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not mere knowledge; it is something practical for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes we may say, Let us come together and thoroughly discuss the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may help in a small way, but we need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we talk in the mind, the more problems we have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have a problem, the secret is to say, Brothers, let us stop our talking and pray a little.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to stop the exercise of the mind and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To pray is to come back to the spirit and exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After everyone prays, we are restored to oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we come back to the spirit, we are immediately in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may again illustrate this with the marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever husbands and wives are not happy with each other, they are in the soul, either the mind or the emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The problem is never with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The best way to help the situation is for them to turn from the mind and the emotions to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they turn to the spirit, they will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a husband is in his mind or emotion, he looks at his wife from the angle of the mind and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you look at my face from the front, you can see my eyes, but when you look from behind, you see only my hair.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same principle, if a brother looks at his wife from the point of view of his mind, he will quickly become unhappy with her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when he turns to his spirit, he looks at his wife from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His view is different because his angle has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times we have problems with the dear ones in the church life simply because we exercise our mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we exercise our mind to look at the brothers and sisters, the more problems we have.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to turn to our spirit whenever we have any problem with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should say, Lord, help me not to look at my brothers and sisters in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Help me to turn to the spirit and consider the saints from my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we will see from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The situation will still be the same, but our view will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason it is easy to be angry with people is that we are too much in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we turn to the spirit, however, our angle will change, so our view of the saints will be different.</S>
