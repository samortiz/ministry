   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TABERNACLED AMONG US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tent of meeting brings God to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is no longer in the heavens; He is here in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ enlarged as the tent of meeting brings God to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word "dwelt" in Greek means "tabernacled."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He as the Word was God, and one day this Word became flesh to tabernacle among us and bring God from heaven to earth in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today God is in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is clearly seen in 1 Corinthians 14 where people coming into the tent of meeting of the local church say "that God is among you indeed" v. 25, ASV . God today is in the tent of meeting, and this tent of meeting is just Christ enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ enlarged brings God to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is only one part.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not only the tent of meeting; He is also all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the tabernacle, and He is also all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tabernacle brings God to man, and the offerings bring man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not one-way traffic, but coming and going in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ comes as the tabernacle, and Christ goes as the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ comes to us with God, and Christ goes back to God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, by His coming He brings God to us, and by His going He brings us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are sinful, but Christ as the tabernacle has brought God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also need Christ as the offerings to bring us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The shekinah glory of God is in the tent of meeting, but how can we approach it?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as the offerings brings us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the tabernacle, Christ is the means by which God is joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the tabernacle cannot be mingled with us, but only joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Christ as the offerings can be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the offerings are to be eaten and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By assimilation, the food is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The offerings are so that Christ can be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this we have more subjective experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is not merely joined to us, but mingled and blended with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said in John 6:57, "he who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After eating a chicken, the chicken becomes a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Leviticus, nearly all the offerings are good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever we offer to God is God's food as well as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way that Christ brings us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A PRESENT TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is now in the tent of meeting, but we need to present Christ as all the offerings that we may contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word "offer" according to Darby's New Translation should be "present."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to present Christ to God as all kinds of presents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ as the offering is a kind of present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to present to God the burnt offering present, the meal offering present, the peace offering present, the sin offering present, and the trespass offering present.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if we are going to present something, we must first possess it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must pay the price and get whatever we need in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times we come to the meetings without any present for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why we need to labor on Christ all the day long in order to have some good produce.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we can bring something to present to God as a present.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not that God is demanding something from us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only desires that we would give Him a present of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are only fulfilling a demand, it is not so pleasing, but if we offer a present, how sweet and pleasant it is to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has no requirements for us in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He only wants us to present Him with something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the only present that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today God is seeking the true worshippers who worship Him in spirit and in reality John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is the reality of all the presents that we must present to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we must feed on Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must eat Him in order to have Him mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we are one with Christ, and He becomes the very present that we present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will satisfy God and it will also satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we will see the richness and the fullness of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is exactly what the church life in the meetings should be like.</S>
