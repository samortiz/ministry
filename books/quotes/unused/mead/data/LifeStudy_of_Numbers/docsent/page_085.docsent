   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Make Propitiation before God,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So That the Person Would Be Forgiven</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The priest shall make propitiation before Jehovah for the person who is in ignorance, when he sins through ignorance, to make propitiation for him; and he shall be forgiven" Num 15:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without propitiation, even though God has a heart to forgive us, He has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's propitiation affords God the way to fulfill the desire of His forgiving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Person Who Did Anything</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>with a High Hand, Thus Reviling God,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being Cut Off from among the People</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is born in the land or a sojourner, reviles Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from among his people" v. 30 . To do things with a high hand is to do as one wishes without caring for others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who behave in this way utterly disregard both man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They act as if they alone existed in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On occasion we have observed such behavior in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Certain ones acted as if they were the only ones who mattered; they ignored, neglected, despised, and abandoned everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never do things with such an attitude and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>a. Such a Person Having Despised</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>the Word of God and Having Broken His Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person who does anything with a high hand "has despised the word of Jehovah and has broken His commandment" v. 31a . Such a person behaves as if there were no God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Iniquity Being upon Him</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The iniquity of the person who does anything with a high hand will be upon him v. 31b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Testament, which we all love, we are charged to enjoy Christ, to seek Christ, and to pursue Christ, but we are not shown the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The road map with all the details for the enjoyment of Christ is found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ordinances in Numbers 15 concerning how to offer Christ as the various offerings are not only for the children of Israel; in typology they are also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Old Testament is applied in the way of typology, it becomes the New Testament to us, for it becomes the map showing us the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the turmoil among the children of Israel, God was, in a sense, forced to insert the ordinances recorded in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Especially in times of turmoil we need to remember the ordinances concerning our offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These will keep us in a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we ignore these ordinances, however, we will be condemned and might even become abhorrent to God.</S>
