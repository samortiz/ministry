<h2 class="head2">4. Christ Is the Creator</h2><p>God is the Creator of all things (Gen. 1:1; 2:1-3). Since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things. This is clearly revealed in the Scripture: &#147;O my God.…Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands&#148; (Psa. 102:24-25, ASV). We have seen that this word refers to Christ. Christ is God who created heaven and earth. &#147;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being&#148; (John 1:3). &#147;Through whom are all things, and we through Him&#148; (1 Cor. 8:6). &#147;Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him&#148; (Col. 1:16). &#147;Through whom [the Son] also He [God] made the universe&#148; (Heb. 1:2).</p><p>These verses explicitly tell us that Christ is the Creator of all things; all things have been created and came into being through Him.</p><h2 class="head2">5. Christ Is a Creature</h2><p>Man is a creature (Gen. 1:27; Acts 17:26). Since Christ is man, surely He is also a creature. This is revealed in the following two verses.</p><p>Colossians 1:15 says the Son is &#147;Firstborn of all creation.&#148; This tells us in plain words that Christ is created. He is the Firstborn of the creation, the First of all creatures.</p><p>In Revelation 3:14 Christ calls Himself &#147;the beginning of the creation of God.&#148; This also tells us He is created, the chief of the creation, the first One of all creatures.</p><p>In some translations, the above two passages do not match the meaning in the original Greek text (the Chinese Version is an example of this). Some do not understand these two passages properly; hence, they deny that Christ is created. However numerous authoritative versions such as the King James Version, American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, Amplified New Testament, Interlinear Greek-English New Testament, Conybeare’s Translation, Wuest’s, Darby’s New Translation, Concordant Version, and the Berkeley Version translate Colossians 1:15 either: &#147;the firstborn of every creature,&#148; or &#147;the firstborn of all creation.&#148; According to the original text, this translation is correct. Based on the proper translation, &#147;the firstborn of all creation,&#148; in 1934 Brother Watchman Nee delivered the following word: &#147;In creation the Son is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15),  and the beginning of the creation of God (Rev. 3:14). According to His eternal plan and before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son become flesh and accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:20). In God’s plan the Son was the first in creation&#148; (The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Vol. 11, p. 734).</p>
