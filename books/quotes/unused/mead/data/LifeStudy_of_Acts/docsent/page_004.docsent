   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospels we have the unveiling of a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Person is the eternal God, the One called by the name Jehovah in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the Creator of the entire universe and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 3:15 He prophesied that one day He would become a seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That promise went unfulfilled until the expiration of the first four thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the Lord Jesus came as the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He came as the very God conceived in the womb of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to realize this, and we have emphasized this in the Life-study of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The almighty God, the eternal Jehovah, the Creator of the universe, was conceived in the womb of a virgin and was born of that virgin to be a Person with two natures the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that He was born as the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Him we see God with His divine nature and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Him we also see man in the human nature and with all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in this one Person we can see both the complete God and a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the God-man, the Lord Jesus lived a life that was the life of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this man lived by God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may even say that He lived God; He expressed God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the book of Luke we see a man living on earth full of the human virtues, yet He expressed the divine nature with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With this One God was expressed in a human being, for the life He lived was the mingling of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His life was a blending of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one before the Lord Jesus had ever lived such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of life had never been in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the Lord s life was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this life we see the blending, the mingling, of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and in this life He ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, His ministry was simply His living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His living was His ministry to accomplish what had been prophesied and typified concerning Him in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Having lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus knew that it was necessary for Him to go to Mount Moriah and accomplish His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord did not die an ordinary death; on the contrary, He died an extraordinary death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This extraordinary death was all-inclusive, and it accomplished everything God required to clear up the universe, terminate the old creation, and bring the old creation with Him into His tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the entire universe was buried with Christ in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After terminating the old creation, the Lord, on the one hand, rested in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, while He was resting in His fleshly body, He was working in His spirit in Hades 1 Pet 3:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Hades He proclaimed God s victory over His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, after accomplishing in full God s purpose through His all-inclusive death, Christ walked out of death and rose up from the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way He became the resurrected Savior and Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, in His resurrection He became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have pointed out in the past, the Lord has shown us from the Word that this life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God reaching His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His resurrection Christ became such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 20 we see that in His resurrection Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God reaching His redeemed people, came back to His disciples in an excellent and mysterious way to breathe Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord breathed on them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These disciples were the representatives of the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Into these representatives He entered as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On another occasion the resurrected Christ told the disciples, And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And it came about that while He blessed them, He parted from them and was carried up Luke 24:50-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before His ascension to the heavens, the Lord charged His disciples, who had already received Him as the life-giving Spirit within them as life essentially, to wait until, after His ascension, He would pour Himself out upon them as the all-inclusive Spirit economically.</S>
