   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-TWO THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS ASPECTS 3</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the two foregoing messages we covered the first aspect of the kingdom, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom of God, the main and basic aspect of the kingdom, is first God s reign in a general way by power and authority and then God s reign in a particular way in the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to the second aspect of the kingdom the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. The Kingdom of the Heavens 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Ruling of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Daniel 4:26 says, The heavens do rule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This actually refers to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly rule, heaven ruling over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament a form of the word heaven is used many times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For instance, Hebrews 3:1 tells us that we are partakers of a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The concept of the book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly nature of the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, this book points out that Christ today is sitting in the heavens 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has entered into the heavens 9:24 , He has passed through the heavens 4:14 , and He has become higher than the heavens 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then Hebrews reveals to us that we have received a heavenly call.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the book of Hebrews, God s call is the heavenly call.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus is actually referring to heaven when He says, Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word translated anew can also be rendered from above, that is, from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The regenerated ones are those who have been born from above, from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, our source is not the earth but the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 15:47 and 48 say, The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first man is Adam and the second Man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the second Man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 48 the earthy refers to the first man Adam, who is earthy, and they that are earthy denotes all of Adam s descendants, who are earthy as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, the heavenly denotes the second Man Christ, who is heavenly, and they also that are heavenly denotes all the believers in Christ, who are heavenly as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first man was earthy because he was of the earth; the second Man is heavenly because He is out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Savior we have received and the divine life we have received are of the same origin, the same source, which is the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hebrews 6:4 speaks of the believers tasting of the heavenly gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heavenly gift refers to God s giving of the heavenly things, such as His forgiveness, righteousness, divine life, peace, and joy, at the time of our conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse says that we have tasted of this heavenly gift.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that from the time of our regeneration, we have had a taste for heavenly things, a heavenly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Ephesians 2:6, the believers have been seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Heavenlies here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, atmosphere, and element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are now sitting in such a heavenly sphere, condition, and situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Philippians 3:20 Paul says, Our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek word for citizenship may also be translated commonwealth or associations of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our calling, rebirth, nature, atmosphere, environment, and sphere are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we are heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before we were saved, our situation was like that of the prodigal son in Luke 15 rebellion against the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the prodigal son returned to his father, he repented and said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you v. 21 . Against heaven equals before you God the Father . Sinning against heaven is sinning before God, because God the Father is in heaven Luke 11:2 . After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have even become heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that today we are under a rule that is with the heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we shall see, this rule is in our spirit, for this rule is nothing other than the living One, Christ consummated as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This One, the life-giving Spirit, indwelling us is the heavenly rule within us, and this heavenly rule is actually the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
