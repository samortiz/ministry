   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECULAR SKILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING USEFUL FOR GOD S BUILDING ONLY IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The secular skills we gain will only be useful for God s building in resurrection, that is, after the worldly father has died and we, the learned son, have been transferred into the tribe of Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After your Tyrian father has died and your Danite mother has become widowed, you must not remain a natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything natural is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of being natural, we must exercise ourselves to be in resurrection in every aspect of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more you exercise yourself to be in resurrection, the more useful you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must be in resurrection even in your relationship with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the skills we acquire must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Years ago, I often wrote a letter two or three times because after the first writing I felt that some phrases were too natural and were not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, I destroyed the letter and began again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After exercising like this to write a letter, I would still wait a day before mailing it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My purpose in doing so was to determine whether or not that letter was truly in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must learn to do things and to have our being in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a basic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TRANSFERRED NAPHTALITE NEEDING TO COME TO KING SOLOMON IN JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hiram was fetched out of Tyre and was brought to King Solomon in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the transferred Naphtalite must be fetched out of Tyre and come to King Solomon in Jerusalem where God s building is 1 Kings 7:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>King Solomon was a type of Christ, and Jerusalem, the place where God s building was, signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today s Solomon and God s present building are both in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a very good sense, the church today is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although your Tyrian father has died, your widowed Danite mother continues to exist, and you are in resurrection, you still need to come to the church because this is where God s building is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God will not build His temple in Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although you may be very useful, if you remain in Tyre, you will be useless as far as God s building is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you remain in Tyre, you may be qualified, but your standing, your ground, will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord must fetch you out of Tyre and bring you to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If your Tyrian father dies, your Danite mother goes on living as a widow, and you are in resurrection and have come to Jerusalem, then you will be useful for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CASES OF MOSES WITH JOSHUA AND PAUL WITH TIMOTHY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You are probably familiar with the cases of Moses with Joshua Num 27:15-23 and of Paul with Timothy 1 Tim 1:1-3; 2 Tim 1:1-2, 6-8; 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses and Paul firstly became pillars themselves and later became pillar builders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses built Joshua and Paul built Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moses did not actually bring the children of Israel into the rest; Joshua, who was a pillar built up by Moses, did this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, Paul built up Timothy, and Timothy became a pillar standing to bear the church testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the cases of both Moses and Paul we see that their Tyrian fathers died.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Philippians 3, Paul, speaking of his religious background, said, What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul had learned a great deal at the feet of Gamaliel Acts 22:3 , but Gamaliel, the source of Paul s skill, had to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Paul s human existence remained.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, both Moses and Paul were in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were also fetched out of Tyre and brought to the place where God s building was.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With Moses this building was the tabernacle, and with Paul it was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>History records that Moses and Paul were more than useful in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were not only pillars; they were also pillar builders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the need in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order for this need to be met, we all must pray to the Lord, saying, Lord, for the sake of Your building, make me a pillar and a pillar builder.</S>
