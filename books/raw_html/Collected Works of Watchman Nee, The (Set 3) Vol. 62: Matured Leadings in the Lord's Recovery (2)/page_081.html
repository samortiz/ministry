<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION<br />TO YI-YANG</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 10, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION TO YI-YANG</h2><p>At the end of 1948 there was flooding around Shiao-Shan, Chekiang province. The local brothers considered this to be a sign of God's sovereign hand in urging them to migrate to other places. They began to move to Yi-Yang in Chekiang. At the beginning of 1949 the first group of brothers and sisters settled in Yi-Yang. These brothers and sisters practiced the communal life. They learned to love one another, and they dealt strictly with the flesh. Thank the Lord that He has blessed His children through their obedience to Him. The number of migrating ones increased day by day. Now the saints in Yi-Yang are contemplating a further move to two or three neighboring localities. The soil in these neighboring lands is two to four times richer than in Yi-Yang. All the brothers and sisters who have moved to Yi-Yang work with their own hands. They earn their own living with their two hands.</p><p>Nanchang is an important town in Kiangsi; it is very close to Yi-Yang. Presently, several dozen brothers and sisters are moving to Nanchang from Shanghai.</p><p>All the major cities are gospel bases for spreading the gospel to surrounding places. We have to "capture and occupy" these places as soon as possible.</p><p>The brothers and sisters who have migrated to Yi-Yang have set up a good pattern. The government radio station in Nanchang has made many public announcements, asking people everywhere to go and learn from Yi-Yang, Chu-Chi, Yin-Tang, Chao-Bin, Lung-Fu-Shan, etc.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF GOSPEL MIGRATION</h2><p>Our present way of gospel preaching is not through sending one or two missionaries to a place. The way today is the way of gospel migration by the whole church. This is like paratroopers. The whole church moves forward. In order to prepare themselves for the migration, the brothers and sisters have to pick up trades that allow them to work with their own hands. Those who are preparing for migration must learn to work with their hands, even if this means working as a barber, a tailor, or a blacksmith.</p><p>Migration can teach us many things. For example, it is not easy to practice having all things in common in the cities. But in such places as Yi-Yang and Chu-Chi, it is easy to practice having all things in common; there is no problem with such a practice.</p><p>The new government has adopted a new philosophy. The basic principle of its philosophy is the principle of equalization, but they are afraid that when everyone becomes equal, some will become lazy. This is the reason they have to keep a close eye on everyone. To the new government, equalization is something very hard to practice. But this does not pose any hardship for us, the Christians. We love one another, and we love our neighbors as ourselves. In Yi-Yang the elderly and sick ones are fed even better than the others.</p><p>The present urgent need is the spreading of the gospel. There are over two million people in the northwestern part of Kiangsi. We have only a little over two hundred brothers and sisters. This is less than a hundredth of one percent. I hope that in the near future, the gospel will spread out quickly from them.</p>
