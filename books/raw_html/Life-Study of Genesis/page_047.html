<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>bb. Christ Cast Out Demons<br>to Bring in the Kingdom of God</H2><P>The four gospels tell us that Jesus encountered demons wherever He went. Jesus could never tolerate demons and He immediately cast them out. In Matthew 12:28 Jesus tells us that His casting out the demons was the coming of the kingdom. That was the dominion of God. Adam had failed to bring in the kingdom, but when Jesus came He brought in the kingdom by casting out demons. To cast out demons means to bring in the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>cc. Christ Gave His Disciples<br>Authority over the Power of the Enemy</H2><P>Christ also gave His disciples authority over all the power of Satan. In Luke 10:19, the Lord Jesus said, "Behold I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy." Both serpents and scorpions are in plural, indicating that they are many. In verse 18 of the same chapter we see Satan. In verse 20 we have the spirits, that is the demons. The "serpents" means the satanic power, and "scorpions" means the demonic power. Satan, the serpents, and the scorpions have power, but we have authority. Our authority exceeds their power. There are many powerful cars on the streets. However, the little policeman has authority. When he says, "Stop," you stop. The cars have power; the policeman has authority. Satan and his demons have power, but we are God's policemen. We must give Satan the commandment, "Stop!" When Jesus gave this authority to His disciples and they exercised it to cast out demons, they were excited. However, the Lord Jesus told them, "Don't rejoice in this. You must rejoice in something better&#151;that your names are written in heaven." When Jesus came, the kingdom came. When Jesus cast out demons, He brought in the kingdom of God. Also, Jesus did this by and through His disciples. He gave them authority to cast out demons, and they did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>dd. Christ Received All Authority</H2><P>After His resurrection, Christ received all the authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). As the Lord God He had authority before His resurrection. As a man named Jesus of Nazareth, He was commissioned with all authority in heaven and on earth after His resurrection. Jesus is the real Adam. He has been committed with God's dominion.</P>
