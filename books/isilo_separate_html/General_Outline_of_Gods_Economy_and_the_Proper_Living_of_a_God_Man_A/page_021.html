We need Your presence and blessing even more in this final meeting. Lord, lead us in this meeting to have fellowship with one another and cause us to open ourselves to You and also to one another without any shadow, covering, or hiding, and even more, without any pretense or hypocrisy. O Lord, give us a pure heart and an open spirit. May You be set free, released, from within us. Enable us to have fellowship with one another, show concern for one another, and bear one another&#8217;s burden in You as the all-penetrating Spirit.<p>Lord, remember Your recovery on the earth. We truly thank You that now Your recovery has reached the six continents. Lord, there is the spreading in so many places, especially in Russia, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, even in Germany, and even more in the United Kingdom. For this we worship You. We also look to You for Your supply to meet our needs. We can never forget that we are not, but You are; we have nothing, but You have everything. O Lord, may You exercise Your might, especially in the last days, and grant us an unprecedented revival everywhere that You may be able to close this age and usher in Your kingdom age. All this requires us to cooperate with You by praying to You to touch Your throne and by presenting ourselves more to You. May You bring in more young people to receive the training that we may meet the great need in spreading to different places. Lord, remember us. Amen.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING IN THE NEW WAY IN TAIWAN SINCE 1984</h2><p>In this message I would like to fellowship with you concerning the Lord&#8217;s move in His recovery. In 1984 I went back to Taiwan. Although I did not know what the real reason was, I had a clear burden within me that I had to go back. In Taipei I was led by the Lord to bring up the matter concerning the new way. By 1984 the Lord&#8217;s recovery had been on the earth for sixty-two years; except for the first ten years, I directly participated in His recovery. Although I did not attend the meetings in those ten years, I had fellowship through correspondence. In 1933 when I left my job and went to Shanghai, I was immediately asked by Brother Nee to stay there as his long-term guest. That visit lasted nearly five months. At that time he did not have that much work to do, so he could afford me a great amount of time. I grasped that rare opportunity to frequently go to him for instruction. He spoke to me concerning the Lord&#8217;s recovery, item by item, from the beginning; he even told me the two-thousand-year history of the Lord&#8217;s church on the earth in its entirety. From then on, I have remained in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>By 1984 I had been in the Lord&#8217;s recovery for fifty-two years. At that time, however, I felt very heavy concerning the situation of the Lord&#8217;s recovery both in the United States and in the Far East, especially in Taipei. The general condition both in the United States and in the Far East had more or less entered into dormancy; it was as if everyone was asleep. That was something incomprehensible to me. At that time I did not know what to do. Therefore, I told the brothers and sisters in America that I needed to take off from my work and leave the United States possibly for one or two years. But this did not mean that I would not come back. I said that I would still come back several times every year. I would come back for the winter and summer trainings and other important conferences; I would come back three or four times every year. I considered that the foundation in the United States had been laid and that the work here was on the right track; hence, the brothers would know how to go on. I could not tell them what I was going to do in Taiwan, but I assured them that whatever was carried out there would be made known to the United States through my fellowship. After such a word of explanation, I went back to Taiwan.<p>In Taipei, on the one hand, I began to study the new way and hold trainings for it; on the other hand, I began to do the work of the Chinese translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. From 1984 to 1985, concerning the Chinese Recovery Version, I found out that I had to be involved personally because no one knew what was within me and no one knew the Bible so deeply or intrinsically. Therefore, I considered that if we would publish the Chinese Version, I had no choice but to labor painstakingly on it. Hence, I labored in Taipei for several years and did not return to the United States until 1989. In Taipei I worked day and night; at night I often worked until eleven o&#8217;clock and sometimes even twelve o&#8217;clock. In the translation of the text of the Recovery Version, I considered every sentence and decided on every word; I also finalized all the footnotes. The work of the Recovery Version in Chinese was completed in 1989. Then I felt that I had spent enough time in Taiwan and had to return to the United States.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
