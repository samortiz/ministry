   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Walking in Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:5 and 6 Paul says, Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To redeem the time is to seize every favorable opportunity to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to be wise in our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this evil age, every day is an evil day, full of pernicious things which destroy, spoil, and waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we must walk wisely that we may redeem the time, seizing every available opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To walk in wisdom is to grasp each opportunity to redeem our time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This redeeming of the time is related to the way we speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Often I must confess to the Lord my foolishness in talking to people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By talking to them in a certain way, I wasted time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I did not use wisdom enough to minister life and thereby to avoid friction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, I wasted time by engaging in conversation in which there was no ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pray that the Lord will grant us wisdom in our contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we walk in wisdom in speaking to others, we shall redeem our time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have missed opportunities to minister life because we spent the time in foolish talk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The best way to redeem our time is to pray perseveringly, to be watchful, and to walk in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do these things, we shall grasp all the favorable opportunities to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not persevere in prayer and if we are not watchful, we shall fail to grasp opportunities to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we contact others without the exercise of wisdom, we waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On some occasions we may waste a half hour in conversation where nothing of life is ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must learn to pray, to watch, and to seek the Lord for His wisdom so that we may redeem our time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 6 Paul says, Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 4:29 Paul refers to words that give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is Christ as our enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our speech should convey this grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word that builds up others always ministers such grace to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For our speech to be with grace means that Christ is expressed through our words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that our words should be the expression and utterance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every word must be the expression of Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our speech should also be seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salt makes things agreeable and pleasant to the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Speech seasoned with salt keeps us at peace with one another Mark 9:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our words are with grace and are salted, they will cause things to be agreeable, and they will also arouse the proper taste in others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 4:2-6 Paul covers five important matters: praying, watching, walking in wisdom, redeeming the time, and speech that is with grace and seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is difficult to determine whether the main point in these verses is prayer or redeeming the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But no matter which one we take as the focal point, it is a certainty that the proper Christian life requires that we redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All those on earth today are wasting time and missing valuable opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we need to redeem every moment and grasp every opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to live such a life, we need to be filled with Christ and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be one with Christ and allow His peace to arbitrate in us and His word to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall express Him by praying, by watching, and by walking in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are such persons, we shall be those who redeem the time and seize every available opportunity to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, our words will not be a cause of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the contrary, through the thorough dealing of the Lord, whatever proceeds out of our mouth will be a word of grace seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a word will make things agreeable and pleasant to the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all learn these things and practice them.</S>
