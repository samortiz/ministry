<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>27. By Receiving Christ and Walking in Him<br>as Living in the God-given Good Land</H2><P>To receive Christ and walk in Him as those living in the God-given good land (Col. 2:6) should also be considered as a way to experience and enjoy Christ. First we receive Christ as a portion of the good land, and then we walk in Him. We live, move, act, and have our being in Him as those living in the God-given good land. The children of Israel enjoyed the good land by tilling, sowing, watering, and harvesting the land. This is a type of the way to enjoy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>28. By Partaking of Christ<br>as the Body of the Shadows of All Our Necessities</H2><P>To partake of Christ as the body of the shadows of all our necessities (Col. 2:16-17) is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ. Our necessities include eating, drinking, a weekly rest, a monthly new beginning with light in the darkness, and yearly feasts. The Jews had a daily enjoyment in eating and drinking, a weekly enjoyment (the Sabbath) in being completed and resting, a monthly enjoyment (the new moon) with a new beginning with light in the darkness, and a yearly enjoyment with the annual feasts. Today Christ is our daily supply, our weekly rest, our monthly new beginning, and our yearly satisfaction. Christ is every kind of enjoyment to us. The enjoyments in the Jewish religion are merely shadows, but Christ is the body of all the shadows.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>29. By Taking Christ as Our Life and Living by Him<br>That We May Be Glorified at His Manifestation</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by taking Christ as our life and living by Him that we may be glorified at His manifestation (Col. 3:4). Today we have Christ within us, and in the future we will be manifested with Christ in His glorification. We receive Him as our life and live by Him. While we are living by Him as our life, this life is saturating our being. This saturation will continue until our body will be redeemed and glorified. That will be our manifestation with Christ in glory. Every day, especially every morning, we need to pray, "Lord, today is another day for me to take You as my life and to live by You." This is one of the ways for us to enjoy and experience Christ.</P>
