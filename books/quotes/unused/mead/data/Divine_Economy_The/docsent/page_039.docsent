   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In some Christian weddings the pastor charges the man to love his wife and charges the woman to submit herself to her new husband.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the husband and wife agree to do this, shortly after the wedding both of them may realize that they cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wife realizes that she cannot submit herself to her husband, and the husband realizes that he cannot love his wife to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To teach the husband to love his wife and the wife to submit herself to her husband is the ethical teaching of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, there is nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But according to God's economy, this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ethical teachings are according to man's culture, not according to God's economy, not according to God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of exhorting the husband to love the wife, and the wife to submit herself to her husband, it would be wonderful if the person marrying them would tell them: "Both of you need to realize that the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Don't make up your mind to submit yourself to your husband, and don't make up your mind to love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That would never work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, you need to open up yourselves to the Lord every day with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to turn your heart to the Lord so that there is nothing between you and the Lord, nothing between you and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every day, every minute, open up yourselves to the Lord who is the Spirit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Always say, 'Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I love You, Lord Jesus.'</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Open up yourselves to the all-inclusive Spirit in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do this, life will be supplied into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life will be given to your spirit, to your soul, and even to your mortal body to make you persons of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you as a husband practice this, spontaneously in every instance you will love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That will not be your love but the Lord Jesus within you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord loves your wife, so you will love her too because you are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a wife, if you practice this, spontaneously you will submit yourself to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever your husband says would not bother you because you are filled with the Lord Jesus within you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you will have a happy marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As you practice this day after day, the life-giving Spirit supplies you life, and this life transforms you organically and metabolically, making you the same as the Lord in His glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then both of you will grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You will even mature in life and will be so willing to be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then you will not only have a good marriage life, a good home life, but also a good church life."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not religion, ethics, or mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the all-inclusive Spirit giving life to all those who are open to Him, which is much higher than ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Spirit are all the divine attributes plus all the uplifted and glorified human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to forget about religion, ethics, and ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to stay away from the letter that kills and pay attention to the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to treasure God's economy and enjoy His divine dispensing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All day long we need to praise the Lord and call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pray-read His word, fellowship with Him, and be filled with Him and saturated with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will be transformed and grow in life to become the same image as He is.</S>
