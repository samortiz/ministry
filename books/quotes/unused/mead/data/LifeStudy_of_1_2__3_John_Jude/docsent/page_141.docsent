   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JUDE MESSAGE ONE CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH Scripture Reading: Jude 1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we begin the life-study of the book of Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The subject of Jude is contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 3 Jude entreats us to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall cover the first seven verses of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 1 and 2 are the introduction to the book of Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses Jude says, Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ: mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both Jude and James were brothers of the Lord Jesus in the flesh Matt 13:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James was one of the apostles Gal 1:19 and one of the elders in Jerusalem Acts 15:2, 13; 21:18 , reputed with Peter and John to be a pillar of the church Gal 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also wrote the Epistle of James James 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jude was not listed among the twelve, nor are we told that he was an elder in a church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, he wrote this Epistle, a short yet excellent book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to verse 1, this book is addressed to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word rendered by may also be translated for.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By denotes the strength and means of keeping; for denotes the purpose and object of keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the believers have been given to the Lord by the Father John 17:6 , and they are being kept for Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Bible teachers believe that this Epistle, like 1 and 2 Peter, was written to Jewish believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Jude s words, these believers were called, beloved in God the Father, and kept by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 2 Jude says, Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact that mercy is mentioned instead of grace in this greeting may be due to the church s degradation and apostasy see vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1 and 2 Timothy Paul includes God s mercy in his opening greeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s mercy reaches farther than His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the degraded situation of the churches, God s mercy is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As sinners, we were in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God s mercy reached us and brought us out of that situation and qualified us to receive His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In principle, grace requires that we be in a somewhat good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, because mercy reaches farther than grace, it is able to reach those who are in a most pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 3 says, Beloved, using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, entreating you to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Jude speaks of our common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is general salvation, which is common to and held by all believers, like the common faith Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some Christians misapply Jude s word about contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They think that to contend for the faith means to contend for matters such as baptism and foot washing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some argue concerning head covering or about the kind of bread used in the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the faith in verse 3 does not refer to such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The faith in this verse is not subjective; it is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not refer to our believing, but refers to our belief, to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13 , in which we believe for our common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this faith we should contend 1 Tim 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament God gave Abraham a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, through Moses God gave the law to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Gospel of John we are told that when the Lord Jesus came, grace came 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we have three important matters: promise, law, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some Bible teachers speak of the dispensation of promise, the dispensation of law, and the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to understand the truth in the New Testament, we need to see that God first gave a promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may say that this promise was on the main track of God s dealing with man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But because of the ignorance and unbelief of God s chosen people, it was necessary for God to give the law to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the book of Galatians Paul likens the law to Hagar, Abraham s concubine, not to Sarah, Abraham s wife Gal 4:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that Hagar was a type, or prefigure, of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the position of the law is not that of the wife, but that of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now in the New Testament God gives faith instead of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With the faith given by God there is both a subjective side and an objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The subjective side concerns our believing, and the objective side concerns the things we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 3 the faith does not denote our ability to believe; rather, it refers to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the faith refers to the contents of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter tells us in his second Epistle that like precious faith has been allotted to us 2 Pet 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This faith is subjective and refers to the faith that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This differs from the faith in Jude 3, for the faith here is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God s will given to us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The law includes the contents of the Ten Commandments and all the subordinate ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God s new will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This will even includes the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, it does not include such matters as head covering, foot washing, or methods of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But that is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To contend for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God s new will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One of these basic matters is Christ s death for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Suppose a modernist tells you that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption, but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is contrary to one of the main items of God s new will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to contend for the truth concerning Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many years ago in China we contended for the truth of redemption when we fought against the book For Sinners Only, a book which claims that a sinner can be favored by God or saved apart from the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible clearly says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We fought against that heretical book and inoculated the believers against its modernistic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We thank the Lord that in this country today many fundamental Bible teachers are also fighting against heretical, modernistic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This faith has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it.</S>
