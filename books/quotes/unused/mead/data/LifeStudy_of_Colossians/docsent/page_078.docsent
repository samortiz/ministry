   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO BIRTHS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the New Testament, Christ has had two births.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His first birth took place at His incarnation, and His second birth was in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church came into being through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His second birth the firstborn Son of God was born with all His brothers, who are the members of His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the church was born in resurrection, that is, in the second birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church now continues its existence in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ONE PERSON AND ONE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in God s economy there is one Person, Christ, and one way, the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The diagram is actually a chart of this one Person and the one way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Things such as Gnosticism and asceticism have no place here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teachings of Plato, Socrates, and Confucius and the practices of asceticism are all outside of Christ and apart from the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All religions, including Judaism and Christianity, are outside of the line depicted on the diagram.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the Lord s recovery we are being brought back to the one Person and the one way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to be recovered from so many different kinds of isms, philosophies, and practices to this one line, to Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today both Christ and the cross are in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, to be recovered to Christ and the cross is to be recovered to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our daily Christian experience we need to know the difference between practicing asceticism and taking the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To take the cross is certainly not to cause ourselves to suffer in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some saints may say that to experience the cross is to exercise faith in order to apply what Christ accomplished on Calvary to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But even this may be a subtle form of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In my early years as a Christian, I appreciated the book, The Imitation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually I learned that a great deal of what that book advocates is actually asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would apply the cross to our situation, we need to contact the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The effectiveness of the death of Christ is in this Spirit, just as the effectiveness of certain medicines is included in a certain prescribed dose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person takes the prescribed dose, he experiences the effectiveness of that medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the all-inclusive Spirit is an all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This dose includes the effectiveness of Christ s death and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Christ s resurrected and uplifted humanity is also in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the New Testament, the all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 7:39 we are told that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means the Spirit of God had not yet been compounded to become the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when Jesus was glorified, the process of compounding was accomplished, and the Spirit came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today it is the Spirit who descends upon us and enters into us to indwell our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this Spirit we have the effectiveness of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would apply the cross of Christ, we need to open ourselves to the Spirit, contact the Spirit, and allow the Spirit to have a free way within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Spirit will spontaneously apply the effectiveness of the death of Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what it means to apply the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, when we open to the Spirit and allow Him to apply the death of Christ to our situation, this experience of Christ s death will bring Christ to us in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, through the experience of Christ s death, we also experience His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we experience this, the more we can say with Paul, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Due to the influence of tradition, we often use the right terms in the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The terms are correct, but our understanding of them is mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One of these terms is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we speak of applying the cross to our situation, we need to have the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to realize that the effectiveness of the death of Christ is in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reality of the cross of Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, if we open to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to move freely within us, He will flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This inward flowing will bring to us the effectiveness of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, this application of Christ s death will bring Christ Himself in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then, as those who have died with Christ, we shall live with Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is here that Christ becomes our life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have died with Christ on the cross, and we have been raised up together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now, in resurrection, we have Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we spend more time considering the diagram, we shall be helped to realize in what way we have Christ as our life.</S>
