   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SOLVING AND TAKING AWAY OUR DIFFICULTIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother once testified that he had fasted and prayed related to a difficult situation and a burden within.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, even after two weeks, the situation had not changed and the burden was not relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He thought that it was only his problem and that he needed to spend more time to deal with it before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another week or two passed and still nothing changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then he went to a prayer meeting in which a brother called a hymn, Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This hymn had nothing to do with his situation, yet something marvelous happened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While everyone was singing, he suddenly became clear and enlightened; the difficulty ended and the burden was relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we were to ask this brother what happened, he would be perplexed, unable to explain; however, the difficulty in him was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another brother had a weakness, a sin, that he could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He tried to deal with it before the Lord repeatedly with fasting and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although he exerted much effort, nothing seemed to work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It even seemed that the more he tried to deal with it, the deeper the sin became; the more he tried to deal with it, the more he was bound and entangled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He later fellowshipped with some brothers, telling them that he had a weakness, a sin that entangled him and that he was unable to free himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He then asked the brothers for help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While he was fellowshipping, something marvelous happened; the sin left.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After those brothers listened to him and while they were still perplexed and did not know how to help him due to their lack of experience, this brother said, Brothers, I am no longer in need of help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us give thanks and praise to the Lord because this difficulty is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows the life in the Body carrying away this brother s difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although I am not a doctor and do not understand biology, physiology, or even bacteriology, I do have some understanding of blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The principle of Western medicine in treating an external ailment is mainly to remove by cutting and in treating an internal ailment is mainly to kill the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the Chinese medical doctors do not advocate cutting away or killing germs; rather, they help the blood in the human body to circulate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the circulation in the body is improved, all the ailments disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is logic to this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, sometimes gutters in the street are filled with mud, and water cannot flow freely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if a powerful and strong current swept through the gutters, all diseases would be removed, that is, the mud and other things would be flushed away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Doctors who practice Chinese medicine often speak of the blockage of the passage of vital energy and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They use different treatments to clean blood vessels and clear the path for vital energy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When everything is cleared up, there is a free flow in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consequently, there is a great circulation of blood that carries away and discharges everything that should not be in the body, with the result that all the ailments in the body are eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is true also in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we encounter difficulties, we often ask the Lord to perform surgery in us and to kill all the germs in us, but this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not until we have more fellowship with God s children that the flow in us is increased, our difficulties are removed, and the germs eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the fellowship of the Body, and this is the function of the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MEMBERS IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>NEEDING ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We often feel that we are unable to bear a particular burden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may feel oppressed and troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we try to fight and overcome, we still have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A very simple and convenient way is to go to our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not despise their youth, for there is something in them that can increase the flow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can tell them our difficulty and burden, and as we speak to them, the difficulty is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By the time we finish speaking, the heavy burden is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the flow of life in the Body carrying away difficulties and the fellowship of the Body solving our difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are experienced can all testify that once they stop seeing the brothers and sisters, they can no longer live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Similarly, if we are cut off from our Head, Christ, we will be unable to continue to live.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows two aspects of grace: one involves fellowship with the Head, and the other involves fellowship with the members.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot say which aspect is more important; both are equally important.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we touch the Head, we touch life; when we touch the members, we also touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fellowship among the members often causes the supply to flow into us, and it discharges whatever should not be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, a brother or sister who does not meet for a month will become weak and depressed inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should never think that those standing on the podium are the only ones who can supply others and that they do not need the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, if the brothers and sisters are not there listening while they speak, they will probably finish speaking in only ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, it is often not the speaker who is supplying the brothers and sisters but the brothers and sisters who are supplying the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there was no one listening, they would probably finish after ten sentences even if they wanted to speak over a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if the brothers and sisters are gathered there, they may be unable to finish after a hundred sentences, even if they started with only ten.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is because the brothers and sisters are there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not that the more they speak, the more they are supplying the brothers and sisters; rather, the more they speak, the more they are being supplied by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some brothers come and thank me for giving good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thank them, however, for giving me a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without them I would have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The brothers and sisters give me a good opportunity to release the Lord s word by supplying me with their spirit in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the happiest and most satisfying thing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the word is released, I feel satisfied and fed inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I go home, I can sleep very well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is grace, and this is also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a flow, and it is a great flow of life in the Body.</S>
