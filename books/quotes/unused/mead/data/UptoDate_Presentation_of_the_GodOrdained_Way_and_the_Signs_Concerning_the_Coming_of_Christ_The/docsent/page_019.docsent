   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Needing to Learn</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's desire is that every believer would prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, we should not only earnestly desire this gift but also make an effort to learn and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All Having the Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every saint has the capacity to prophesy for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has given this gift to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All believers possess this gift, and all can prophesy for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Having the Obligation</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 14:23-25 shows us if all prophesy in the church meetings, this will cause people to be convicted and to be brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if we do not prophesy, we owe God something, we owe others something, and we even owe ourselves something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church meetings, the thing that edifies people the most is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, what we prophesy edifies ourselves the most.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If in a meeting you stand up to prophesy for God, you feel that that meeting is good; otherwise, you may not feel that it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, whether a meeting is good or not does not depend on the meeting itself, but on whether or not you prophesy for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason is that once you speak, the meeting is yours, and all the riches become your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, if we want to be blessed and edified, we should pray and prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is our duty to God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That God wants us to speak for Him is based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Under the grace of the New Testament, God does not want to do things by Himself; He wants man to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God and man, man and God, coordinate mutually and cooperate together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we speak, God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This truly benefits man and glorifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I encourage all of you to prophesy for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be afraid or be shy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One who is shy cannot learn to speak a foreign language well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The same is true with our prophesying for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be afraid; regardless of this or that, speak and keep speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not be afraid that people will laugh at you if do not speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more you speak, the more you will be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, we can learn from one another and teach one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all are students and we all are teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consequently, we all are being perfected and are becoming good prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do mean business to learn to prophesy, I would propose to you that every week you set aside two hours and come together with eight or ten to teach one another and to learn from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, every one of you should have a morning revival every day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a publication that is very suitable for this, The Holy Word for Morning Revival, which contains Scripture text, portions from footnotes, and portions from Life-study Messages for our pray-reading and enjoyment of the Lord every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you have a morning revival every day in this way, you will surely have some inspiration which you may jot down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the weekend comes, you may put together the portions that you have written down, read them over, and do a little polishing so that it will be approximately three minutes long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This becomes a very good draft for your prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Doing this is something very basic, and it will be of great benefit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, in order to prophesy for God, we need to know more of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we need to memorize the best Scripture verses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you learn to memorize one or two verses a day, you will have an accumulation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, unconsciously, your prophesying will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, when you prophesy, avoid wordiness or common words; instead, speak God's word and speak concise words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eight or ten of you may take turns to practice, to adjust one another, and to learn from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within half a year or a year you will do very well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time, when you come together, you will be able to speak for God; you will be able to speak to the point and speak with substance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, you will be able to speak forth God so that people can understand, and you will be able to speak God into people so that they can receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If in a meeting twenty people can prophesy in this way, no individual preaching can compare with their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you practice this, in the beginning it may not be so good, but that does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should simply encourage everyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It does not matter if we have to "sacrifice" the meeting somewhat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After some practice, gradually the proper condition will be manifested and the improper condition will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After you have learned to prophesy and the ability has been developed, you will receive great profit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only will you be able to speak in the meetings, but even your speaking in your daily life will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We receive the inspiration in our daily life, and then we can present it in the meetings for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, our prophesying is not our instant inspiration; it is to prepare something from what we have received of the Lord in our daily life and to offer it in the meetings for others' benefit and for the church's building up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I put these words before you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as you mean business to practice this, I am confident that you all will be able to prophesy for God and become New Testament priests of the gospel who fulfill their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia on November 6, 1990</S>
