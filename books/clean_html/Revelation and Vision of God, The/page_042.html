<h2 class=head3>3. The Lord Jesus Being the Mingling of God with Man</h2><p>Therefore, Matthew 1 does not simply tell us how God was conceived within the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit and born as the Son, Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior and whose name is called Emmanuel (which is translated, God with us). Everyone understands this doctrine, but very few people have seen the vision portrayed by this doctrine. This vision is that the Triune God worked Himself into man and was mingled with man. This God is Triune (Gen. 1:26); He is the Father, the Angel of Jehovah (Christ—Exo. 3:2-15), and the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2). In the Old Testament, however, this Triune God had not yet entered into man. At the most He descended upon the judges and prophets as the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; Ezek. 11:5). It was at the beginning of the New Testament that we are clearly told that the Triune God entered into man and was mingled with man.<p>The Lord Jesus became flesh to be a genuine man. The basic element of His becoming a man was the mingling of the divine essence (the Holy Spirit) with the human essence. According to the record in the Gospel of Matthew, the Holy Spirit as the divine essence entered into Mary and was mingled with her human essence to give birth to a God-man. The One who was brought forth from her was not only a man but also God. Isaiah 9:6 says, “For a child is born to us… / His name will be called… / Mighty God.” The baby born in the manger was the Mighty God. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was not only a man but also God; He had both divinity and humanity. He was the mingling of divinity with humanity.<p>The Lord Jesus is the mingling of two natures—the divine nature and the human nature—without a third nature being produced; on the contrary, the two natures continue to exist distinctly. This is typified by the mingling of oil with fine flour (Lev. 2:4). When oil and fine flour are mingled together, the element of the oil and the element of the fine flour both continue to exist individually, without a third nature being produced as the result of a chemical reaction. This is not like the chemical process in which a neutral substance is produced when a base is added to an acid. Furthermore, mingling is different from union. Union is where two are merely joined together; mingling is where one enters into another, and the two are mingled together. The Holy Spirit entered into Mary’s womb and was mingled with humanity to give birth to One who was the expression of two in one, the expression of God and man, and whose name was called Jesus. Thus, the Lord Jesus was born a God-man as the mingling of God with man. In Him were both divinity and humanity. He was the complete God and the perfect man. This is a divine and mysterious matter in the Bible.<h2 class=head2>B. The Church Being the Aggregate of the Mingling of God with Man</h2><p>Today many Christians know that the church should exist, and their creeds also speak of the Triune God and the church, but they have not seen that the church is a product of the Triune God’s entering into man and being mingled with man. The Triune God and the church are two great visions that we should see. The church is an aggregate entity produced out of God’s working Himself into man in His Divine Trinity.<p>God entered into man and produced this model, which was first seen in Matthew 1 as an individual, the Lord Jesus. Later this individual model passed through death and entered into resurrection; when this model came out in resurrection, He was not just an individual. This is what the Lord Himself said: “Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (John 12:24). By this time, this model became a corporate product which is the church (Heb. 2:12; John 20:17, 19-23). In Matthew 1 an individual mingling of God and man was produced, but when this One was resurrected, all the ones chosen by God were included in Him and resurrected together with Him (Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3) to become the corporate mingling of God with man. Regardless of whether it is the individual model or the corporate product, the principle is the same: the Triune God enters into man and mingles with man.<p>Christianity today has not seen this matter. I do not only preach this truth, but I have also written books about it. Up until today, only slanderous people say that I am teaching heresy. Not one person with a degree and proper qualifications has written anything refuting this truth. In the Los Angeles area, there is a group of opposers who organized a research group to study the verses we quoted in order to refute our teachings. After studying Isaiah 9, they had to admit that Jesus truly is the Father.
