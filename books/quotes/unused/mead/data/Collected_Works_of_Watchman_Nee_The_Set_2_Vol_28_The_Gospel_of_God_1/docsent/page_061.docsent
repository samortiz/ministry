   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Acts 19:18 and 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are only three places in the New Testament which record this matter of confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come now to the third place, which is in Acts 19:18 and 19, which says, "And many of those who had believed came, confessing and making known their practices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is only the word "confessing," without the mentioning of "sins," the same thing is referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 John 1 it says "confess our sins," in Matthew 3 it says "confessed their sins," and here it says "confessing" and "making known their practices."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, the confession and the divulgence of their practices were not reckoned as a way to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, those who confessed and recounted their practices were not sinners but believers, people who were Christ's. This can be compared to some brothers and sisters standing up in the meetings to give a testimony acknowledging what they have done in times past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It can also be compared to some who testify at their baptism of things done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are altogether not saved through this kind of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some have believed and have become the Lord's. They now confess their past history.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They admit that they were evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are no longer afraid to tell the saints that they have been transferred from the miry clay onto a solid rock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Ephesians burned their magic books, they were making an open demonstration that though they had practiced these things, they now belonged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, "And many of those who had believed came."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not all came.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not every saved person needs to confess in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is because the Holy Spirit moves strongly to prompt people that they rise to disclose their practices that they may glorify God by showing the extent of God's salvation in them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Friends, you can discover from these three portions of the Word that the way of salvation is through faith and not through public confession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the three portions of the New Testament where confession of sins is specifically covered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is one other place, in James 5:16, where confession of wrongdoing to one another, rather than confession of sins, is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James tells us when a brother or sister is sick, the elders of the church should be called to pray over the sick person and anoint him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And if any wrongdoings are involved, there should be mutual confession and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a different matter from our subject today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have looked into all the verses in the New Testament concerning the confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you now see the way for one to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is through faith and not through the confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONCERNING THE PRACTICE OF CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me say a few words concerning the practice of confessing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all know whom we have offended and defrauded before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we were saved, we felt sorrowful in our heart and wished to confess to those same people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is something that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God commands, even compels us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is something taught in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Having seen God's righteousness and the glory in His presence, we now realize that it is unrighteous to be indebted to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What then shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We refuse to be unrighteous persons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We even tell ourselves, "I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will be a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will thoroughly deal with all the areas in which I have been unrighteous or not right with others so that they may forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no problem with your sins being forgiven before God, but you must make confession to men of your offenses to men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, confession and restitution are absolutely not the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You do not need to make confessions and recompense before you can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a saved person, and one who is just, you are merely asking pardon from people you have wronged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The thief on the cross must have robbed many and sinned against many.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, he had no opportunity to confess and make recompense to anyone, because he could hardly move on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was not able to return any item which he had plundered from others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet, without any confession or restitution, he still could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus said to him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may consider this robber as the first person to be saved in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was the first to be saved after the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the problem is not one of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The thief on the cross, though deprived of the opportunity of making recompense, was nevertheless saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he had lived on, he should have made recompense for righteousness' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the question of his salvation was resolved on the cross in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Confession is something that follows salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was already saved on the cross; his salvation was altogether not due to any kind of confession or restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he confessed his sins again at some later date, it would not have saved him more.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here we are clearly shown that salvation is by faith, whereas confession is a spontaneous expression of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since we now know our righteous God, we desire to clear up the problem of our sins before man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our salvation is totally a matter between us and the Lord Jesus; it is resolved through Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are three things here which we must be clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, we confess our sins before God, judging ourselves, repenting, and acknowledging that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these are done before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This causes us to have faith to receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Second, after we are saved, we become aware of our offenses towards others and wish to clear them up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We wish to make recompense and to confess to those whom we have defrauded so that we may live a righteous life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Third, after we are saved, as the Holy Spirit works in us, we want to tell others what kind of sinners we were and how many sins we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may do this during our baptism, and we may do this after baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not know if you are clear or not.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Never deem the confessing of sins so highly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must put it in the place accorded by the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since the Bible never considers it as a way to salvation, neither should we.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thank God it is the Lord Jesus who saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I did not save myself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thank God it is the cross of Christ that saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am not saved by my own cross; the cross of Christ did the saving work.</S>
