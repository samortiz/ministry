   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 To Open Their Eyes,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Turn Them from Darkness to Light,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and from the Authority of Satan to God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we connect Acts 26:18a with Luke 15:8, we see that the enlightening of the Holy Spirit is to open people s eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit opens the believers eyes and turns them from darkness to light that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To turn from darkness to light is to have a transfer from darkness into light, and to turn from the authority of Satan to God is to be transferred out of the authority of Satan into God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Darkness is a sign of sin and death; light is a sign of righteousness and life John 1:4; 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The authority of Satan is Satan s kingdom Matt 12:26 , which belongs to darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan is the ruler of this world John 12:31 and the ruler of the power of the air Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has his authority and his angels Matt 25:41 , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Acts 26:18a, we are transferred from the authority of Satan to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, to be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God s kingdom belonging to light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Formerly we were in darkness under the authority of Satan, but we have been transferred out of darkness and the authority of Satan into light and God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Darkness is actually the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we are in darkness, we are under satanic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Light is God Himself 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when we are in the light, we are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as Satan and darkness are one, so God and light are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The greatest transfer we can have is the transfer from darkness to light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are separated unto God by the Spirit, we experience such a transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 To Enlighten Them That They May Repent</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit enlightens the believers that they may repent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 6:4a speaks of both repentance and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only through the Spirit s work of enlightening us are we able to repent and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Convicted by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>concerning Sin Related to Adam ,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>concerning Righteousness Related to Christ ,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and concerning Judgment Related to Satan</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The believers are those who have been convicted by the Spirit concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 16:8-11 says, Having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit always convicts people concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sin entered through Adam Rom 5:12 , righteousness is the resurrected Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were born of sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we believe in Him, He is righteousness to us, and we have been justified in Him Rom 3:24; 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The convicting work of the Spirit is related to Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We became fallen in Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ s death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whereas those who believe in Christ receive Him as their righteousness, those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day the Spirit came to us to separate us unto God by convicting us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through the convicting work of the Spirit we have been sanctified unto God.</S>
