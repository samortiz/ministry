   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN BECOMING SKILLFUL IN USING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF INTERPRETING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To accomplish anything, we need the proper weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We likewise need the skill and also a strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a war, the first thing you need is the weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then you must also learn the skill of how to use the weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lastly, you need the best strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have these three things you surely will win the war.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the book of Acts you could see these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must consider what the weapons are in the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most of us consider that in this book the Spirit is the main emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the word, either logos or rhema , is mentioned seventy-eight times in this book, whereas the Spirit, referring to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is used less than sixty times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, the Acts does not say that the Spirit grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead it says that, the word of God grew and multiplied 6:7; 12:24; 19:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would be good to get into all these verses concerning the word in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, the entire human race is altogether carried on by the spoken and written word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you took the written word away, what kind of society would there be?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Newspapers are everywhere, as are every kind of book, magazine, or other printed media, full of the written word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God also does everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does everything by His word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Acts, the apostles preached the word and spoke the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN WORK</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN RELATION TO THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be helpful to briefly examine the history of Christian work in relation to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the United States and Canada among the Protestants, the Baptists have the highest membership with over twenty-five million.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Methodists rank second, with close to thirteen million.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In their early days, the Methodists used the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, in this they followed John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John Wesley s most prevailing contemporary was George Whitefield, who was more powerful than John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did two things he prayed and he studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He read the Greek text of the New Testament thoroughly on his knees, word by word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, he did it by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although he did not have the term pray-reading, he practiced this very much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One account in his writing tells us that on a certain day, after he had been praying on a mountain for quite a long time, he came down and found a large crowd waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he began to speak to them, the entire contents of his speaking was nothing but the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way his speaking was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a fact of history.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>George Whitefield never spoke in tongues, yet he was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can deny history.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, no one can deny the history of the saints who practiced the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The history of these saints began with the mystics in the 1600 s, right after the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was a reaction to the Reformation which had become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord raised up this reaction within the Catholic Church under the seeking saints such as Father Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, and eventually Madam Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you read church history, you would realize that they were powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were very much influenced and helped by them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, we translated their books almost fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In them there is no word at all, not even a hint, that they cared for the so-called baptism in the Holy Ghost, yet they were very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following this William Law was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>History tells us that there were two William Laws, although actually he was one person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first William Law was a person of dead letters who studied theology.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, at a certain point he received something, which was the real experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, although not in the way practiced by today s Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From that time he became another person, the William Law of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He realized that what the mystics experienced was very much needed and a great help to all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, he put the mystics writings into a more practical form.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That became a great help to the Christians in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After this, Andrew Murray put what William Law wrote into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No one can deny that while Andrew Murray was working in South Africa, at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, he was very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One of his most prevailing books is The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would encourage you to read that book, especially chapter five entitled The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His other most prevailing book is his Holy of Holies, an exposition on Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Following Andrew Murray, the Lord raised up Jesse Penn-Lewis, who received her help from Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis were altogether on the subjective death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, her writings ushered her readers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through her writings you may touch the Spirit in a very practical and prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that you could get a copy of her paper, The Overcomer, in particular the issues published in 1913 and 1914.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Her writings were prevailing, and her speaking was likewise prevailing and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet, she was strongly and absolutely against the practice of Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Her book, War on the Saints, attacked the practices of Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Brother Nee s three volume book, The Spiritual Man, the chapter on spiritual warfare draws freely from Mrs. Penn-Lewis s work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother Nee said clearly that the three volumes were not purely his writing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When he put out those three volumes he included a long preface, giving a record of the books and pages from which he collected others writings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The greater part of the works from which he drew was from Mrs. Penn-Lewis, especially the portion on spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis associated herself with the leader of the Welsh revival, Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The revival of Wales 1904-1906 was prevailing to such an extent, that if you had desired to preach the gospel, you could almost have found no one who had not yet been saved there.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Evan Roberts, a coal miner and an unlearned man, and his sister were used by the Lord to bring in that revival, the most prevailing revival in this century.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In that revival there was no tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Roberts saw much demonic activity at that time, and he learned something concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He passed on all his experiences to Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Mr. and Mrs. Penn-Lewis both became very close friends of Evan Roberts, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis put all his experiences during the Welsh revival into writing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Not only did Evan Roberts become quite prevailing, but also Mrs. Penn-Lewis s writings became very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, they both were entirely against Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis considered the practices of Pentecostalism to be related to the latent power of the soul, related to the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brother Nee translated her material concerning the latent power of the soul into Chinese and added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He realized that what those Pentecostalists experienced in the principle of the latent power of the soul corresponded with the practice of some of the ancient Chinese, who by this power were able to contact the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One of the elders in Taiwan, before he was saved, was one of the top experts in practicing the latent power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>While remaining in one city, he was able by the power of the soul to visit another city.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He also had supernatural visions.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He related to us in detail many of his experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>T. Austin-Sparks was a young co-worker of Jesse Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As a young man, he was a modernistic pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He heard Mrs. Penn-Lewis s preaching and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After his conversion, he became a learner under Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even up until now, in the past two centuries, no writings on the inner life have ever reached such a high level as those of Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Although I am honest to say this, I was entirely not in agreement with him concerning the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We had over thirty long talks together.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He came to visit us in Taiwan twice and I returned the visit by staying with him four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He brought me to his retreat in Scotland, where we stayed together for one week, having private talks every day concerning one thing the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Although we could not agree, I do admit that his writing on the inner life was excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, my point is that this brother was altogether against Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In 1955 we invited Brother Sparks to come to us in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Many of the saints became excited, for they expected to receive great help for the inner life from him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Some of these excited ones held their own meetings, apart from the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>On one afternoon in the third hall, a brother who was a professor received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He became crazy with this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Although he did not speak in tongues, he began to speak by walking around the hall, speaking continually for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All the attendants became excited.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This exercised quite an influence upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>A small number among us who spoke in tongues also became excited over this.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>That was their opportunity to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>However, when Austin-Sparks arrived and came to know of this, he charged those saints to stop that activity.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>That shocked the excited ones, who then ceased their activity.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Later they all admired the messages he gave.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I am trying to be fair and I am trying to help you to be fair.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The church has a long history of twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It was only in the last part of its history, since the middle of the last century, that Pentecostalism was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the period of eighteen and a half centuries before that time, the church already had a long history.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Even in these last one and a half centuries many wonderful things have happened in the church besides Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I cannot go along with Pentecostalism because those who practice this make the Pentecostal things everything.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>How could the Pentecostals annul everything else and make Pentecostalism to be the thing?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They claim that tongue-speaking is the unique sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Who can go along with this?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Many throughout history have experienced the Lord and become prevailing apart from the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I myself was saved in February of 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I was fully converted and changed.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I gave up the world and have never gone back for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Likewise, the mystics, such as William Law, Andrew Murray, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks experienced the Lord and became the top among the inner life people.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Many of the Brethren teachers such as John Nelson Darby, C. H. Mackintosh, and William Kelley, produced writings not only full of knowledge, but full of power and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Just one hundred thirty years ago, around 1850, the Brethren movement became so prevailing throughout Europe and reached even to Central America.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>D. M. Panton said that the Brethren movement was much stronger than the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The only difference was that the Reformation widely propagated itself, while the Brethren movement sought to conceal itself.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>They became so powerful by speaking and teaching the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>They swept through all of England.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We cannot deny the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>At this time also there were great Bible expositors such as G. Campbell Morgan, A. J. Gordon, and S. D. Gordon.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>When G. Campbell Morgan held a Bible study meeting in London, the hall was crowded night after night.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>That was really powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In those meetings there was no speaking in tongues, even though speaking in tongues had already begun in England.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Charles Spurgeon, the great evangelist in England, Charles Finney, D. L. Moody, and Jonathan Edwards in America are among the other giants in church history who never practiced the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If you studied history, you would find out that they were powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>They all were powerful in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>D. L. Moody said that if his entire library were to be burned and his Bible and C. H. Mackintosh s Notes on the Pentateuch were to remain, that would be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>D. L. Moody s messages were mostly based on the Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Dr. C. I. Scofield brought the Brethren teachings into American theology.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>He put out his Scofield Reference Bible based upon the Brethren teachings that nearly dominated American fundamental Christianity for some years.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The Moody Bible Institute still carries Dr. Scofield s Bible correspondence course.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>There has been a strong history in the church concerning the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Whoever is skillful in using the Word of God is powerful, and their work remains because it is built up with the solid Word.</S>
