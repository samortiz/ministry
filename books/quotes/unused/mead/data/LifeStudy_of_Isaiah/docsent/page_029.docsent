   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses indicate that no matter what the situation might be on earth and regardless of the corruption and degradation among God's people, Christ is still on the throne in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Isaiah looked at the situation among the children of Israel, he became very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, in the first five chapters of his prophecy, he had very little to say that was good about the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was at this point that the Lord brought him into a vision so that he could see the Lord of glory sitting on the throne v. 1 . The Lord seemed to say to Isaiah, "Don't look down at the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you look down, you will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Look up at Me. I am still here.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after a period of time, what was so sweet to you might have become bitter like vinegar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then instead of a honeymoon you have a "vinegarmoon."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In your disappointment with the church life, you may think that it would be better if you moved to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I can assure you that you cannot find a church that experiences a continual honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In every church there is some vinegar.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in the church life, we need to learn not to look down at the situation but to look up to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not look at anything or anyone other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ whom we look up to is no longer on the cross; today Christ is on the throne.</S>
