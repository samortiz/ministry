   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian life is a life in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To know the Spirit, we have to know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Resurrection is the Triune God consummated to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not able to understand such a deep and high mystery, the mystery of resurrection, but we can experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not even understand our human life, but we can experience this life daily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we eat food, we take in many nourishing elements and vitamins which we do not understand, yet we can enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not know what human life is, but we can surely enjoy this life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who can fully understand the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot understand the Triune God, but He is available for us to experience and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nearly every morning, my first prayer is somewhat like this: "Thank You, Lord, for the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank You for the safety.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank You for Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank You for Your cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank You for Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank You for Your preserving of my health."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a simple prayer, but through this simple prayer, I enjoy the Triune God and I am filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been enjoying the Triune God for close to seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot deny there is a God, because day by day I enjoy Him as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The God whom we contact is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we contact God, resurrection functions in us, and everything is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When resurrection functions in us, we are full of joy, full of peace, full of rest, full of praising, and full of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are experiencing the Spirit as resurrection, all the negative things are on the cross, in the tomb, and under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Human life is full of troubles, worries, and all kinds of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can rid our being of these things only by our God who is resurrection, which is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit kills, and the Spirit also resurrects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because Christ's killing death and His uplifting resurrection are compounded in the compound Spirit, whom we are enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we enjoy the compound Spirit, we are experiencing the inner killing and the inner resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we have this killing plus the resurrecting, we have God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Killing plus resurrecting is God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God moves in us, works in us, functions in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He gives us Himself as patience, peace, and power to endure sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He gives us Himself as everything we need to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is mysterious, resurrection is mysterious, and the compound Spirit is also mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible has much to say about these three items, but they are mysterious to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though they are so mysterious, they are real in our daily experience in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to experience the Spirit's application of Christ's resurrection and its power all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The full-time trainees need to enter into this experience in their limited environment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Five sisters may live in one apartment unit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this apartment, each of them has to do everything carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, they can offend one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This apartment is like a small "tomb" to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be in the full-time training is a suffering, but in this suffering, there is joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we try to escape from the environment which God has arranged for us, we will not have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we stay in this limited environment, we can experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to experience resurrection, we also need to be limited in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we gossip, the more resurrection is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we gossip, the more there is no Spirit in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To experience the Spirit as the reality of resurrection, we need to turn to our spirit to pray, praise, sing, or talk to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The title of Psalm 18 indicates that this psalm was David's conversation with God, his talk to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to talk to God and consult with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After ten minutes of talking to God, we will be on fire and full of the Spirit as the reality of resurrection.</S>
