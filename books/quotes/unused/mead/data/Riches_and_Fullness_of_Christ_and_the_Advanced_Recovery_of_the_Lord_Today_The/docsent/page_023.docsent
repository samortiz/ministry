   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 24, 31, 26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible compares Christians to sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sheep are in flocks, and that is why in the Bible a flock refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christians love to flock together, in the same way that sheep like to flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one sheep strays off from the flock, it will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When it returns to the flock, it will be at rest and be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the same with a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After he is called out from the world, he will no longer want to flock together with the worldly people; he has a nature different from them already.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christians come together, they feel at home, happy, and at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS ORDAINED BY THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians love to meet; hence, to them, meeting is an important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church has been on this earth for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mainly it can be divided into two groups, the Roman Catholics and the Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Outwardly speaking, their ways of meeting are very different, but in principle they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both worship according to the human natural feeling and need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These traditional and natural ways are different from the scripturally ordained way for Christians to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says that God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christian meeting is not a service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a matter of exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without the exercise of the spirit, there is no true worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If anyone observes the Catholic or Protestant way of worship, however, he will realize that such worshippers do not seem to have a spirit and do not exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they worship according to the human natural feelings and needs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the cathedrals are designed and built to fit in with man's sense of fear of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person enters these places, he will become fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the believers enter the cathedrals only for the purpose of attending the services, the pastors, in meeting everyone's need for worship, design a printed program, a form, and some regulations for the conducting of the services.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Worshipping God in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the Bible has none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord began His ministry at the age of thirty, He indicated to others that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time there was a temple at Jerusalem, and the Jews thought that God was in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, they all went to the temple to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus also went to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time, was God in the temple or in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When men wanted to worship God, should they go to the temple or to the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man were to go into the temple, he would have seen the priests helping the Jews to slaughter bulls and lambs and offer them up as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were worshipping God according to tradition, and apparently they were very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, however, there was a group of people with the Lord Jesus, including tax collectors and prostitutes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They surrounded the Lord Jesus, and they spoke and laughed together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Someone leaned on His breast, and another washed His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some asked questions; others answered questions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There was no form and no regulation, but there was freedom and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In simple terms, there were two kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first kind was very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The priests served according to their order and performed the ceremonies step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second kind appeared confusing outwardly, but everyone was active, free, and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both kinds of meetings are recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Which one do you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We see from the Bible that God is Spirit, and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Christian meeting itself is a worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we come together, we come to worship God and to enjoy Him and for God to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, we receive His love and enjoy His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are also enlightened and taught by Him, and we receive His word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason and the goal for us Christians to flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the emphasis is not on the form, but on the organ that we use; are we using our spirit, or are we using our mind?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do we use the natural mind that has been affected by tradition, or do we put the mind aside, deny our own judgment, and worship only in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What God wants is for us to worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the first consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Receiving God's Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second, the Christian meeting is not only for us to enjoy God and for God to enjoy us, but it is a time for us to be taught of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible shows us that the greatest thing between God and us is that God speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If God does not speak to us, that means that God has rejected us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If God is present with us, He will prove His presence by His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is a speaking God, but sometimes He is silent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His silence is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even His silence is a kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The principle is that whenever we come to God, He always speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His grace, love, and peace, all come to us through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For this reason, whenever we come together, we should exercise our spirit to contact God and to wait for Him to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Old Testament, God rarely spoke directly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For the most part, He spoke through different men.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hebrews 1 says that God spoke of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets v. 1 . In the New Testament, He spoke to us in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Acts and the Epistles, He spoke through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul said that he spoke as if he did not have the Lord's word and was speaking only according to his opinion, but in the end he also said that he thought he also had the Spirit of God 1 Cor 7:25, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, his words were recorded in the Bible and became the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is God speaking to us through men.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every time we Christians meet, we worship God and offer up our aspirations and adorations.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At the same time, we receive grace and supply from God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything that comes from God comes through the word, but God does not give His words to us directly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, He speaks to us through men.</S>
