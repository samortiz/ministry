<p>Romans 8:24: "We were saved in hope." This is for the future.</p><p>We praise and thank the Lord that we are saved! But there are still two salvations that are not yet accomplished. This is why we have to pursue them. If a person is not yet saved, we tell him that the minute he believes he will be saved. This salvation refers to the salvation from the punishment of hell. Even though we are already saved, we still need to be saved from the power of sin, and we still need to seek after the glory of the coming kingdom. This is why we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</p><p>Mr. D.L. Moody was a powerful preacher and a capable soul-winner. But he said that he had never in his life seen a lazy man be saved! This means that even though a man may want to be saved from the punishment of hell, if he is lazy, he cannot make it. "Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Eph. 5:14).</p><p>During the past few weeks, I have been speaking on the fact that we cannot do anything, and that the minute we try, we suffer greatly. But if we surrender and believe, Christ will do everything for us. This, however, is only half of the story; there is still the other half, which is the working out of our own salvation with fear and trembling. We have to be responsible for this part. If we do not do this part, we will become unbalanced. It is true that Christ has died for us, shed His blood, and resurrected and ascended for us. Some think that since this is the case, all they have to do is worship and be absolutely passive. There is no more need to pray, to read the Bible, or to consecrate themselves. However, the very fact that God has accomplished salvation means that we should be all the more zealous. God has done it, and we should work it out. But how can we work it out? The next verse tells us.</p><p>Philippians 2:13: "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verses 12 and 13 can be considered two sides of one glorious truth; they include everything. If we look at the first verse, we may think that we have to do everything ourselves. But if we look at the second verse, we see that everything is done by God. On the one hand, these verses say that we should work it out. On the other hand, they say that God will do it. These are not contradictory words; they are complementary words. Verse 12 says that we should work it out, while verse 13 says that God will enable us to work it out.</p><p>These two verses explain a very important two-sided truth in the Bible. From the Bible we see, on the one hand, that God has many solemn commandments; He commands that we do this and do that. It seems as if He has put an unbearable burden upon us. We are pressed beyond measure, unable to move our feet, and are pressured to the point of death. On the other hand, there seem to be many promises of God which promise that God is doing this and that for us; everything seems to be according to His grace and everything seems to be His work; it seems as if we have nothing to do. Because some do not understand this two-sided truth, they become biased. Some people think that everything is related to God's commandments, and that we have to obey them ourselves. They see God's commandments as a heavy burden. On the one hand, they cannot lift it, yet on the other hand, they cannot drop it. They feel that they are pressured to the point of death. Then there are some who think that everything is according to God's grace and God's work. God accomplishes everything, and man does not have to be responsible for anything. Inevitably, this leads to laxity. These biases (no matter which side one is biased toward) are dangerous in that one can neither fulfill the scriptural commands nor obtain the scriptural promises. God's truth is equally important on both sides. God is working in us, and at the same time, we are working it out; we work out what God has worked into us. If we merely allow God to work within us without working out this work ourselves, we will have nothing. However, if we try to work things out ourselves without allowing God to work within us, this also will result in nothing.</p><p>Everything with the human life can be summed up in the words "the willing and the working." To will is an inward resolution, while to work is an outward act. We act out whatever we have inwardly resolved to do. This is the meaning of willing and working. The willing refers to the condition of our heart, while the working refers to our outward conduct. Yet both our inward willing and our outward working are the result of God's operating within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure. All the willing is done through God's operation, and all the working is done also through His operation.</p><p>We often want to obey God yet find ourselves unable to obey. But God tells us that He will work in us to the extent that we will obey and work out what needs to be worked out. Many Christians find it very painful that they cannot do many things. They often want to tell God how painful it is to try to obey Him, and that they cannot make it. They do not want to love the world, yet they cannot stop loving it. They do not want to hate others, yet they cannot stop hating. God has not ordained that we should suffer. His intention is to operate in us until we become able to do whatever we should do. Hence, we should say to the Lord, "Although I cannot obey, give up the world, or love others, I ask that You operate within me until I become willing to obey You, drop the world, and stop hating others." If you believe, you will see a change after you pray this way. Even a matter that you have not been able to overcome for a period of three to four years will be overcome through such committing and believing.</p>
