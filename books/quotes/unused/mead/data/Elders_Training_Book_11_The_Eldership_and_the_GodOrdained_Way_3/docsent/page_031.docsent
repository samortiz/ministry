   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should not exercise ourselves to have a clear sight.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The clear sight comes from our contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Daniel was a person who received vision after vision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That means he had the clear sight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was not because he exercised himself in his wisdom, in his knowledge, or in his learning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He received the clear sight because he was a person contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first six chapters of the book of Daniel show us that the overcomers among the captives, including Daniel, were persons who were always contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in the last six chapters, chapters seven to twelve, the visions came to Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we must be persons who are filled with the Lord, saturated with Him and full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As such persons, we will not be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will be clear in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we will neither judge according to what we see nor decide according to what we hear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will do our responsibility according to what Christ is, ministering Christ with His salvation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Daniel 1 shows us how Daniel and his companions overcame the king, Nebuchadnezzar, in not eating the idolatrous diet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daniel 3 says that Nebuchadnezzar made a golden image and forced the people to worship it, but Daniel's companions refused to do this and were rescued by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Daniel served the Lord in the midst of such a negative situation under a number of Gentile kings, he was not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Which one of us would remain in captivity to serve the kings of Babylon and Medo-Persia?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Surely they were altogether not promising, yet Daniel remained with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He just ministered God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our service as co-workers and elders, we serve with much selection according to our evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is best not to have any selection, any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should love everyone with the same level of love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should care for all the saints, even though some may not like us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nearly all the elders, full-timers, and co-workers serve people according to their choice, their preference, and their evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a certain one invites us to their home, we will go because they are our favorite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If another one invites us we will refuse, excusing ourselves because we are too busy or too tired.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we are exercising our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our evaluation of others frustrates us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our natural sight kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We always need to take care of our duty to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a church meeting, someone may stand up and say things that bring death into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The entire congregation may be disgusted and disappointed with this speaking, but we should not be offended by it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of this we have to do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this person speaks, we should rise up to give an edifying, encouraging, life-giving word, without rebuking this person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should give a strong word, ministering Christ to the entire congregation for perhaps ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then everyone will be satisfied by our word, and they will have something on which to feed.</S>
