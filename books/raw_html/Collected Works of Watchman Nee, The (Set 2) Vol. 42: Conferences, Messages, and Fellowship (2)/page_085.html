<h2 class="head1">LETTING GO AND COMMITTING</h2><p>Overcoming means to stop acting, to stop managing, to ignore, and to cease our own activities. It is forgetting about ourselves and committing everything to God. We have to say to the Lord, "I commit everything to You. From now on, I do not care if I am good or bad." Once we commit ourselves to the Lord in this way, He will take over. Once we let go, God will take over. Suppose I give you a cup. When I let go and you pick it up, the transfer is completed. But if I serve you a cup of tea, but do not let go of the cup, you cannot pick it up. The same is true with God. He wants us to let go before He will pick up. However, we expect God to pick up before we let go. But God is waiting for us to let go before He will pick up. God never does anything to supplement man's work; He will never help anyone. He wants to gain all the glory. This is why He has to do all the work. If we try to do anything by ourselves, God will not do anything. We have to let go completely before God will begin His work.</p><p>When a temptation comes, we can say to the Lord, "Here is a temptation. I cannot withstand it, and I will not try to withstand it. Lord, You must withstand it for me." If we let go in this way and allow the Lord to do it for us, He will become our victory. Every day that we live, we live by grace. I have seen many people, perhaps one or two thousand, who have been delivered from sin and are walking on the path of holiness.</p><p>A brother in Tientsin by the name of Lee once asked, "How do I let go?" I said, "Brother, what is your job?" He said, "I am the manager of the purchasing department of a fabric store." I said, "Suppose your boss Mr. Lin told you that the board of directors of the company had decided to let you go, and that you should start handing over your responsibility to others. What would you do?" He said, "I would have no choice but to start my resignation process." I said, "If a salesman came in to sell fabric to you, would you go to your abacus? Would you still have to find out how much you have in inventory, and how much you need to buy?" He said, "No. I would tell him that I am not working here anymore, that I have resigned, and that he should talk to the new manager." This is the meaning of letting go. We have been discharged by God; there is no need for us to do anything anymore. We only need to let go and let God do everything. When Satan comes, he does not tempt us first to sin. He just wants us to act on our own. As long as we move, he will have a way. Our victory lies in our refusal to move or expose our head. We do not have to try to fight back at all. The more we oppose, the quicker we will fail. All we need to do is to commit ourselves to the Lord's hand and forget about doing or managing anything. This is victory, and this is letting go.</p><p>One brother said that he wrestled with sin daily. Another young brother told him that he should never wrestle with sin. The first brother asked, "If I fail when I fight and withstand, will I not fail even more if I do not fight or withstand?" The young brother said, "No! I would just say to God, `I cannot make it. You have to make it for me. I commit myself to You.'" This is the secret to victory. Once you let go, the Lord will pick you up. Victory does not depend on how much you have done, but on how much God has done.</p><p>Once a brother was going down a dry well. He tied a rope to the edge of the well and lowered himself down by the rope. As he was lowering himself down, he suddenly found that he had come to the end of the rope. He did not know how much lower he had to go before he would come to the bottom of the well so he decided to climb back to the surface. But as he tried to climb up, he realized that he had exhausted all his strength. Since he could not go up or down, he cried for help. But it was a deserted place and the well was deep. He shouted until he was exhausted, but still no one came to his rescue. Eventually, he could not hold on any longer. Since he was a Christian, he thought that he should pray. So he prayed, "God, please help me to fall into eternity." Then he let go of the rope and fell from the air to the earth. However, he only fell two or three inches! He regretted that he had held onto the rope for so long and that he had not let go of the rope sooner. Brothers and sisters, overcoming means letting go! Let go! Do not be afraid; you will not fall into eternity. Rather, you will fall onto the eternal Rock. If you let go and do not take control, you will overcome. Victory is something that Christ accomplishes; it is not something that you accomplish. All you have to do is let go and give up. Christ will take over and everything will be accomplished. The overcoming life is for those who have completely let go.</p><p>When I was in Chefoo, a brother who was a doctor by the name of Shi came to listen to my preaching. He had a long history of smoking cigarettes. He had been saved for four years, and he had married a Christian sister. His wife had been to a seminary and was a very upright person. Brother Shi had tried to quit smoking for four years. Every year he would make seven or eight attempts, but the longest he was able to stop smoking was only four days. When a cigarette was not in his hand, it was in his mind. He could do nothing about this, and he would eventually smoke again. He often smoked secretly at the hospital. When others came, he would snuff out the cigarette and put some breath freshener in his mouth to hide his smoking from others. He told me that his smoking had caused him much suffering. He had tried all kinds of ways to quit but had not been successful. He came and asked me what he should do.</p><p>When I heard his story, I was happy within, because I knew that another person was about to go through the gate of victory. I said, "Brother Shi, you are a doctor. If a healthy person comes to the hospital and asks to be admitted, would you admit him?" He said, "No. If he is not sick, the hospital cannot admit him. The hospital only admits those who are sick." When I heard this, I was even happier, because here was another visitor for the Lord's clinic, and this was one more opportunity for the Lord to demonstrate Himself. I said to him, "Do you realize that the Lord Jesus only takes terminal cases? You say that you cannot quit smoking. Is this not a terminal case?" He said, "Indeed it is. I have tried to quit for three or four years but have not been successful. This is a terminal illness as far as I am concerned." I then said, "Okay, now is the time for you to see what the Lord Jesus can do. What should you do? You only need to say to the Lord, `I cannot quit smoking. I cannot make it. I will not try to quit anymore. Lord Jesus, I commit myself to You. Lord, You can do it; please save me.'"</p><p>Then I showed him Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 12:9, which says, "And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me." I said, "It is wonderful that you cannot quit smoking. Paul boasted in his weaknesses. What are you going to do with your weakness? Are you going to cry about it? No. You have to say to the Lord, `I am weak. I have completely failed in my efforts to quit smoking. I cannot quit. I will always smoke, but Lord, You are in me. I will not try to quit anymore. You must quit for me.'" He prayed in this way, and after he prayed, he went home. The second day he came to me and told me what he said to his wife. He had said, "For four years you have been bugging me and arguing with me. Yet I continued to smoke. But yesterday I went to God, and in five minutes it left me." I asked him, "Will you smoke again?" He said, "Of course I will! I will always smoke. Tsai-lin Shi will always smoke; he will smoke even five years or ten years from now. It is the Lord Jesus who stops me from smoking." He had truly overcome.</p><p>When I was in Chefoo, a sister came to me. I asked her, "Do you believe that you can overcome all the time?" She said, "I believe that I need some time to answer your question." Her words indicated that she was defeated already. Victory is not something that is proven over time. Victory is believing that the Lord lives in us and that He lives for us no matter what may happen. Victory depends on our letting go and our believing. If we are not victorious, it is either because we have failed to let go, or because we have failed to believe. If we have not failed in these two things, we will surely overcome.</p><p>The secret to victory lies in: (1) realizing that we cannot make it, (2) completely letting go, (3) seeing that the Lord can make it, and (4) having a living faith every day, believing that the Lord is living for us. When we rise up from our bed in the morning and are happy, we should believe that the Lord is living for us. When we rise up from our bed in the morning and are not happy, we should still believe that the Lord is living within us. If we do this, we will always live an overcoming and glorious life. Please remember that we have to commit ourselves to the Lord and put ourselves in His hand. We must believe that He has received us and will live out His overcoming life for us. We should not try to see if this works; rather, we should trust in Him fully and believe in Him absolutely. The Lord will work only when we trust in Him fully. We have to believe from our heart that the Lord will live for us at all times. If we do not fail in letting go and in believing, we will surely overcome.</p>
