   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that in the love of God, there is not only grace, but another great item as well, God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible puts much emphasis on mercy also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we have to admit that mercy is more particularly an Old Testament word, in the same way that grace is more particularly a New Testament word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that you will not find mercy in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if you have a cross-reference Bible or a concordance, you will find mercy in the Old Testament far more frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mercy is something of the Old Testament, in the same way that grace is something of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The outlet of love is either grace or mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mercy is negative, and grace is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mercy is related to the present condition, and grace is related to the future condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mercy speaks of the poverty of your present condition, and grace speaks of the bright condition that you will be saved into in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The feeling that God has toward us when we are sinners is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The work that God does upon us to make us the children of God is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mercy arises from our existing condition; grace arises from the work that we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not know if you are clear about this or not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose there is a destitute person here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You love him and have pity upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You feel sorry for his difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you did not love him, you would not suffer and grieve for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But by doing so, you are having mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But such mercy is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your mercy on him is in sympathy for his present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when is grace accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is accomplished when this person is rescued today out of his poor condition to a new position, to a new realm and a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only then does your love to him become grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why I say that mercy is negative and for today, while grace is positive and for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The future I am talking about is the future in this age, rather than the future in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not mean that the Old Testament speaks only about mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Old Testament speaks about grace, too.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not true that we no longer need mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No, we still need mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God was merciful in the time of the Old Testament, because His work was not yet completed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the Old Testament was full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God showed mercy for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But today, in the New Testament age, we have grace because the Lord Jesus has accomplished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has come to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, what we have received today is not mercy, but grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today is not a day of mercy, but a day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there were only mercy, we could only have hope.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament, there was only hope; hence, the Old Testament speaks of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But thank the Lord, today we have obtained what was hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need to hope for it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mercy comes from love and issues in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If mercy has not come from love, it will not issue in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since it originates in love, it arrives at grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Gospels there is the account of a blind man receiving his sight Mark 10:46-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he met the Lord, he did not say, "Lord, love me!" or "Lord, be gracious to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, he said, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" v. 48 . He asked for mercy because of his present condition, his present difficulty, and his present pain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He knew that if the Lord Jesus were to sympathize with him, He would not stop at showing mercy to him; He would surely do something.</S>
