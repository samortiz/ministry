   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET TO PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us use an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When parents teach their child to speak, they do not care whether he understands or not; they simply speak to him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the child may not understand at the very beginning, as long as the parents continue to speak to him, he will gradually understand in less than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps he will first learn to say, Mom, then, Dad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The parents do not need to tell him particularly that this is dad and that is mom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He spontaneously knows whom to call.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After some time he may learn to say, Love Mom!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How does he learn to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is through constant hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are dumb are usually deaf as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being deaf, they cannot hear and therefore cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, they become dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when we preach the gospel, we need to have the faith and boldness to speak God s word to people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not worry about whether they will understand or not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as they can hear, it will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should simply tell people, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People may not understand it the first or second time, or even after seven or eight more times, but eventually they will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, those in the Lord s recovery always use new terminology to speak the new language, such as the Spirit and the Triune God dispensing Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elderly saints can testify that it is the younger ones who learn these things first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the younger ones speak these things to them all the time, and eventually after hearing these things many times, the older ones also learn them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is just like the elderly Chinese people who live in the United States and learn to speak a few simple English sentences after hearing their grandchildren speak English.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the young people need to have the boldness to endeavor to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First you have to speak to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can tell them, I know more than you do concerning the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I know about the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit; I also know that Christ s humanity is mingled with divinity, that Christ s divinity is mingled with humanity, and that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I will speak these things to you every day; then eventually you will understand and be able to speak them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a blessing of life this would bring to your parents!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From now on we should not preach the shallow and superficial gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to preach the high and mysterious gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps it will not be easy for people to understand, but inwardly they will appreciate and respect it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once they appreciate and respect it, they will easily open their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The problem of our gospel preaching is not in people s inability to understand our preaching but in our inability to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is not that people cannot understand our preaching but that we only preach the superficial gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we preach the high gospel, we do not need to worry about people being unable to understand or believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In actuality, the problem is not that people cannot understand but that we do not know how to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LEARNING THE MYSTERY OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FOR THE PREACHING OF THE HIGH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the preaching of the high gospel, we have a strong burden to encourage everyone to pursue the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Texas there are some saints who put the life-studies everywhere in their home not only in the study, the living room, and the kitchen, but also in the bathroom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They make good use of their time to pursue the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some saints play message tapes in their cars and listen to them while driving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must have this kind of pursuing spirit in order to know the truth thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The truth is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This corresponds to the Chinese saying, What is real in a person will be manifested outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are filled with the truth inwardly, we will spontaneously express it outwardly by speaking the mystery of the gospel to people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all one day be able to speak the life-study messages even in our dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This would prove that the life-studies have been received and thoroughly constituted into us, because what we dream about at night is what we think about during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all have the heart to preach the gospel, but if we do not know the truth, we will quickly run out of words as soon as we open our mouths to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After two or three sentences we will not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the end, we will have nothing to say, and people will be unwilling to listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we must learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word of the gospel is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For us to speak the word of the truth, we must first learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If from now on we would be willing to seriously learn the truth, we all would know how to preach the gospel in two months.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To preach the gospel is actually to speak the truth, because the real gospel preaching is the speaking of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To speak the truth is to preach the gospel; thus, we all must learn the truth in a proper way.</S>
