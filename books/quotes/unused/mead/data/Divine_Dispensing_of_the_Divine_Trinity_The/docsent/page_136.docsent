   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MATURITY OF LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CONSTITUTION OF MINISTRY 5 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6, 8-9, 17-18; 4:4, 6-7, 16; 5:17; 10:1; 11:10.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>COMPETENT MINISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CONSTITUTED OF THE LIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 3:3 Paul says that the Corinthian believers were a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 3:6 Paul goes on to say, Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek words rendered made us sufficient may also be translated enabled us, qualified us, made us competent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God made the apostles competent, sufficient, as ministers of the new covenant, not of letter but of the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit in verse 6 is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles minister Christ into the believers to make them His living letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, the apostolic ministry for the New Testament is of the living Spirit, the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, as a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, their ministry is one constituted of the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not think that only the apostles are sufficient as ministers of a new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all are ministering ones, and God has made us competent to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has made us competent ministers not of a covenant of letters, but of a covenant of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, whatever we preach or teach should be a word constituted of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, suppose a brother works in an office.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His speaking to his colleagues about the Lord should not be a speaking apart from such a constitution of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his speaking he should give a testimony of what he has experienced of the Spirit, of how the Spirit has constituted him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we give this kind of testimony, we are ministering the new covenant, which is constituted of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if in our speaking we merely present doctrinal knowledge or theological teachings, what we are ministering may be compared to the Mosaic law, to a covenant without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to have, and we all can have, a share in the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the youngest among us may have such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to have this ministry, we need to have the experience of being constituted of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit, writing Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT IN GLORY AND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A MINISTRY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ABOUNDING IN GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:8 and 9 Paul says, How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ministry in verse 8 is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The glory in this verse is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles 4:6 , surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 9 Paul speaks of the ministry of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ministry of the old covenant became one of death v. 7 , because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death Rom 5:13, 18, 20-21 . Hence, it was also the ministry of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 9 Paul also speaks of the ministry of righteousness abounding in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ministry of the new covenant is one of the Spirit who gives life, because the new covenant brings in God s righteousness unto life Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, it is also the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory, but it also abounds in the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This glory surpasses that of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 3:8 and 9 we see that God has constituted the ministry of the Spirit in glory and of righteousness abounding in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to understand this, we need to consider Paul s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Paul came forth to preach the gospel according to God s New Testament economy, his way of preaching was different from the way Moses received the decree of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moses received the law, but he did not have any experience of what he received.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the book of Exodus, God simply gave the tablets of the law to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul s situation, however, was different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was zealous for the law and for Judaism, and he was absolutely opposed to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But one day the Lord Jesus appeared to him, and from that time onward Paul experienced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, he experienced Christ to such an extent that he was fully constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, his life was constituted a life of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When he received the commission to minister in the Gentile world, he did not go forth like Moses, who brought the tablets to the people in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, when Paul went out to preach the gospel, the gospel had been wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, what he spoke to others concerning the gospel was a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul was not a law-giver; he was a witness of Christ, for he had been constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was also a living expression of the gospel and of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As one who was living Christ, his ministry was a ministry of glory, a ministry full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say that his ministry was the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that the ministry that is full of the Spirit eventually becomes a ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we would understand this, we need to see that if we are not full of life, we cannot be right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Righteousness is a matter of being right, and righteousness comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are full of the divine life, then we shall be right, and we shall have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because the New Testament is a covenant of life, it makes people righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the ministry of this covenant is a ministry not only of the Spirit but also of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of the new covenant is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But as a ministry of righteousness, it abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be in glory is the initial stage, but to abound in glory is to be in glory continually.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First, Paul s ministry was of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As he carried out this ministry of the Spirit, it became the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, his ministry was in glory and also was abounding in glory.</S>
