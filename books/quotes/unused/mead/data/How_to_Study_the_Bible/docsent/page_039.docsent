   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Further on, we see in the book of Numbers that the Israelites passed through forty-two stations after their exodus from Egypt prior to their entry into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every station has its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In reading the names of the stations we get a picture of man's sojourning as well the condition for his entry into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The offerings, feasts, and ordinances regarding cleansing are all types, and we have to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Joshua is a book with profound types.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am not saying that all the types in this book are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am saying that there are many profound things in the book of Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to understand the significance of the Israelites entering Canaan and the warfare in Canaan, we must first know what Canaan typifies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some think that Canaan typifies heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if Canaan typifies heaven, will there be warfare in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are careful in our reading, we will conclude that Canaan cannot be a type of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a type of our heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the equivalent of the heavenlies spoken of in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, we wrestle against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In studying this typology, we must not stop with the book of Joshua; we must also study Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact, Joshua must be read not only with Ephesians but with Hebrews as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entrance into Canaan in the book of Joshua typifies two things: spiritual warfare in Ephesians and rest in Hebrews .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The rest here clearly refers to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Canaan is not a type of heaven but a type of the kingdom rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not everyone who passed under the blood of the lamb or ate of the Passover lamb entered Canaan; only two entered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rest died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many are called but few are chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, Canaan is a type of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entrance into Canaan typifies our reigning in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once we are clear about this fundamental point, we will see which part of Joshua is a type of a Christian's position in the heavenlies today and which part is a type of his reward in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The many lawless acts in the book of Judges typify man's self-willed life which results in all kinds of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Samuel we see man's reign and God's entrusting of His authority to man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before a man after God's heart was raised up, a man after man's heart stepped in. David was a man after God's heart, but before him, a man after man's heart, Saul, came.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is clear that Saul typifies the reign of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We see how the king after God's choice went into battle and how he enjoyed peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We see the battles of David and the glory of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reign of Saul typifies the condition during the great tribulation, the reign of David typifies the condition after the tribulation, and the reign of Solomon typifies the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of these are clear types.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Solomon's building of the temple is again a type of Christ building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The temple was in Jerusalem, typifying the church meeting and worshipping in the Lord's name, because God placed His name in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jerusalem was the only place which God recognized and in which He put His own name 1 Kings 14:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Jeroboam rose up, he set up altars in Bethel and Dan for worship, and God condemned this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God wants man to worship only at the place where His name is established.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not want man to worship anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During times of revival, the kings removed the altars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But some kings did not remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a type of the many revivals that have taken place in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, the temple was destroyed; this is a type of the church becoming desolated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Afterwards, Nehemiah, Zechariah, and Zerubbabel returned to rebuild the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the rebuilt temple was not as glorious as the one that had been destroyed, there was a beginning of recovery back to the original ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a type of the recovery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This recovery will be completed at the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the church will be a glorious church.</S>
