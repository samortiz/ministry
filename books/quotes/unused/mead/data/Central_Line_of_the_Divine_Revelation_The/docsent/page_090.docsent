   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this message we will cover the first thirteen items.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Christians are very familiar with the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I was saved, I spent time in the Gospel of John and discovered that there were many things in it that were difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had many questions which could not be answered even by the Christian workers, such as, What is the Word 1:1 ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is regeneration 3:6 ? and What is eternal life 3:16 ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, but we should not consider that it is a shallow or superficial book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a book that is full of depth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we need to "dive" into these depths and "mine" the treasures in the depths of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle John used very simple words and language in his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a strong characteristic of his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The language he used is simple, but the matters conveyed by his words are very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because many things in the Gospel of John are quite deep, few have spent the time to dig out the things in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thank the Lord that through the years, by reading their books, we have received help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible has been read again and again throughout the past twenty centuries by millions of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are standing on the shoulders of all the foregoing saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am grateful to the Lord that the top understanding of those in the past was preserved in their books.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, because of their writings we are able to know what the brothers in earlier years understood.</S>
