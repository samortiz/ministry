TO BE JOINED TOGETHER AND KNIT TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE GROUND OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>I will insert a word here concerning the ground of the church. At a time of chaos in the church, we must judge whether a meeting represents the church by its ground, not by its condition. A family may be in a poor and unsatisfactory condition, but this does not negate the standing of the family. A family may not be well off financially, but it still has the standing of a family. Even if another family is quite well off financially, we cannot take it as our family, because such a standing would be wrong. Family situations can change at any time, but its standing as a family never changes. Our family will always be our family. Being a family is based on standing, not on condition.</p>
<p>Similarly, the church is built on the ground of locality, which is expressed locally without any divisive element. Among the many so-called assemblies or gatherings in Christianity today, we must determine whether any represent the church by considering only their ground. If we make such a determination based also on spiritual condition, our determination will be based on relative conditions. For example, what is the basis for saying that a particular gathering is &ldquo;good&rdquo;? How do we measure &ldquo;good&rdquo;? Some meetings are in the &ldquo;heavens,&rdquo; some are in the &ldquo;air,&rdquo; and others are barely &ldquo;off the ground.&rdquo; There is no standard for &ldquo;good.&rdquo; In addition, that which is &ldquo;good&rdquo; often changes. Some meetings may have been very good several years ago but now are very bad. Furthermore, the meetings may be very good a year from now. The ground of locality, the ground of the church, however, is not at all affected by condition and can never be shaken. The local ground of oneness for the church is absolute. The condition of a local church may be completely different from one year to the next and from one month to the next. The condition of a church can rise and fall suddenly, but the ground does not change and cannot be lost.</p>
<p>Hence, we must pay attention to the matter of the ground. Our being joined together and knit together can occur only on the ground of oneness; we must avoid any &ldquo;joining&rdquo; that is based on something other than the ground of oneness. It is possible to be joined together and knit together only on the ground of oneness. We cannot destroy the ground of oneness merely for the sake of being &ldquo;joined&rdquo; with other brothers and sisters. When we find a meeting that is according to the ground of oneness, and we acknowledge that the meeting is on the ground of oneness, we should be joined together with these brothers and sisters. We cannot separate ourselves from them for any reason. As long as the ground is right, we must be willing to be built up with them no matter what their condition is.</p>
<p>Our being joined together and knit together with the saints must be based on the ground of oneness. Being properly joined together depends on the proper ground. If the ground of a gathering is wrong, the &ldquo;joining&rdquo; that occurs will be wrong, and if the ground is right, there can be no basis for separation. The brothers and sisters may feel that this is too strict, but it is the only practice that matches the truth. There is too much confusion related to the church. If we do not pay attention to the ground, we will tear down the church rather than build it up.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago in a church in northern China, a few were focused on spiritual pursuit to the point that they felt the church was lacking in spirituality and was only according to the will of man and the flesh. Consequently, these &ldquo;pursuers&rdquo; stopped coming to the meetings. Instead, they began to meet in a home. They said that when they met in a home, everyone touched their spirit and everyone said Amen to the prayers of those who were in their meetings. However, they said that when they met in the meeting hall, they felt oppressed and weighed down in their spirit as soon as they arrived and that they could not release their spirit in prayer. They left because they felt that the Lord was not present.</p>
<p>When I came to this locality, the &ldquo;pursuing&rdquo; brothers and sisters asked, &ldquo;What do you think, Brother Lee? Can we meet like this?&rdquo; I was very cautious and fearful lest I say too much and incite them even more toward a situation of division. I did not challenge them or rebuke them. I did, however, stand firm on one crucial point. I said, &ldquo;Brothers, if you are only having some prayer and pursuit at home for mutual encouragement, there is no problem with this in principle. But you can never establish another church or another table to break bread. There can be only one church in one locality; there can be only one church here. I cannot say that the church here is spiritual or perfect according to its condition, but one thing is certain: there is only one ground for the church. Therefore, we must honor the principle that God has ordained regardless of the condition of the church. There can never be two churches in one locality.&rdquo; I did not say who was right or who was wrong; I answered their question only by standing on the ground of the church. I said firmly that we could not divide a local church into two because of differences in spiritual pursuit. We should never do anything that tears down the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
