<h2 class=head3>4. Rescue the Believers in the Church in Thyatira</h2><p>The sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit works to rescue the believers in the church in Thyatira from idol worship, fornication, demonic teachings, and the deep things of Satan to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded with the authority over the nations in the kingdom age (2:18-29).<h2 class=head3>5. Revive the Believers in the Church in Sardis</h2><p>Christ’s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is to revive the believers in the church in Sardis from their dead and dying condition to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded with walking with the Lord in white and with not having their names erased from the book of life but confessed by the Lord before the Father and His angels in the kingdom age (3:1-6).<h2 class=head3>6. Encourage the Believers in the Church in Philadelphia</h2><p>Although Philadelphia is the best church, the believers there need to hold fast what they have that no one take their crown to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded to be a pillar in the temple of God with the name of God and the name of the New Jerusalem and the new name of the Lord written upon them in the kingdom age (3:7-13). The name which is upon them indicates that this is what they are. That means that they are the New Jerusalem, and they are God because they have God’s name upon them. Also, they are the Lord Jesus because they have His new name written upon them. Of course, their being God and the Lord Jesus is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.<h2 class=head3>7. Awake the Believers in the Church in Laodicea</h2><p>The believers in the church in Laodicea need to be awakened from their lukewarm and Christless condition. Thus, the Lord exhorts them to pay the price for the refined gold, white garments, and eyesalve and to open their door to the knocking Lord to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded to sit on the throne of the Lord in the kingdom age (3:14-22). They are not only lukewarm but also Christless because Christ is outside, knocking on the door of the church.<h2 class=head2>B. By:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Speaking of the Sevenfold Intensified Pneumatic Christ</h2><p>We are saved from degradation by the speaking of the unlimited, life-releasing, sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ (the Lamb with the seven Spirits as His eyes—Rev. 5:6). The seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ, who is the Lamb. No one can separate your eyes from your person. The sevenfold Spirit being the eyes of Christ indicates that they are one with Christ. The speaking of the sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle respectively becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally (Rev. 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22). At the beginning of each epistle Christ is speaking, and at the end the Spirit is speaking. This shows that Christ is the Spirit.
