   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE OUR COOPERATION AND GOD S OPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ROMANS EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever spent some time in Romans 8 to find out how many activities there are on God s side and how many activities there are on our side?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, this chapter does not stress how much God does, but rather it stresses how much we do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to consider some of the problems in Romans 8, but first we must spend some time to lay a foundation so that we may be enabled or qualified not to solve the problem, but at least to understand the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Understanding the problem sometimes is harder than solving the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best students are those who know how to question and how to find out the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The foundation we need to lay in order to understand further problems is to see what are the doings on our side and what are the doings on God s side in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OUR COOPERATION WITH GOD S OPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some might say first of all that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whose doing is this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It doesn t say God does this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then you may say it is the Spirit s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But neither does it say that the Spirit has freed us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it is a kind of law the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law here means a kind of law of nature, not the law of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, gravity is a law by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, such a law by nature was first set up by God, and God still operates it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the natural law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once a law is set, there is the need of the one who set the law to operate it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Gravity is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who is operating it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt it is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you believe that whenever the law of gravity operates, it needs God to operate it again and again and again?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law is there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But whether this law operates or not does not depend upon God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It depends upon our side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we would fulfill the requirement of that law, that law works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Electricity is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It has been installed into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you need heating, you don t need to telephone the power plant asking them to operate the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You just need to fulfill the requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you fulfill the requirement, the power operates.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is this your doing or the power plant s doing?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If this room is dark and we need light, do I need to kneel down and pray that God would send the light?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if I prayed for my whole life, the light would never come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if I just fulfill the little requirement of turning on the switch, light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whose doing is this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely this is our doing!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But don t say this is altogether your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before your doing, some work had been done already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some installation had been made already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some operating was taking place far away in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there had never been a kind of installation and if there were no power in the power plant, no operation in the power plant, although I switched on the switch a thousand times, nothing would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, this is my doing because I switched on the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But on the other hand, this is my doing plus the installation with the operation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I couldn t do the installation, nor could I do the operation of the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a kind of cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My switching on the switch is a kind of cooperation to the installation and the operation in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In traditional theology there are two schools: the Calvinist school and the Arminian school.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Calvinist school would say that everything is done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Arminian school would say that you have to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you don t do anything, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>SWITCHING ON</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul, though, said, Work out your own salvation Phil 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Apparently this is altogether against Martin Luther s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Salvation should be by faith, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet Paul says to work out your own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is just switching on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To work out your salvation is to switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has installed something, and God is still operating something, but you need to switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But who is this me?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is the switching me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It doesn t mean that the law of the Spirit of life frees every believer with no qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At least the one in Romans 7 was not freed; he was still struggling there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Until Paul reached chapter eight, the law had no way to work out something.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The law had been set up, and the law was still under God s operation, yet it needed Paul s switching on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Over fifty years ago I heard messages and I read books on this verse concerning the matter of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But no one ever told me that this law does not work without certain activities on the believers side.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually, Romans 8 is a definition of how the law of the Spirit of life is working.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The subject of Romans 8 is the freeing of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But just by verse 2, you don t know how the law of the Spirit of life works.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>So from verse 3 onward, nearly the entire chapter is a definition of how the law of the Spirit of life operates.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The law of the Spirit of life doesn t free everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many Christians today have not been freed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The law of the Spirit of life only frees certain believers who fulfill all the doings in this chapter.</S>
