   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Clothed in Purple and Scarlet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to verse 4, this woman is clothed in purple and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Purple signifies dignity with authority John 19:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This color is a blend of blue and red; it signifies the blending of heavenly things with earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the appearance of the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The woman is also clothed in scarlet, the characteristic of the apostate Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have already pointed out that the color scarlet is found everywhere in the Vatican.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most striking use of scarlet is in the garb of the cardinals, who have red hats and red robes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>H. Gilded with Gold, Precious Stone, and Pearls</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The woman is gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls v. 4 . Gold, precious stone, and pearls are the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built 21:18-19, 21 . But the woman, the apostate church, is not solidly built with these precious things as the New Jerusalem is; she is only gilded with these treasures as an ornament for outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is her deception to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the prostitute s false appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. Holding a Golden Cup</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prostitute holds in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication v. 4 . Gold in figure signifies the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the golden cup here means that the apostate church does have something of God in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But within, her golden cup is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication, full of idolatry, pagan practices, and filthiness in a heretical, sinful, religious relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>J. Drunken with the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of the Saints and Witnesses</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 6 says, And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the Roman Church has killed the saints and the witnesses of Jesus, having slain more of the saints than the Roman Empire did.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Roman Church does not kill the saints directly, but indirectly through the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, she is drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints are those who are separated, sanctified, unto God, living a holy life for God even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The witnesses are those who are a living testimony of the Lord Jesus, faithful also unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The witnesses of Jesus are also the saints; however, the saints may just live a separated and holy life, not complying with the apostate church; yet they may not stand out to testify against the apostasy of the Roman Church as did witnesses like Antipas 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The woman is drunken with the blood of both the saints and the witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>K. Materially Being the Great City</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The angel told the apostle John, And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth v. 18 . While the prostitute denotes the religious Babylon, signifying the Roman Church, the woman in this verse denotes the material Babylon, signifying the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is called the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When John wrote this book, Rome was the city that had a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What Antichrist and his ten kings will hate is the prostitute, the Roman Church, not the woman, the city of Rome, where their administration is based.</S>
