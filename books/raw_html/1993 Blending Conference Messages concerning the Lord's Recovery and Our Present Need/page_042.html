<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord Charging Us to Be in Harmony<br>When Two of Us Would Pray Together for Anything</H2><P>We all love the oneness, but we must realize that this oneness may be somewhat concealed in our spirit. This oneness must go a step further; it must be expressed. We need to apply the oneness. If we do not have the application, the oneness will be merely a doctrine and will remain hidden in our spirit. The world needs to see our oneness through our being in harmony and in one accord.</P><P>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord charged us to be in harmony when two of us would pray together for anything: "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens." In this verse the Lord used the word harmony, which is sumphoneo in Greek, meaning "to be in harmony, or accord" and referring to the harmonious sound of musical instruments or voices. In the eyes of the world, the harmony among us should be like an orchestra playing a harmonious melody.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The One Hundred Twenty Were Praying<br>for Ten Days with One Accord</H2><P>In Acts 1:14 the one hundred twenty disciples prayed for ten days with one accord, and their prayer was answered in a marvelous way on the day of Pentecost. In this verse another Greek word, homothumadon, is used for "one accord." This word is from homo, meaning "same," and thumos, meaning "mind, will, purpose (soul, heart)." It denotes a harmony of inward feeling in one's entire being. The one accord is the expression and the application of the oneness. The harmony in Matthew 18:19 is the one accord in Acts 1:14. In Acts 1:14 one hundred twenty saints were praying in one accord. However, before that time they were not in one accord. Before the Lord's death the disciples contended with one another (Luke 22:24) and had no strength to pray (Matt. 26:40-45). But after the Lord's resurrection something happened to them. In the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection, He came to the disciples and breathed into them the life-giving Spirit (John 20:22). This life-giving Spirit entered into the disciples essentially. This was the very dynamo that began to operate in them to bring them into one accord. Furthermore, the disciples were eyewitnesses of three marvelous things: Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ's ascension. This captured them to the uttermost. They forgot about all their own purposes and their own goals and came to pray in one accord to accomplish God's economy. After seeing these three things, they gave themselves for God's economy. How much we need to see these crucial things! That will cause us to lose heart for everything that entangles us and give ourselves to pray in one accord. The prayer in one accord was the base of God's move in the book of Acts. Eventually, God answered their prayer by the outpouring of the Spirit economically (Acts 2:2-4, 17). The Spirit was poured down due to their prayer in one accord. Through the outpouring of the Spirit the Jewish believers were baptized into one Body. This was all due to the prayer in one accord. This should impress us very much that the one accord among the saints is crucial for the carrying out of God's economy. The propagation of Christ in the book of Acts began with the one accord.</P><P>Through this one accord not only was the Spirit poured out, but also the word was given. On the day of Pentecost Peter, who had been cowardly before the Lord's crucifixion (Matt. 26:69-75) and had often spoken wrongly (Matt. 17:24-27; 26:35), boldly gave a clear word in which he explained the economical filling of the Spirit in a proper way (Acts 2:14-21), even quoting Joel 2:28-32. This also was due to the prayer in one accord and the Lord's answer. After his explanation Peter gave a very good message, and three thousand were saved (vv. 22-41). That increase came as a result of the prayer in one accord. According to verses 42-47, all the believers continued steadfastly with one accord in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. In such a one accord they began to practice having everything in common. They were always together expressing their oneness by being in harmony and by being in one accord.</P><P>Today we may have the oneness, but we need to arrive at the one accord. If we want the blessing, if we want the Spirit to be poured out and the word to be given for the increase of the church, we must pray in one accord.</P>
