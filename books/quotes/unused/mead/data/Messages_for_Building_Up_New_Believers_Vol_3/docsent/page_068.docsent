   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Believing That the Lord s Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Has Destroyed Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The manifestation of the Lord Jesus destroyed the works of the devil, and the death of the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord s death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 2:17 God spoke of death: For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This death is surely a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan was delighted at this word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since man would die if he ate the fruit, Satan tried his best to seduce man to eat it, so that death would reign in man and he could claim the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the Lord s death constitutes the greatest way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is true that God said, For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This death is punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord has another death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second death is a way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Death can punish those who sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Death can also save and deliver those who are in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan thought that death could only punish the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He seized upon this fact and reigned through man s death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, God saves and delivers man from sin through the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the most profound aspect of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s death on the cross takes away not only our sins but also the whole old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our old man has been crucified with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Satan reigns through death, the more he reigns through death, the worse his lot becomes, because his reign stops at death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we are already dead, death can no longer sting us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has no further reign over us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God said this so that man would not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But man ate it and sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What then should be done?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of sin is death; there is no way to change this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, there is a way to salvation, a salvation which goes through death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, the old creation and the old man were both crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that Satan s authority can only go as far as death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Scripture says, Through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are those who are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If Satan attacks us, we can say to him, I am already dead!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has no authority over us because we are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His authority extends only to the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our crucifixion with Christ is an accomplished fact; it is God s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible does not say that our death with the Lord is something that belongs to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not some experience that we hope to attain one day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible does not tell us to pursue death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It shows us that we are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person is not dead if he is still pursuing death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, our death with Christ is a gift from God in the same way that His death for us is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man is still pursuing crucifixion, he is standing on fleshly ground, and Satan has full control over those who stand on fleshly ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must believe in the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must also believe in our own death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Just as we believed in the Lord s death for us, so also we should believe in our death in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both are acts of faith, and neither has anything to do with human pursuits.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as we strive to realize these facts, we expose ourselves to Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to lay hold of the accomplished facts and declare: Praise and thank the Lord; I am already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must see that, in the eyes of God, our death with Christ is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we see this, Satan can no longer do anything with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Satan can deal only with those who are not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He can rule over only those who are facing death and who are on their way to death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we are no longer facing death; we have already died.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Satan can do nothing about us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to withstand Satan, we must realize that the Lord s manifestation was a manifestation of authority, and the work of His cross has released all those who are under Satan s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan no longer has any authority over us anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are above him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are those who are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan s way is terminated by death, and there is nothing more that he can do.</S>
