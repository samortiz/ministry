   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we experience Christ in such a way, we recover our faith in Christ signified by the gold, the Lord Himself is our approved conduct signified by the white garments, and we receive our sight to see the deep things of God and the spiritual things concerning Christ indicated by the eyesalve.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The people of God in the Old Testament were supposed to eat the tree of life in the garden, they ate the hidden manna in the wilderness, and they enjoyed the good land with all of its riches as a feast.</S>
