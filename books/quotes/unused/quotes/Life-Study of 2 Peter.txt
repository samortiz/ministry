In other words, if we would carry out God's government, we need God's provision; that is, we need the divine supply
We may say that the new heaven and new earth are represented by Peter and that the old universe is represented by Simon
The word 'slave' indicates Peter's submission to the Lord, and the word 'apostle,' the Lord's commission to him
In 1 Peter 1:1, Peter refers to them as 'the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia'
It was through the Urim and the Thummim that Joshua came to know God's instructions concerning which lot should go to each tribe
We know that the good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ
As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers
In the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us
If Christ is merely Christ to us and not also faith, we would not be able to participate in Him or share in Him
Please remember that our allotment comprises all things relating to life and godliness, including the divine nature partaken of by us
Our portion includes the divine nature, of which we partake through the common faith, which is equally precious
We have been allotted like precious faith in the sphere of or by means of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ
The righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, is an important matter that requires a proper understanding
From what Paul says in Romans we can see that the righteousness of God is one thing and that the righteousness of Christ is another
Here Peter combines these two kinds of righteousness when he speaks of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ
His righteousness is not only the righteousness of God or the righteousness of Christ it is the righteousness of both our God and our Savior
Through His crucifixion, Christ accomplished propitiation for the sins of the whole world and made it possible for us to be justified by God
By this we see that in 1:1 two kinds of righteousness-the righteousness of God and the righteousness of Christ- are put together
Peter's word concerning the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, is rich in what it indicates and implies
The common thought among the Jews at Peter's time was that God gave them certain blessings for their enjoyment
It is not according to this kind of righteousness, the righteousness of the law, that God has allotted us our New Testament portion
The righteousness of God is versus our own righteousness, and the righteousness of Christ is versus the righteousness of the law
We need to be clear that the portion, the allotment, is one thing and that this twofold righteousness is another thing
We have seen that the New Testament inheritance is all things relating to life and godliness, including the divine nature
It is in this righteousness and by this righteousness that God has allotted us equally our New Testament inheritance'
Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth , which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it
It brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all with itself subjective to us in our experience
When the light brings the scenery to the film within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to it
Let us take as an illustration the substantiating of the existence of a wooden table by a blind man through his sense of touch
The Bible is not merely a book of doctrine; it is a revelation of the truth, which is the reality of the content of God's dispensation
We see once again that faith is the substantiation of the substance of the reality of the New Testament dispensation
We have seen that this is actually the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as our life within and godliness without
In the Life-study of 1 Timothy we pointed out that the faith is the content of the complete gospel according to God's New Testament economy
The faith is objective, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:19; 2:7; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Timothy 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; and Titus 1:13
The truth is the reality of the content of the faith as mentioned in 1 Timothy 24 7 315 43 65 2 Timothy 215 18 25 37 8 44 Titus 11 and 14
Godliness is a living that is the expression of God as mentioned in 1 Timothy 22 10 316 47 8 54 63 5 6 11 2 Timothy 35 12 Titus 11 and 212
Subjective faith is the response to the truth of the objective faith; it receives and participates in the divine realities
Faith implies all the items in the 'scenery' of the New Testament inheritance according to the New Testament economy
We heard the preaching of the gospel, there was a 'click' of the shutter of the 'camera,' and the light came into us
Even if we try to change our minds, we cannot remove the scene that has been impressed on the 'film' of our spirit
We all have had the experience of the divine scenery being impressed on the film of our spirit through the click of the camera
In verse 2 Peter goes on to say, 'Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord'
Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament
The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation and enjoyment in His divine life and divine nature
It is in contrast to the killing knowledge of the human logic of philosophy, which invaded the church in its apostasy
Chapter two shows that this Epistle like 2 Timothy 2 John 3 John and Jude was written in the time of the churchs degradation and apostasy
The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies
It was not the exercise of partaking of the tree of life that gives life, but of participating in the tree of knowledge that brings in death
These are the substance of our faith's substantiation allotted to us by God as our portion for our inheritance
Life is the inward energy, inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to glory and results in glory
Without the imparting through the divine power there would be no way for grace and peace to be multiplied to us
It also means on account of, on the basis of, because of, and here is used in the instrumental sense becoming causal
All these promises are being carried out in His believers by His life-power, as the excellent virtue, unto His glory
Although we have been called into God's glory and virtue, are we actually in this glory, and are we participating in this virtue?
Regeneration is unto the enjoyment of the riches of the divine life, and the riches of this life are the divine nature
As He is being conveyed into those who listen to the preaching of the Word, He works within them as the Spirit
The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us
When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us
Concerning the things related to life and godliness, including the divine nature, the promises actually are the will
If we did not have the New Testament, which is a new will, how would we know what God has promised us concerning our inheritance?
According to verse 3, the Lord has called us not only by His glory and virtue, but also to His glory and virtue
The disciples were in a situation that was full of glory and full of virtue, the very glory and virtue to which they had been called
Because we all have been called to glory and virtue, God has given us promises in order that He may work out this virtue and glory for us
Because of, on account of, on the basis of, the fact that God has called us to His glory and virtue, He has given us promises
He has called us to His glory and virtue and He has given us the promises for the purpose that we may enjoy the divine nature
During the entire course of our Christian life on earth and even in eternity, we shall still be partaking of the divine nature
The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we have holiness, love, righteousness, kindness, and all manner of divine attributes
Becoming a partaker of the divine nature has a condition, and this condition is that we escape the corruption which is in the world by lust
God has given us promises that He will work out the virtue and glory so that we may partake of the divine nature
God has allotted to us a portion that includes the divine life and all things pertaining to life and godliness
We have seen that the divine nature denotes what God is, that it includes the ingredients, the constituents, of God's being
We, the regenerated ones, are the same as God in life and nature, but we are not the same as God in position in the Godhead
Daily we should partake of the divine nature and enjoy what God is, the contents, the ingredients, of His being
We enjoy the divine nature by the full knowledge of the One who has called us by His glory and virtue and to His glory and virtue
We need to escape the corruption that is in the world by lust; that is, we need to abstain from lustful living
As we enjoy God's nature, a part of this nature becomes our holiness, and other parts become our humility, love, kindness, and other virtues
It would, of course, be something that is for us, but it would not be able to reach us, and we would not be able to reach it
According to 1:1, the precious faith has been allotted to us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ
The Lord's death on the cross was in absolute obedience to God and fulfilled all the requirements of God's righteousness
Grace is our enjoyment of our portion of the New Testament inheritance, which is actually the processed Triune God
In verse 1 the sphere is a twofold righteousness, and in verse 2 the sphere is the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature
As we have pointed out, this is not simply a mental knowledge; it is experiential knowledge in our spiritual understanding and apprehension
The full knowledge of God and of Christ is a deep, practical, thorough, and experiential knowledge of God and our Lord
Grace and peace have come to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the New Testament inheritance
The pronoun 'His' is singular, but in verse 2 there are two antecedents of this pronoun-God and Jesus our Lord
We have seen that grace is multiplied as, or according as, His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness
If we are faithful to take in the Word by drinking it as pure milk , we shall experience an inward spiritual multiplication of grace
Everything pertaining to life and godliness has been given to us by the divine power, and the precious promises have also been given to us
We have pointed out that the divine power in verse 3 is the power of the divine life related to the divine nature
How much more power was necessary to raise Christ to the third heaven, to the center and height of the universe!
In 2 Peter 1:3, Peter says that this divine power has granted us all things which relate to life and godliness
All things have been given, imparted, infused, into us so that we may live the divine life and also live out this life
If we do not pass through the process to gain the full knowledge, it will seem that what the divine power has planted in us has been in vain
Peter does not say that God has called us to heaven, nor even that He has called us to redemption or sanctification
We definitely need the full knowledge of the One who has called us for the purpose of bringing us into His glory and virtue
Even though this power is great, it will not be able to work in us if we do not fulfill the conditions for its operation
Although the divine power is present and is working, it does not operate in those who do not render the proper cooperation
Peter is saying that through the divine glory and virtue God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises
There is the need of God's word of promise to assure us, encourage us, strengthen us, and speed us on our way toward this goal
If heaven were the goal of God's calling, we could simply be happy and rejoice, live according to our pleasure, and then wait for heaven
Knowing our need for assurance, encouragement, and strength, God has given us precious and exceedingly great promises
Through the glory and virtue which are the goal to which we have been called, God has given us the promises we need
The Lord's promises encouraged Peter and the other disciples on their way toward the goal of God's glory and virtue
He leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God'
By means of the Lord's promises the early disciples were encouraged to press on to reach God's glory and attain the divine virtues
According to 2 Peter 1:4, God has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises for a specific purpose
Just as we are constituted physically of the food we eat, so the disciples were constituted of the God of which they partook
Of course, we shall never become God in the sense of attaining to the Godhead or becoming an object of worship
God's purpose in giving us the precious and exceedingly great promises is that we may become partakers of the divine nature
In 1:4 there is a condition for becoming partakers of the divine nature: it is 'having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust'
The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust
Verse 5 says, 'And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge'
In verse 6 Peter continues, 'And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness'
Self-control, or temperance, is the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits
In order to live a proper Christian life, we need endurance toward those around us and also toward our environment and circumstances
If faith is the seed, virtue and knowledge the roots, self-control the trunk, then endurance and godliness are the branches
The Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature
Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love, to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love
As we have seen, faith may be considered the seed of life, and this nobler love, the fruit in its full development
Peter's thought in chapter one of his first Epistle is that the full salvation of the Triune God issues in holiness and brotherly love
According to some translations, the word love in 2 Peter 1:7 indicates a love not only for Christian brothers but for all men
As God sends rain upon both the just and the unjust, so we should love not only our brothers but also our enemies
In the church life we may prefer a certain brother whom we regard as nice and love him, but we may not appreciate another brother as much
When we have this kind of love, we love all the brothers the same, no matter what kind of brothers they may be
It denotes the existence of certain things that belong to someone from the beginning and thus become his rightful possession to the present
In the New Testament we are not exhorted to correct ourselves: we are exhorted to be constituted of the elements of the divine nature
Confucius may have taught people to improve, but he certainly did not teach them to be constituted of the divine nature
Being constituted of a particular element implies that something is about to be added to us that we do not already possess
We have seen that we need to develop in our faith virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love
Now that we have been regenerated, we need to be reconstituted; that is, we need to be constituted of the elements of the divine nature
The Greek word rendered 'shortsighted' comes from the root word that means to close the eyes due to strong light; hence, to be shortsighted
To be diligent is to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life
If we are diligent to develop the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7, we shall confirm, make sure, our calling and selection
If we develop these virtues and are constituted of them, we shall have the confirmation that we have been called and selected
To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God's eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ
Peter 1:11 indicates that we may have an entrance richly and bountifully supplied into the kingdom of our Lord
In verse 5 Peter says And for this very reason also adding all diligence supply bountifully in your faith virtue and in virtue knowledge
The word 'virtue' refers to the virtue mentioned in verse 3, where Peter speaks of the One who has 'called us to His own glory and virtue'
The virtue in verses 3 and 5 is the issue of the experience of the divine nature, the enjoyment of the divine nature, in verse 4
When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues
Such a word concerning the processed God may sound alien or strange to those who have only a superficial knowledge of the Word
In verse 6 Peter goes on to say, 'And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness'
As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance
We need to have endurance with the members of our family, with our neighbors, and with various things that disturb us
We have pointed out that in godliness, the expression of God, brotherly love, which is brotherly affection, needs to be supplied
We do not have the wisdom to love them in a way that will enable them to receive the life supply and be nourished
God's love is not only nourishing, but also contains a spiritual antibiotic that fosters healing and prevents illness
If you love him with this kind of love, he will receive the life supply and an antibiotic that can kill the 'germs' within him
We need to learn to love the brothers with this divine love, not with the love that depends on the tide of our emotions
As a result, we shall be full of Christ, and, in Paul's words, we shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The divine provision includes two matters: the impartation of the divine power and the shining of the divine truth
By 'the present truth' Peter means the truth which is present with the believers and which they have already received and now possess
To put off the tabernacle is to put off the body, to be unclothed of the body , to leave the body, to die physically
To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord's coming sounded very much like a myth or superstitious tale
Here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
Peter considers the Lord's transfiguration as a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36
The Lord's coming back in glory will also be a fact as real as His transfiguration, and Peter will also be in it
In Luke 9:26-36 the Lord Jesus also indicated that His transfiguration was a figure of His glory in His coming back
These heretics and apostates regarded the teaching that the Lord would come back in glory to judge the earth as a superstitious tale
Some Modernists think that the children of Israel walked through shallow water, water that was made shallow by the blowing of a strong wind
They explain this by saying that those in the crowd brought food with them and simply ate whatever they had brought
They claim that He died on the cross not for our redemption, but as a sacrifice for the kind of ism in which He believed
We saw the Lord Jesus transfigured, and we know that as He was glorified in His transfiguration, so He will come again in glory
The Greek words rendered 'dark place' may also be translated murky place, a place that is squalid, dry, and neglected
Peter says that we do well to give heed to the prophetic word until the day dawns and the morning star arises in our hearts
They have been enlightened by the shining of the prophetic word, which is able to lead them to the dawning day
Eventually, this light will shine until a spiritual day dawns within us, and a morning star rises in our hearts
Our experience confirms the fact that in 1:19 Peter is speaking both of a spiritual day and the day of the Lord's coming
Spontaneously we had the sense that no longer were we in the night but in the day, for a spiritual day had dawned within us
As we have pointed out, the dawning day in 1:19 also refers to a future day when the Lord Jesus will come back as the Sun of righteousness
In verse 20 Peter continues, 'Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of one's own interpretation'
Literally, the Greek word for 'interpretation' means loosening, untying; hence, disclosure, exposition, solution
One's own interpretation means the prophet's or writer's own exposition or solution, which is not inspired by God through the Holy Spirit
Verse 21 says, 'For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit'
The source is God, by whose Holy Spirit men were carried along, as a ship by the wind, to speak out the will, desire, and wish of God
Because the prophets were carried along by the Holy Spirit, what they uttered was not of their own interpretation or will
What they spoke was the will of God, the concept of God uttered by a prophet who was carried along by the Holy Spirit
Do not listen to the heretical teachings of the apostates, of those who have deviated from the track of divine truth
In 2:1 Peter says that there will be also false teachers among us, those who will secretly bring in destructive heresies
Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared
It denotes the false and heretical doctrines brought in by the false teachers, the heretics, similar to the doctrines of today's Modernism
A type of Modernism that was prevailing fifty years ago was called Buchmanism, after a man named Buchman, a professor at Oxford University
When we were in China, we criticized this book and opposed it because it did not say anything concerning the blood of Jesus
In this Epistle Peter uses three different Greek words concerning the consequence of the apostasy under God's judgment
Its significance can be further seen in Romans 821 1 Corinthians 317 1533 2 Corinthians 72 113 Galatians 68 Revelation 1118 and 192
In verse 2 Peter continues, 'And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled'
The way of the truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament
Because of this, the God of justice and holiness has begun His governmental judgment from His own household-the believers
Noah did not preach the gospel, but he preached God's righteousness over against the corruption of his generation
In verses 7 and 8 Peter says, 'And rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless '
In verses 7 and 8 Peter uses the word 'righteous' three times in speaking of righteous Lot, that righteous man, and his righteous soul
The unrighteous ones who lived at the time of Noah and Lot must still face the judgment at the great white throne
lordship' must refer to the lordship of Christ, which is the center of the divine government, dominion, and authority
In verse 11 Peter continues Whereas angels being greater in strength and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord
Because Michael realized that in the angelic order the Devil was higher than he, he did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him
To refrain from bringing a reviling judgment against them before the Lord is to keep the order of authority in God's government
Some have 'ceased from feeling' by giving up the consciousness of their conscience through their denial of God
The first century heretics, like the Sadducees in ancient Judaism and the Modernists of today, are in this category
The word 'for' literally means unto and indicates that they are destined to be captured for corruption, to be made slaves of corruption
By the supply of life through the divine provision we are able to escape this corruption that brings in destruction
The lust-indulging heretics are to genuine believers, who are God's treasure, like spots and blemishes to precious gems
Verse 17 continues, 'These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been kept'
They are waterless clouds carried along by winds , having nothing of life to meet the need of the thirsty ones
The God-denying heretics eventually become like these dirty animals, making themselves filthy both inwardly and outwardly
Because the defilement of the false teachers is very contagious, the believers' contact with them is prohibited
We have seen that in 2:10-22 Peter exposes the evils of the false teachers and their punishment under God's judgment
Five books-2 Timothy, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude-were written during a time of the church's degradation in apostasy
According to the Bible, we believe in transformation and in being constituted of the element of God for the rearrangement of our being
These mockers may be the false teachers themselves or those who are influenced by the teachings of the false ones
Peter uses both to confirm and strengthen his writings as an inoculation against the heretical teachings in the apostasy
Peter's teaching is based upon the prophets of the Old Testament and the apostles of the New Testament, the two sections of the Holy Word
Verse 3 says, 'Knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts'
Peter points out that the mockers willingly ignore the record in the Old Testament concerning God's judgment by the flood
The heretical mockers ignore willfully and deny purposely the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures
Peter reminds the believers to remember the holy words spoken by both the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles
The mockers should be assured that by the word of God all the material universe, including them, will be judged by the coming of the Lord
The first judgment on the world was the one executed by the flood in Noah's day, which cleared up that ungodly world
It implies that this age of apostasy will also be judged on the day of the Lord's appearing, as it was judged in the day of Noah
The word 'flooded' in verse 6 refers to the flood of Noah's time, the flood that caused the earth to be destroyed
The earth, therefore, did not remain the same, but had a change, a cataclysm, by being flooded with water, and was destroyed
Since it will be the final judgment upon men and demons, it is of the greatest concern to the government of God in the universe
Peter skips over the millennium, the period of time from the Lord's coming to the judgment of the great white throne
Peter says that the Lord does not delay, or is not tardy, regarding the promise, as some count delay, tardiness
We need to realize that the Lord's heart is not set on the time of the fulfillment of His promise, but is set on His people
Some Bible teachers claimed that, according to their view of the world situation, the Lord's coming was at hand
Because the bride is not yet ready, we may say that it is possible that the Lord's coming will not be as soon as some figure
The first one and a half chapters of 1 Peter and the first half of chapter one of 2 Peter are important in this regard
In this message we shall consider 3:10-12, where Peter speaks concerning God's judgment on the heavens and the earth
Although these verses are not directly related to the growth in life, they may help us to pursue the growth in life
If we have a thorough study of both the Old and New Testaments, we shall see that the day of the Lord will probably last about seven years
The first sixtynine weeks a period of four hundred eightythree years ended when the Lord Jesus was crucified when He the Messiah was cut off
We do know that after this interval, there will be a period of seven years, which will be the seventieth week, before the millennium
It will probably begin from the time the Lord leaves the throne of God in the third heaven and descends to the air wrapped in a cloud
We need to notice the fact that the man-child will be raptured not to the air, but to the throne of God, where the Lord Jesus is today
For the manchild to be raptured to the throne of God means that the manchild will be in the presence of the Lord in the parousia of the Lord
These will be the first ripe ones in God's field and will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb
These chapters give us the ground to say that, at the earliest, the parousia of the Lord will begin from the middle of the seventieth week
The best way to translate 2 Thessalonians 2:8 is to follow a literal rendering and speak of the appearing of His coming
If we have at least a general idea concerning the Lord's coming, we shall know why Peter says that the day of the Lord will come as a thief
The day of the Lord will come before the millennium, but the burning of the heavens will be after the millennium
During this period of time, God will judge heaven, earth, and those living on earth, according to what is written in the book of Revelation
In the middle of the seventieth week the man-child and the one hundred forty-four thousand will be raptured to the third heaven
The Lord will also cause Satan to be bound and cast into the abyss, where he will be kept for a thousand years
At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released from his prison and will instigate the rebellion of Gog and Magog
After this, the day of the Lord will be completed, and eternity will be ushered in with the new heaven and the new earth
All things, both in the heavens and on the earth, have been defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fall of men
How wonderful that the divine power has provided us with all things that are needed to live such a life in the holy manner and godliness
While we live a transformed life in a holy and godly manner, we are expecting, awaiting, and hastening the coming of the day of God
The day of God is the day of the Lord , and the day of the Lord is the day of Jehovah to the children of Israel in the Old Testament
Will come the final judgment upon men and demons, and probably also the fallen angels, at the great white throne
Because the judgment of the great white throne will still be executed by the Lord Jesus , it will also be in the day of the Lord
Peter says that 'the heavens, being set on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements burning with intense heat are melted'
In 3:13 Peter says, 'But according to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells'
Because this Epistle is on the government of God, eventually it tells us that there will be a new universe where righteousness will dwell
Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God's governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation
The heretics, who forsake the straight way and follow the way of unrighteousness , are spots and blemishes among the believers
In order to prepare for the coming judgment, we should not only be found in peace, but we should also be saved from destruction
The mockers count, or consider, the Lord's longsuffering toward the believers as delay, tardiness, or slackness
The Lord has delayed His coming with the intention that many of His elect may not miss the topmost portion of His full salvation
Paul as another of the apostles also teaches the same thing in his writings, which are based upon the prophetic word of the Old Testament
God the Father has chosen a people in eternity according to His foreknowledge and has called them to His glory
The Triune God's divine power has provided them with all things relating to life and godliness , guarding them unto full salvation
The new heavens and the new earth will come as a new universe, in which God's righteousness will dwell for eternity
For Peter to make such a commendation is a great thing, for it was he who was rebuked by Paul to his face regarding the New Testament faith
In 3:16 Peter says that the unlearned and unstable twist Paul's writings and also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction
According to the context destruction in verse 16 refers not to eternal perdition but to the punishment of the divine governmental discipline
The Greek word rendered 'carried away' here is the same word used in Galatians 2:13 concerning Peter, Barnabas, and other Jewish believers
At the beginning of this Epistle Peter speaks of grace, and now at the end he charges us to grow in this grace
The realization of the knowledge of our Lord equals truth, the reality of all that He is, as in John 1:14 and 17
Since such a praise is one that is rendered to God , this indicates that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is God
