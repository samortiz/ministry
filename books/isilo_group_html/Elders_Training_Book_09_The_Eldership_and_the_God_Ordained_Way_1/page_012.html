In other words, we need to go to those close to us, that is, our relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates. Instead of going to visit people with the gospel, however, we have picked up much of Christianity's way. We invite the sinners to come to us, instead of our going to them. The way that we have taken to meet and to serve in the past, in many respects, has been wrong. We must take the God-ordained, organic, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>Recently I told some of the brothers that I was like Gideon looking for the three hundred to be in one accord with me for the Lord's move (Judg. 7:7). I only care for one thing&#151;to carry out what the Lord has charged us to do. We all need to rise up and put everything of the unscriptural practice of Christianity under our feet. The number one thing we should do in these days is to visit people in their homes. This is to follow the pattern of the Lord Jesus. We must go to visit people. We do not necessarily need to go to Africa or Mongolia. We can go next door to our neighbor. We can go to the homes of our relatives to bring the living Christ to them. We have the high gospel, the rich truth, and the wonderful life of Christ to minister to people.</P><P>After setting up home meetings with the new believers, we have to teach them the truth. We can use appropriate portions of our publications for this purpose. Now is the time for us to go out and send the truth to people's homes. Then the ones in these homes will be brought into functioning. They will talk about the divine truths. We need to impress the new ones that they can practice the church life in their homes.</P><P>I want to take the new way, the God-ordained way. In the new way, we have to be raised up to spread the gospel by visiting people. The elders need to forget about spending much of their time to work for the church at a desk in their office. They should go out to preach the gospel and baptize people. One leading brother told me that in the past twenty years he had not brought one person to Christ. Within a short time after coming back from the full-time training in Taiwan, however, he baptized seventeen people. Another brother who went to Taiwan knocked on a particular door, and the gentleman said that he was not interested. Then this brother went to the back of the house and knocked on the kitchen door. The gentleman said again that he was not interested, and he told the brother that he could not come in. Then the brother said, "Okay, I won't come in. You come out." This brother had the authority of Christ. That gentleman came out, and the brother read a few pages of The Mystery of Human Life with him. Then that man received the Lord, and was baptized in his bathtub.</P><P>These experiences show that we need to forget about the traditional way of Christianity and come back to the scriptural way. Christianity has misled us and given us the wrong impression. We have received a wrong understanding of the Lord's move. We do not need to wait to form a mission, raise up funds, and send missionaries to go to Africa. We can be missionaries to our neighbors right away. We need to budget our time to visit people with the gospel. We need to have a revolutionized church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
