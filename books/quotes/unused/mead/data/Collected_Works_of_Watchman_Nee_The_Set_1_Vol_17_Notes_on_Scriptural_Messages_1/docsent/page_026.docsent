   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many believers and many of God's children are waiting for our help.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one thing among us which I feel is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The modernists speak much with their mouths concerning service, but they do not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This obviously is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But for us, we have neglected too much the matter of doing good and helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is most pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should seek for opportunities to do good to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two years ago there was an unusual article in the news in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man had gone to work in some place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After he finished his work, he took a train home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he was not far away from his home, he made a long distance telephone call to his wife, which cost him thirteen dollars and sixty-five cents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When his wife answered the call, she thought that he was in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he said only, "I still love you."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His wife marveled that he would spend so much money to say these few words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he reached home, his wife asked him concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He replied, "I was afraid that I might die on the way and not reach home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So I called first to tell you those words."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a woman who suffered from tuberculosis and was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Her husband was there and the doctor told him that his wife was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The husband then spoke to his wife, "If you die, I do not know what I will do because I really love you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His wife replied, "Everything would have been fine if you had told me this earlier."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She said this because his conduct toward her before had caused her to doubt his love and had depressed her to the point that she had fallen sick.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mr. Panton said, "Take the opportunity today to speak a little word of kindness, a word of praise, and a word of appreciation."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a very famous literary person in England.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His relationship with his wife had been cold for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day, his wife died.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he arrived home he spoke to the dead body, "I wish you had lived for another five minutes so that I could have had the opportunity to tell you that even though our relationship was so distant these many years, my heart has never left you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not take the opportunity to love others today and to do good to them, we will regret it one day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we learn to forgive others today, and may we learn to love others and to speak a kind word to them today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Third, we have to help other people with our money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A rich man said, "Whenever there is money it should be given away."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that your money can be saved for some better use in the future, and that you will give more money when there is a better use.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the "good use" of the present time is better than the "better use" of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people want to save fifty or a hundred dollars and take it out when there is a real need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I must tell you that you may not be able to take it out on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why not give the ten, twenty, or thirty cents to the beggar today?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps when the real need comes, it will already be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What does it say in the Gospel of Luke concerning the deeds of the unfaithful steward?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He took advantage of his position while he was still the steward to speak to the man that owed his master a hundred measures of oil, "Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty" 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And to the one who owed his master one hundred measures of wheat he said, "Take your bill and write eighty" v. 7 . He did not wait until he was out of his stewardship to do all this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To wait until he was no longer the steward would have been too late.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through this incident, the Lord taught the disciples to seize the opportunity to gain friends, that is, friends in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, this is what we should learn today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Take the opportunity today to use the three or five dollars you still possess for the work of the Lord, for the poor believers, and for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the streets we meet poor people; in the meetings we come across poor believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the ability, we should take the opportunity to do good to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>NOT LEAVING THE OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The above speaks of taking the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is also another aspect, which is what Romans 13:14 says: "Make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts," and what Ephesians 4:27 says, "Neither give place to the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only do we have to seize the opportunity, but we have to avoid giving opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only do we have to take the opportunity to love God and man, but we should not give any opportunity to the flesh or the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The cause of the sin of the first man was due to his speaking a word incorrectly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not wish to give any opportunity to the flesh or to the devil, there is only one way, which is to say "no."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we say "no" the right way, everything will be well, but if we say it the wrong way, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, if a young man was invited out to carouse with others, and his first word was "no," everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have a younger brother whose friends often invited him to play.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I told him that he did not have to involve himself with whatever was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He only muttered something without saying yes or no. If you can say "no" as the first word, the second word will be easy, and the third will be even easier.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you dare not say "no" on the first hand, your heart is shaken already.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Initially, your conscience may not agree; but in the end you may not even care for your conscience anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do not resist the first time, you will fail the second and third time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people overcome because they will say "no" the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These people will not be sought after by others because the others know that they will refuse anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many brothers and sisters fail because they will not say "no" at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore they are wearing what they should not wear, eating what they should not eat, doing what they should not do, and going where they should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Two weeks ago I read a magazine in which an old man wrote an article which said that if a young man does not know how to say "no," he should go to the wilderness and repeatedly say "no" until his tongue obeys him and is able to say "no."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course, when we say "no," we should be polite, courteous, and respectful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the Bible there was a man who certainly knew how to say "no."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That was John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the Jews sent some to ask him whether or not he was the Christ, he replied, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because of such a clear word, a great deal of trouble was avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If he had replied a little ambiguously, he would have been able to gain a little glory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But he preferred to lower his status by saying "no," saving himself a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eve failed because she spoke one word after another.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I know a number of brothers and sisters who fell because they could not say the first word, "no."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the end, it was too late even when they wanted to say "no."</S>
