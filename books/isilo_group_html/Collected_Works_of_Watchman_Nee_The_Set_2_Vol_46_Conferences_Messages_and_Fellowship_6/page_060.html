In the first chapter of Revelation we see Christ as the Lord of war, not as the Head of the church or as the Savior. Previously, John laid on His bosom, now he lay as dead at the feet of the Lord. The Lord is revealed as a man of war. Out of His mouth proceeds a sword, and His eyes are like a flame of fire. He is a Lamb who is filled with wrath. In Revelation we see two thrones at war. Heaven and hell are in conflict. They are fighting to obtain the worship of man. Revelation 1&mdash;3 reveals Him as Lord, the One to be worshipped. Chapters four and five are not prophetic; they do not speak of future things; rather, they are a picture of the eternal scene in heaven (Rev. 4:1-4, 6, 9-11; 5:6, 12-14). In heaven there is only one throne, which is for worship.</p><p>Everything has its beginning from the throne. John saw the throne and the One seated there who was worthy of all praise. The throne has never changed. The elders represent all spiritual beings and the four living creatures represent the whole creation. (The twenty-four elders are not part of the church. The number of the church is twelve, not twenty-four. The elders also have crowns and thrones, and they were enthroned and crowned before the Lamb was. If it was possible for the church to be enthroned and crowned before the Lamb, then the twenty-four elders could represent the church. However, the church was never enthroned and crowned before the Lord was; therefore, we cannot say that the twenty-four elders represent the church.)</p><p>Since the sphere is the universe, the twenty-four elders are the twenty-four elders of the universe. The church is "the brothers of the Lord"! David set up twenty-four groups to minister to God, so the twenty-four elders are a band who serve God. They are kings and priests, and they represent the angels. They are a special group who serve God.</p><p>The living creatures represent all of God's creation, including man. This picture shows us that from eternity to eternity God has His throne and continual worship. In zoology we have men, domestic animals, beasts, birds, fish, and creeping things. In Genesis 1:24-26 we also have six kinds of creatures: man, cattle, beasts, fowl, fish, and creeping things. Only four are represented in the four living creatures; two kinds are missing. Fish and creeping things are not represented. The creeping things represent demons and the dragon, and fish represent the unsaved. In the new heaven and new earth there will be no sea, so the creatures of the sea are not represented in this scene of worship. The creeping things are headed by the dragon and, of course, are not included in this worship. God does not need creeping things and fish to worship Him.</p><p>On the veil of the temple, which represents the body of Christ, the four living creatures&mdash;the lion, the bird, the calf, and the man&mdash;are embroidered. When the veil was split, everything on it was also rent. By the death of Christ all of creation is redeemed. In His body He redeemed all creation.</p><p>The worship in Revelation 4 did not begin when John saw it. God has had this worship from before the foundation of the world. On the earth it is possible to have sin and the work of the devil; the earth is the sphere of the devil's activity now. Eventually, the sea will be his sphere. All that transpires on the earth, however, does not move the throne. On the earth men can worship lions, birds, and calves, but in heaven only God is worshipped.</p><p>God rests on His throne and that is the place of our rest too. Men of the world say, "Where is your God?" He is on His throne receiving worship. Revelation 4 is a picture of eternity. In Revelation 5 time enters in. John saw the Lamb come. Who can obtain for God what He wants? Only the Lamb can restore what God is after. God's throne is from eternity to eternity in the heavens.</p><p>In Revelation 5 we see a throne. Around the throne there are representatives of the physical and spiritual creation, and in the midst of it the Lamb comes upon the scene. Philippians 2 is the Lamb in time. Revelation 5 is the Lamb's return to heaven. In Revelation 4 we see that because of creation God receives worship. In Revelation 5 we see that because of redemption God receives worship. Revelation 5 is the coronation of the Lord.</p><p>The rest of Revelation deals mainly with the three and a half years of the tribulation. Revelation 6&mdash;19 deals with the tribulation. It speaks of the tribulation because it is the last war; it is the end of the war between God and Satan. Satan wants the great tribulation so that He will receive worship through the beast, the dragon, and the image. Satan is not ignorant of the events of Revelation 13 through 19. He works up to this for the sake of worship. He risks the lake of fire and the bottomless pit for the sake of worship. At the present time, he does not receive direct worship through idols, but during the tribulation men will worship the dragon. There will be direct worship.</p><p>Revelation 13:8 says, "All those dwelling on the earth will worship him." Satan will receive universal worship. Verse 12 tells us that he will make the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast. Many say that they do not worship anything now, but then all will worship the beast. The devil has a spirit, and by it he will move men to worship him. Verses 14 and 15 speak of the worshipping of the image of the beast, the false Christ, which is Satan himself.</p><p>In chapter fourteen three angels from heaven declare God's will. In verse 6 the eternal gospel is proclaimed. Verse 7 tells us that this gospel is to fear God and worship Him. God also stops men from worshipping His enemy. In verse 8 the second angel proclaims the fall of Babylon, and in verses 9 and 10 the third angel proclaims God's wrath upon those who have worshipped the beast. In chapter fourteen God makes a dis- tinction between two kinds of men, according to whether or not they have worshipped Satan.</p><p>Chapter fifteen speaks of the victory over the beast and the song of the Lamb (vv. 2-4). Salvation is the human portion and worship is the divine portion of the spoils of victory. By then "all the nations will come and worship before You" (v. 4).</p><p>In chapter sixteen there is a picture of the unsaved. In verses 1 and 2 we see God's judgment upon the worshippers of the beast. In verses 9 and 11 men still have not repented, and in verse 21 they blaspheme God.</p><p>Chronologically, chapter nineteen follows chapter sixteen. In verse 4 we see the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures worshipping God again. In verse 5 His slaves are praising Him. There is no mention of salvation in verse 6 because it is improper to mention salvation in such a praise. Verse 20 tells us that all those who have worshipped the image are cast alive into the lake of fire.</p><p>Revelation 20:4 speaks of those who did not worship the beast or his image; they reigned with Christ a thousand years. Whether or not these ones enter the kingdom depends on whether they have worshipped Satan.</p><p>Revelation 21:1-3 speaks of His people, which relates to God's position, His Godhead. Verses 4 through 7 say that God will be God to these ones and they shall be his sons. In order to know Him as God, we must know Him as Father, but the highest knowledge of God is not of His Fatherhood but of His Godhead. Verse 7 says, "He who overcomes will inherit these things." This overcoming is the overcoming spoken of in 1 John.</p><p>Revelation 22:8-9 contain the last reference to worship. When John saw all these wonderful things, he fell down to worship the angel. The tendency to worship something other than God is always in us. "Worship God" is the last command in the Scripture. Genuine worship is acknowledging our limitations and acknowledging that God has no limitations. We must bow before Him; He is beyond us in everything.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
