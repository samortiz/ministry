I have taken verses from various places in the Bible. Some may wonder what these verses are all about. In particular, I want to draw your attention to Hosea 7:8, which says that "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned." Brothers, in God's eyes, there are always two sides to whatever we do. A bird can only fly with two wings. Even a blade of grass has to have two sides before it can be complete. Likewise, a door has to have two sides. In this universe, everything is balanced. What is true in the physical realm is also true in the spiritual realm; everything should be balanced between two sides.</P><P>Hosea 7:8 says, "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned." What is an unturned cake? Although many of us have not made cakes before, we all have eaten cakes. Even if we do not know how cakes are baked, we have at least seen others cooking bean curd or frying vegetables. If a person only cooks one side without turning it over, the result will surely be that one side is raw, and the other side is overcooked. One side will have too little heat, while the other side will have too much heat. Anyone who cooks vegetables or bean curd knows that the same amount of heat has to be applied to both sides. If one keeps cooking only one side, the result will be that one side is burnt and the other side is uncooked. Anything burnt cannot be considered proper food; it cannot feed others. Today I will not expound on Ephraim becoming an unturned cake through mixing himself with the Gentiles. I will only draw attention to the phrase "a cake not turned." This is a principle from God for our living. If a person pays too much attention to anything, he becomes a cake not turned. One can, of course, cook one side by exposing it to fire. But if he does not turn it to the other side, the whole piece will not be well-cooked and will become useless. The most important thing for a Christian to do is to be balanced. We will pick out some examples to see how a Christian who over-emphasizes one aspect of things will become a cake not turned.</P><P>Many Christians are living a life of an unturned cake. Many emphasize personal spiritual living and neglect the corporate life. This is an unturned cake. Some pay much attention to the corporate life but forget about the individual life. Such people are also unturned cakes. Some pay too much attention to righteousness and have no grace at all. Such people are unturned cakes. It is right to be righteous. But paying attention to righteousness all the time without taking care of grace is being an unturned cake. Some people are nice; they are good to others. But they do not have any principle of righteousness. They do not want to deal with others. They pay too much attention to grace and no attention to righteousness. This also is an unturned cake. Some people pay most of their attention to the objective truths and forget the work of the Holy Spirit within man. These people are also unturned cakes. Some people pay too much attention to the subjective truths and do not pay much attention to the accomplishments of Christ on the cross. They also are unturned cakes. We can say much more about what an unturned cake is. But because of time, I will only mention these few cases.</P><P>No truth should be over-emphasized. There is always the need of balance, and there is always the need to pay attention to both sides. With the Bible, we should be aware of two things. The first is fact, and the second is principle. A fact requires us to believe in it, while a principle requires us to obey it. Many people pay attention only to the facts and not to the principles. These persons are unturned cakes, being burnt on one side. Other people only pay attention to the principles and speak much about obedience, but they do not pay attention to the accomplished facts of Christ. These people are also unturned cakes, being burnt on the other side. Such an over-emphasis of one side will cause a Christian to have a distorted living and not bring him to perfection.</P><P>Today I will draw your attention to the matter of being a Christian in four aspects. We should not be an unturned cake. I cannot enumerate all the examples of unturned cakes. I can only mention a few of them. Now I will speak on being a four-sided Christian. On the one hand, we will consider the Lord's commands. On the other hand, we will consider Paul's pattern. The Gospels show us the Lord's commands, while Paul's Epistles show us his experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S COMMANDS</H2><P>First, the Lord commands His disciples to know. He says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (Matt. 13:9). Again He says, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old" (v. 52). This refers to knowledge. If a believer is not an unturned cake, he will surely advance in knowledge.</P><P>Second, one should have faith because the Lord says, "Have faith in God." This is the original meaning of Mark 11:22.</P><P>Third, the Lord says, "Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest" (Matt. 9:38). This refers to zeal. We should be zealous for the gospel.</P><P>Fourth, the Lord says, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). This refers to life and in particular to love. We may not be as perfect as the heavenly Father is in other aspects. But at least we should pursue to be as perfect as our heavenly Father is in love. The Lord once passed through Samaria, and the people there would not receive Him. When James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" (Luke 9:54). The Lord turned and rebuked the two disciples, saying, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (v. 55). Oh, we should know of what kind of spirit we are.</P><P>We have not divided these subjects randomly. If we read the Gospels carefully and group the Lord's commands together, they are of these four categories. The Lord turns our attention to either faith, zeal, knowledge, or life. It is always one of these four things.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
