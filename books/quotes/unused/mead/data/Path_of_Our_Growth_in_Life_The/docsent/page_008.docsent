   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR ATTITUDE IN READING THE BIBLE Having the Right Feeling That We Are Coming before God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have such a realization concerning reading the Bible, we have to pay attention to our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am afraid that some brothers and sisters still do not have a thorough understanding concerning what our attitude should be in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A brother once told me of an experiment that he conducted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He placed both a chemistry book and a Bible on his desk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He then spent an hour reading the chemistry book and a second hour reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the end he discovered that according to his inner sense there was a world of difference between these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I heard this, I felt that even such a realization was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we could ask the Chinese educator and philosopher, Mr. Hu Shih, about his feeling regarding studying a book on human history versus studying the Bible, he would say that he did not have any particular feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He would say that the two books are similar and are both written with Chinese characters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book on human history has the word heaven, and the Bible also has the word heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The history book contains the word earth, and the Bible also contains such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The history book speaks of human history, and the Bible speaks of human history as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He would conclude that these two books are both literary books.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This would most likely be the feeling of Hu Shih, and it represents the feeling of non-Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose that today a child of God had a secular book in one hand and the Bible in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What would be his sense after having read these two books?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a normal condition, when God's children come to the Word of God, they should have the feeling that they have touched God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we study chemistry, we touch chemistry; when we study human history, we touch human history.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when we read the Bible, we should touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, I hope that all of us who pursue God would learn this lesson every time we read the Bible, we should touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, this morning someone came to me and told me many things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he was finished, I had not only heard his words, but I also had touched his person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person speaks to us, we not only hear his words but also touch his person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many among us who have been saved for years and have read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, when we read the Bible, do we touch only the words of the Bible, or do we touch the speaking God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This may be likened to what happens when a person tells us something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do we have a sense only of his words or of the person who is speaking the words as well?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Usually we not only touch the person's words, but we touch also the one who speaks the words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we definitely hear their speaking, the one who is speaking is also expressed in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When his words come forth, his person also comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His word may not give us a very deep impression, but his person should.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, when we read the Bible, we should have the sense that we are touching our lovely Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, every time we read the Bible, we have to exercise to meet God and to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Take myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time I read the Bible, as long as I contact the word of God, I sense that I have contacted God once again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For instance, even though I may be listening to a certain brother's voice as he is speaking into a microphone, I can still get some impression of that brother and sense his particular flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time we come to the Bible, we should also sense God's "flavor."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should sense that we have come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who sense that they have touched God when they come to the Bible seldom come to the Bible as if it were a school textbook, thinking that studying the Bible is similar to studying chemistry or mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must see that as the word of God, the Bible is God Himself coming forth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we touch the word of God, we touch God.</S>
