<h1 class="title">Satisfied with Christ Mutually<br />
in the Churches</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:12-14, 16-17; 2:2-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>A feast as the expression of the initial result of the mutual gain and enjoyment of Christ and His lover in the churches&mdash;1:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the King is feasting with His lover at the table.</li>
	<li>The love of His lover toward Him as spikenard spreads forth its fragrance.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The lover&rsquo;s gain of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A bundle of myrrh, signifying Christ&rsquo;s sweet death for her&mdash;1:13a.</li>
	<li>A cluster of henna flowers, signifying Christ in His resurrection in the churches built upon the fountain of His redemption&mdash;1:14.</li>
	<li>The husband, implied in &quot;couch&quot;&mdash;bed&mdash;1:16-17.</li>
	<li>An apple tree, rich in fruit and shade&mdash;2:3.</li>
	<li>Raisin cakes for nourishment&mdash;2:5a.</li>
	<li>Apples for supply of life&mdash;2:5b.</li>
	<li>Both raisin cakes and apples are for the healing of her sickness of love in longing after her Beloved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ&rsquo;s gain of His lover:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A companion in love&mdash;1:12.</li>
	<li>The wife&mdash;2:6.</li>
	<li>A lily, signifying one who lives by His life in trusting in God&mdash;2:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The lover&rsquo;s enjoyment of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As a bundle of myrrh between her breasts in the night&mdash;Christ in His death for her to embrace&mdash;1:13.</li>
	<li>As a cluster of henna flowers&mdash;Christ in His resurrection for her to express&mdash;1:14.</li>
	<li>As her Husband in the divine life as the couch, in Christ in His resurrection as the beams, and in Christ in His death as the rafters for their shelter&mdash;1:16-17.</li>
	<li>As an apple tree as the bountiful supply of life to her and its shade overshadowing her&mdash;2:3; 2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
	<li>As the nourishing raisin cakes&mdash;2:5a.</li>
	<li>As the refreshing apples&mdash;2:5b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ&rsquo;s enjoyment of His lover:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fragrance of His companion in love spreading forth as spikenard&mdash;1:12b.</li>
	<li>As His wife in His embracing&mdash;2:6.</li>
	<li>As a lily expressing Him in the filthy and unbelieving world&mdash;2:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Unto the mutual satisfaction and rest of Christ and His lover in the churches:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Their mutual satisfaction and rest in their mutual enjoyment of all that they are respectively.</li>
	<li>Especially their mutual satisfaction and rest in their bridal love and marriage life&mdash;1:16-17; 2:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The banqueting as the expression of the consummate result of the mutual gain and enjoyment of Christ and His lover:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the church life&mdash;the banqueting house&mdash;2:4a.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s love&mdash;banner spreads over His lover&mdash;2:4b.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s bread of life nourishes His lover and His rich supply of life refreshes her&mdash;2:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
