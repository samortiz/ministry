There were more than seventy in one table meeting. However, the point is not how many people there are, but the godliness displayed in the worship. By this we know that God is among us. I left Hsieh-Ho Hospital on July 1 of last year. I am clear that it was God's will for me to leave. After coming out, I saw all the work before me, and I jumped into it. Now I am going to homes to visit women, both believers and unbelievers. I have been to more than two hundred fifty homes and have seen the glory of God. I am useless and cannot do anything, but God Himself works everywhere. Praise and thank His holy name.</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Huang Jen-zhi</p><p>(This letter was sent from Peking to Hong Kong&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Feng-Tien</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Luan in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord for preserving us and gracing us to this day. Before we received The Open Door, the Lord had given us some light concerning how the localities should meet by themselves and how the local brothers and sisters should bear the spiritual and practical responsibilities. This is the only way to have real growth. Thank the Lord that His light shined more clearly on us when we received this issue of The Open Door. We can only rely on Him and ask Him to lead the localities into His grace. We pray constantly before Him for the believers in every place. May the Lord give grace to the brothers and sisters in every place. We thank the Lord even more because the faithfulness of the saints to the Lord has touched our hearts. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chao Fei-wo, Sang Chen-kuang<br />January 21</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X in the Lord:</p><p>I received a copy of the first and second issues of The Open Door from my brother Shi-shun. Now I know about the condition of the work in all the localities and how the brothers and sisters are doing. I am really thankful. There were meetings in Sian last winter in Brother Chao Rue-tze's house. Brother Chao was here from Tsinan at that time, and I had temporarily moved there from Tai-Yuan. In the middle of November, I returned to my ancestral home (Hwai-Yuen, Anhwei). On January 20 my brother, Shi-shun, and I returned. Brother Chao had already moved his family to Szechuan. There are no meetings now. In the deepest part of my spirit and heart, I feel that I have lost a support without the meetings; I am very depressed. If the Lord allows, I hope to bring my family so that we can rent a house and begin to meet. It is easier to meet in someone's home. The Lord is omnipotent. I really hope you and all the brothers and sisters will pray for this matter so that it will come to pass soon. Please send all subsequent issues of The Open Door, beginning with the third issue, to me. If there are extra copies of the first and second issues, please send me one copy. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Jih-wu<br />February 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
