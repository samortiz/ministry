If we changed suddenly, it might result in a great loss. Thus, he proposed a brothers' meeting for the brothers and a sisters' meeting for the sisters. In these meetings he said that there should not be any assigned speaker. He made it clear that all of the saints should speak in mutuality. These meetings, however, did not succeed. Eventually, we were not able to practice the truth which Brother Nee saw in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</P><P>As our history progressed in the Lord's recovery, some situation of our meetings has gradually drifted back more to the same as that of Christianity. Even though we had renounced the traditional and unscriptural way of Christianity, we still carried with us some of Christianity's practice of meeting. Christianity is still prevailing among us as long as we continue the practice of having church meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. For the church life, the way of meeting is vital. How the church goes on depends upon how we meet. If we still meet according to the traditional way of Christianity, how can we say we have given up Christianity? We are still continuing in this unscriptural practice.</P><P>This traditional practice, the practice of the clergy and laity, results in hierarchy. We have said that we hate, despise, and condemn the clergy-laity system, but what has been the real situation among us in the past years? We have to admit that unconsciously the clergy-laity system has crept in among us. Spontaneously, hierarchy has also begun to exist among us, and the clergy-laity system has been increasing unintentionally among us. In nearly every locality, there has been one big speaker. Not much attention or regard was given to all the saints functioning in mutuality. In the meetings of the church, everyone expected to have a good speaker.</P><P>In 1984 I felt strongly that I should go back to Taiwan to have a new start for the Lord's recovery. I was clear that we needed a new start, and the way to have a new start among us was to change the system of our meetings. The new start had to be revolutionary in the sense of overthrowing the unscriptural and traditional way of meeting. I saw clearly that if we could overthrow this way of meeting, hierarchy would have no place among us. We must overthrow the way of meeting with a big congregation, and with one person speaking and the rest listening. This annuls the clergy-laity system. The proper way of meeting is a way that is full of mutuality.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
