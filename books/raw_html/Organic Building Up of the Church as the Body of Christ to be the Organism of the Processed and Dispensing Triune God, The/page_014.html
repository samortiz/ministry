 <h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In the organic Body of Christ, there are organic functions (Rom. 12:4-8). Because we are in this organic Body, we should be organic. Do all of us function organically in the church life? Instead of functioning organically in the church life, we may do things mechanically. We must function either as joints of supply or as parts operating. We must have something with which to supply others, or we should operate in our measure. We must function organically for the building up of the organic Body. When the entire Body is operating, the Body causes the growth of itself, resulting in it being built up in love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Local Expressions of the Organic Body<br />
of Christ by the Move of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The organic function of the church is in the local expressions of the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:28) and by the move of the Triune God in the operations of God, through the ministries of the Lord, and with the gifts of the Spirit in His manifestations to the members of the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:4-11). While we are functioning either as supplying joints or as operating parts, the Triune God, who is within us, moves together with us. In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, the Triune God is mentioned. There are God the Father&rsquo;s operations, God the Son&rsquo;s ministries, and God the Spirit&rsquo;s gifts. The gifts of the Spirit are to carry out the ministries of the Lord, and the ministries of the Lord are to accomplish the operations of God the Father. The Triune God does not move apart from us. He is waiting for us. When we move, He moves. When we speak, He speaks. If we do not speak in a meeting, God cannot speak. The Spirit exercises His gifts, the Lord carries out His ministries, and God operates while we are functioning. The organic function of the church by the move of the Triune God is for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of the all-inclusive One who fills all in all.</p>
