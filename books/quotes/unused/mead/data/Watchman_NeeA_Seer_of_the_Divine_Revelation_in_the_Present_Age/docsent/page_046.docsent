   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Called</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not long after this a certain Christian girls' high school offered me the position of dean.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I considered employing some methods of my own to improve the religious life in the school.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After two weeks I became sick and knew it was the Lord's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I realized that I was not right, for I was ambitious and was depending on my strength to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I began from that time to learn to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A short time later God again demanded that I leave my teaching job and serve Him with my whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I resigned in March of 1920.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, I answered the Lord's call to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After leaving my job, I worked with an American lady missionary for seven years, receiving much help and edification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Seeking the Lord's Way</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During these years I frequently contacted the various groups in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I discovered that most of them had fallen into organizations of human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I desired to seek for a straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, the Lord brought me to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There I met some spiritual brothers and sisters who helped me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I began to learn the difference between what was of man and what was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Contact with Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of 1922 Ruth Lee was invited to visit Foochow for evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers and sisters in Foochow were preparing to meet her at the pier.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The night before her arrival, Watchman Nee was considering whether or not to join the reception, thinking that although she might be a good evangelist, since she was a female, she should not be too highly esteemed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, during the night he had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that dream he and others met her at the pier.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he saw her in the dream, the Lord told him that she would be his co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next morning he awoke and seriously considered the dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He realized that if that dream was of the Lord, he would miss the Lord's will if he did not meet her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So he went.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When her boat arrived at the pier, many brothers and sisters went on board to welcome her, but Watchman Nee stayed somewhat behind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They shook hands with Sister Lee and introduced her to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "I have seen her already."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, they did not understand what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1926 Ruth Lee and Cheng Chi-kwei invited Watchman to Nanking for some rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time he had further contact with Ruth Lee and some others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In his Narration of the Past, given in a meeting in Shanghai on December 4, 1932, Watchman Nee referred to Ruth Lee's situation as follows:</S>
