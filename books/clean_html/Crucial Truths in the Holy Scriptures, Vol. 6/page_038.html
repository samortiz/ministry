<p>Now we need to consider two distinctly different matters: death and resurrection. The Bible often speaks of death and resurrection as being opposite to each other. First Corinthians 15:22 says, &ldquo;Just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.&rdquo; Just as Adam and Christ are opposites, death and resurrection are opposites. Adam gives us sin, and the result of sin is death. Christ gives us righteousness, and the result of righteousness is life, or resurrection (Rom. 5:17). These two are the exact opposites of the other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEATH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through sin, death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:12).</p>
<p>The Bible clearly tells us that death entered into the world through sin. If there were no sin in the universe, there would be no death, but since there is sin in the universe, there is death. The origin of death is sin. This chapter and the preceding chapter are related because death comes through sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:15).</p>
<p>Death is produced from sin. When sin is fully grown, it brings forth death. Thus, death comes through sin; it is the result of sin. Sin is the origin of death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Where, O death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:55-56).</p>
<p>Sin is the sting of death. Just as we use a fishhook to catch fish, death uses sin as a stinging hook to catch people. Once a person touches sin, he is hooked by death, poisoned by death&rsquo;s sting, and unable to escape death. In order to escape from death, one must escape from sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Might of Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Death reigned...even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam&rsquo;s transgression&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<p>Death has might because it can reign over man. Adam and all his descendants are under the might of death and are controlled by death. No one can escape death; death reigns over all the descendants of Adam because of his transgression. Death has the might to control us (v. 17).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Where, O death, is your victory?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:55).</p>
<p>Song of Songs 8:6 portrays death as being something exceedingly strong. Therefore, the might of death is strong; it has the ability to be victorious. According to the Bible, nothing in the universe other than the resurrection of the Lord Jesus can defeat the victorious might of death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>The devil has the might of death in his hands. He works out death in everyone through sin, and he exercises the might of death in everyone because of the presence of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Death</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, there are at least four aspects related to the suffering of death, which speak of the meaning of death.</p>
