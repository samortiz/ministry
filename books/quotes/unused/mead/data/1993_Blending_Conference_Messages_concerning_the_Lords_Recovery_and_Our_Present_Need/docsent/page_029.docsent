   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Spirit's Sealing and Pledging</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 13 and 14 are another section which shows us the blessings in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit's sealing in verse 13 is a great blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to consider why the Spirit comes to seal us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because we have become God's inheritance, and He needs to put His seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We always want to put our name on what we treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we buy a beautiful Bible, we may put our seal with our name upon it to show that it belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this sealing implies even more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ink on the seal saturates the sealed paper, so this sealing is the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 4:30 says that this sealing with the Spirit as the divine ink will last until our body is redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sealing of the Spirit with its permeating and soaking within us is still going on every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This takes place whether we obey Him or disobey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we obey Him, He seals us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not obey Him, He may seal us even more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord may impress a young person to go to a conference with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, he may go to the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the theater the Lord continues to seal him, and this sealing is a bothering within him, impressing him to leave the theater and go to the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was a young person, I played soccer a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After I was saved by the Lord, no one told me not to play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I still went to play.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But one day when I was playing, something touched me within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the ball came to me, I could not kick it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I just walked away and could no longer give myself to play soccer again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The whole team was surprised at me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the issue of the Spirit's sealing within me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can never forget that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sisters may desire to go shopping, not just to take care of their need but to satisfy their lust for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they are shopping for things on sale, the Spirit will be sealing them, impressing them to go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were regenerated, we were sealed by the Spirit, and this sealing is still going on every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This sealing eventually becomes the pledging to guarantee that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sealing is to confirm that we are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It confirms His ownership of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This sealing then becomes a pledging to guarantee, to assure us, that God will be our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The pledging is also the Spirit's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can see the three aspects of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father's nature and life have been dispensed into us; the Son's life element has been dispensed into us; and the Spirit's essence is also dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So we have the essence, the element, and the life and nature of the Triune God all the time dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The issue is that we are constituted the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are the Body of Christ because we have received the dispensing of the divine life, nature, element, and essence into our being.</S>
