<h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS WE ENCOUNTERED AND OUR SOLUTION</h2>
<p>We studied how to deal with the difficulties brought to us by those who were powerful in the gospel and were spiritual but who did not bear this testimony. We sought the Lord, asking what type of attitude we should have toward them. Indeed, there were some who were powerful in the gospel. For example, Dr. John Sung was an evangelist when we became clear concerning this testimony in 1935. He went everywhere preaching the gospel. Whether his jumping, kicking, shouting, and weeping were in the flesh or had an element of the Spirit, wherever he went, thousands of people repented when he preached. He was powerful in the gospel, but he always rebuked us. We did not know what attitude we should have toward him, and the co-workers among us considered this to be a serious problem.</p>
<p>There was also Pastor Chia, who was weighty in the truth and held a high position among theologians. Although he treasured us, he opposed us for taking this way. A distinguished theological school, the Chinese Women&rsquo;s Seminary in River Bay, Shanghai, also opposed us and forbade its students from attending our meetings in Shanghai. It was difficult for us to know what our attitude should be when we were opposed by those who were powerful in the gospel or had spiritual weight.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1934 Brother Nee and I went to River Bay by car. It was a long journey during which he expressed his feelings in our conversation. He asked me what I felt we should do since so many were against us. We could not deny that some preached the gospel with much power. We also could not deny that others were truly spiritual; they led others to love the Lord, spoke concerning the way of the cross, and edified others in the truth. However, they rejected us. We were tested in this matter and did not know what attitude we should have.</p>
<p>After much consideration, study, fellowship, and seeking of the Lord, eventually all the co-workers felt that we could not give up our testimony, and we could not leave the ground on which we stood. We could accept the gospel preached in power, and we could accept the spiritual matters, including the perfecting in truth and life, but we absolutely could not waver concerning the ground and the testimony. We could fellowship with other believers on spiritual matters, receiving and sharing spiritual things with them. We should fellowship mutually in the gospel, in spiritual matters, and in the truth, but we could not compromise the church ground. We decided that this should be our attitude.</p>
<p>We tried to receive spiritual things from others; we accepted things related to the gospel and the truth. However, this attitude gave Brother Yu Cheng-hwa the boldness to accept all the things of Madame Guyon, including some things of Catholicism. He did this because the co-workers had adopted an attitude of receiving anything related to the gospel, spirituality, or the truth that a person had, regardless of their denomination or sect, without sacrificing our ground.</p>
<p>In the co-workers&rsquo; meeting held in Shanghai in 1937, we fellowshipped concerning the line of Antioch. Brother Nee then suggested that we proceed in two ways. On one hand, we would all go to different places and establish meetings in order to propagate; on the other hand, those of us who were clear concerning the truth would try to labor in the denominations, releasing the truth and giving them a spiritual supply. After this fellowship we began to carry out the work in these aspects.</p>
<p>Shortly after that fellowship, however, the war with Japan began. This caused the propagation work to stop. At that time, there were many intellectuals among us; many brothers and sisters were working in the medical or educational fields. During the war, many of them moved to provinces that were farther from the war front, and they evacuated from places that were occupied by the Japanese, such as Nanking. It was not until the end of the war that we again began to meet in these places. During the war, Satan was working and dealt Brother Nee a heavy blow. As a result, those who moved away from the war did not receive much supply, and the believers in territories occupied by the enemy were weak. Thus, the testimony was weakened in all the places.</p>
<p>In this weakened condition we saw that those in the denominations were more effective in the gospel, they were the same as us in spirituality, and they had produced ones who understood the truth. It seemed as if leaving the denominations was our only accomplishment. Our situation was gloomy and dismal. After the war the leading ones experienced great difficulties with one another because they had gone through a long period of being neglected, tried, and frustrated. The churches suffered various trials. When the saints returned to Shanghai, all the co-workers gathered together and fellowshipped. Based on our feeling and our past experiences, we decided that we must keep the testimony that we saw in the beginning, the testimony of one local church in one locality and that we must build all spiritual things on this ground. We would accept things of the gospel, spirituality, and the truth from other denominations or sects. The only thing we would not relinquish and would insist upon was the ground of the church. We would insist on taking the ground of one locality for one church; we would hold on to the testimony of the Body of Christ.</p>
