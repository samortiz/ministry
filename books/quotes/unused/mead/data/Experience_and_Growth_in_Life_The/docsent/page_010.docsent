   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING CHRIST BY TAKING OUR SPIRIT AS OUR PERSON WITH THE SOUL AS ITS ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament reveals that we have an old man Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22 and that we are a new man 2 Cor 5:17; Col 3:10-11; Eph 4:24; 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we were saved, we were an old man without the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after we were saved, we became a new man with an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we were saved, our soul was our person, and our spirit was merely an organ for us to contact and receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when we were saved, receiving Christ as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit, our spirit became our new person, a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This new man is our regenerated spirit with Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, as its life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit has become our new person, and the soul has become an organ to serve our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through regeneration our spirit received the divine life, making it a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, our new man is the spirit, and our soul has become the organ of this new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our soul serves our spirit by its ability to think, understand, interpret, decide, love, or hate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of these abilities are for the spirit's use, to serve the spirit's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our soul has been rejected as the person, but our soul is still useful as an organ for our new man, the regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to live Christ, to live because of Christ, we must learn to deny our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The truth of denying the soul has been opposed by some.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have said that if we deny our soul, we will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To deny our soul, however, means to deny the soul as our person, but not as our organ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As an organ, our soul our mind, emotion, and will is very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In spiritual experience, the more spiritual we are, the more thoughtful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more spiritual we are, the more emotional we are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, if we do not know how to weep or shed tears, we are not very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we need to consider how we shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we shed tears from our soul as our person, this is not to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For many years I never shed tears from my soul as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when I began to live in the spirit, in my new man, taking the soul as my organ, I began to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At these times I shed tears by the soul as my organ, not as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The person who shed tears was my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the same principle today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we love someone by our soul as a person, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be love, but it is of the old man and is still related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To love by our soul as our person is wrong, but to love by our spirit as our person with our soul as our organ is right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible to love someone without our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit, strictly speaking, does not have the loving ability.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to love, we must have a loving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The loving organ is our emotion, a part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit by itself cannot weep or shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus wept John 11:35; Luke 19:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wept from His spirit as His person with His soul as His organ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not love by the soul as His person; rather, He loved by His spirit as His person with His soul as His organ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, as Christians, we are the same as the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our Christian life, our soul must be denied as our person, yet our soul is still very useful as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When our soul rises up to be our person, we should tell our soul: "Dear soul, you were my person in the past, but not today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, you are my organ in resurrection, and my person is my regenerated spirit with the Lord Jesus as its life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This spirit is the new man, and this new man is my person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You, dear soul, are now only my organ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Stay in your position, and do not propose anything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I love or think, you must be my loving and thinking organ."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In my personal time with the Lord, my confession has most often been about living from the soul as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Very often I forgot that the soul was not my person, and I listened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My soul told me to love, so I loved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I lived the old man, not in doing bad things, but in doing good things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To merely do good things is not to live Christ; it is not something of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Both good things and bad things are of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only when we live Christ in our spirit are we living the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must ask ourselves each day whether we have lived Christ or whether we have just behaved properly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many times I have confessed to the Lord, saying: "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I still have not succeeded in living You.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I lived You perhaps only one fourth of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But the rest of the day, I lived the old man by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul could say, To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,' but I cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Lord, forgive me."</S>
