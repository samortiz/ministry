   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Have Regulations</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>without Legality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to learn to do everything in the Lord s service without legality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This, however, does not mean that we do not have regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not right for a brother who lives in the brothers house to come home at two o clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a need to set up rules for their daily living, such as what time the door is locked and what time the lights are turned off.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is appropriate to set up the kind of rules that help others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we should change our attitude concerning forcing others to call on the Lord s name or to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not even appropriate to force the saints in a meeting to call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Calling on the name of the Lord has indeed helped us, and pray-reading the Word has nourished us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Calling on the Lord s name or pray-reading His Word is not a problem, and it is not necessarily true that those who pray-read the Word are more spiritual than those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not to say that we should not pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Taking vitamins is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who take vitamins are not necessarily healthier than those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is an erroneous attitude to say that if this is the case, we will not take any vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others may not need to take vitamins to remain healthy, but we may become sick and even die if we do not take vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some might continue to live without pray-reading the Lord s Word, but we become dry and even wither if we do not pray-read the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though we are nourished by pray-reading the Lord s Word, we should not require that others pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though we are supplied by pray-reading the Lord s Word, we cannot say that we are stronger than others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not Requiring Uniformity</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very easy to require uniformity in the brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only so, it is even easy for the elders to require uniformity in a church of only fifty to sixty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders may expect all the saints in their locality to be as orderly as a gymnastic class so that a visitor would see them pray-reading the Word and calling on the Lord s name in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the worst possible thing we can do is to turn a church into a gymnastic team or a military platoon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would you prefer the church to be a home or a military platoon?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all want the church to be a home that can care for the young and the sick and can feed and give people warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The feeding and support in a home are lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If, instead, there is drill practice every day, the young and the sick would not live longer than six months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, there is no need to require uniformity in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being Flexible in Our Practice</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should be flexible and not rigid in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only should the brothers and sisters houses be managed in this way, but the church should also be led in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brothers and sisters houses render much help to the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There must be wisdom and love in leading the young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to lead them gradually and in wisdom through their weaknesses, and render them proper care.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to give them the feeling that we are not regulating, restricting, or limiting them; rather, we are sympathetic and considerate, and we think of them for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we regulate others to do this or that, the result will not be good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, those who have lived in the brothers or sisters house for a longer time should be like older brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should be supportive and warm toward the younger saints who may still have some bad habits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The younger saints should know that the more experienced ones are willing to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all the same, and our spirit has been enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we can cultivate the young ones in this way, in two to three weeks they will be delivered from their old habits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be rigid when we help them, nor should we be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should learn the best way to use the brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>NEEDING A STUDENT CENTER IN TAIPEI</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to our observation, there is also the need of a student center in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hall three will be renovated, and we feel that it should be made into a student center because it is situated near several universities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our plan is to have a building with six stories above ground and seven stories underground.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We would like to be able to house as many people as possible, at least three hundred students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The student center will be larger than a brothers or sisters house, and we believe that it will be twice as effective as corporate housing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The student center will need careful planning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There needs to be space designated for activities and lounges, and at least two or three floors should be used as bedrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In addition, there is a need to learn how to manage and take care of such a place so that it meets the needs of the students and can reap a harvest.</S>
