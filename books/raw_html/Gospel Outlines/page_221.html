 <h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirty-eight</h2>
<h1 class="title">JESUS BEARING SIN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:5-6, 12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The purpose of His becoming a man was to bear the sins of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>His death on the cross was for the redemption of man from sins.</li>
	<li>His blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How can He bear the sins of those who are not yet born?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although man is limited by time, God is not under the same limitation. For example, some people make preparations for their descendants even before the latter are born. Consider how the railway was laid long before you were born. When you want to travel by train, you do not have to ask that the tracks be laid again.</li>
	<li>God is not limited by time because He is eternal. Look at the circle in the figure. Where is the beginning and where is the end? As in a circle there is neither beginning nor ending, so also in God&rsquo;s provision the cross is timeless, taking care of your sins before they were even committed in time.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>How can the blood of Jesus cleanse our sins?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is not the physical applying of some blood on your body that cleanses you.</li>
	<li>His blood is a symbol. It is a symbol of God&rsquo;s righteous demand being fulfilled.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirty-nine</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Cor. 15:36-38; John 12:24; Acts 2:32; 3:15; 5:30; 1 Cor. 15:14,17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jesus resurrected from the dead
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not only spiritually, but also physically and psychologically.</li>
	<li>His tomb was empty.</li>
	<li>After His resurrection, He asked His disciples to touch His side, proving that He was risen physically.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His resurrection He is the divine life-seed<br />
<span class="normal">If a seed with life concealed within it can sprout after being buried in the ground, how much more can Jesus, being God, with the divine life inside Him, sprout forth again to bear fruit.</span></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s saving power proves His resurrection
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Give examples and tell stories of the present and real saving power of the Lord Jesus.</li>
	<li>The gospel of the Lord is a gospel of power.</li>
	<li>Power proves that He is living.</li>
	<li>All the founders of the different religions lay dead in their tombs&mdash;only Jesus resurrected.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The power of answered prayer proves the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Today whenever a man calls on the name of the Lord, his prayer is answered.</li>
	<li>This experience of prayer being answered is a proof of the resurrection of Jesus.</li>
	</ol></li>
