   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO MORE INDIVIDUALS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One thing we must realize is that when God gets into us, we eventually become no more individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is just like the electric light fixtures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the electricity flows into them, they are all individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But once the electricity comes, all the light fixtures become one with the electricity, and the electricity becomes their unity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the fixtures are brought into a kind of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, Christians should not be individual units.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should have something of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our unity is the very God who is our content within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God is our content, we are not just so many different individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Outwardly speaking we are, but inwardly speaking we are one unity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose there are thirty light fixtures on the ceiling with the electric current flowing through them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outwardly, they are many individual lights, but inwardly there is only one electricity, through which they become one unity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They all have one content, and that content is their unity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are many Christians, but we all have one content; so we all have the same unity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God Himself within us is our content.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the deepest relation that God has with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CORPORATE EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The outcome of this is that God has a corporate expression, for He has become one with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the relation the Bible reveals between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many other items in the Bible, but they are not so deep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is not only our Creator, our Father, our Lord, and so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The deepest aspect of God s relation with us is that He comes into us to be our content in order that we might become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, He becomes our content that He may become us, and we may become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a great, universal undertaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a heavenly, divine, eternal, and holy project.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is working Himself into us to be one with us that He might be our content, and that we might be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To accomplish this universal, divine project, God has to take seven steps.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are only going to cover one of these during these messages, but we need to look at all seven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first step is incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not mention the matter of creation, because that is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first main step that God took to accomplish His divine project is incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Incarnation far transcends creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In creation, God merely made so many things the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That was indeed marvelous, but that was not so wonderful as the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In creation, God never came into the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The incarnation, however, is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God took the first step to become incarnated by coming into man and being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Incarnation means that God becomes one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all know from the Gospels that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was just a little child born of a virgin, called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this little child is called Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He who was named Jesus was God, God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Jewish people today do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They even have the Old Testament which says in Isaiah 7:14, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel, yet they do not believe that the child born in a manger at Bethlehem was Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matthew 1:23 says the same thing: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In that manger was a little child who was the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God and man were made one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Though He was a child, yet His name was called Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This corresponds with Isaiah 9:6, which says, Unto us a child is born...his name is called The Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was God, but He was not merely God; He was God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before incarnation, God was so great.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was in the heavens, and He was so free.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But by incarnation, He became very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was limited in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had to escape from the land of Canaan to Egypt, and come back from Egypt to the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then He went to the North, to a little city called Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, He became a Nazarene, a little man in the city of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we must realize that this was God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The incarnation was the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was the Word become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us John 1:1, 14a .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was the first step.</S>
