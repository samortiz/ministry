   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURNING OF THE SEVEN SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIRECTING THE WORLD SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ and the Spirit are revealed in Revelation to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, this carrying out of God s economy involves administrating the entire situation in this universe and mainly administrating the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the international affairs are neither in the hands of the diplomats nor in the hands of the United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The deciding place is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything in today s situation is decided on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By my reading and studying of the world situation over the past sixty years, I fully realize that the throne of God in the heavens is the deciding factor of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Neither Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, nor any of the world governments were the deciding factors of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They all failed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The deciding factor is the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of the world leaders are under the flaming of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seven Spirits are burning on this earth today for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ carries out His mission as the Ruler of the kings of the earth by the seven burning Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must realize that today the seven Spirits of God are burning not only concerning the churches but also concerning the world situation for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire world situation is under the flame of the burning of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seven Spirits today are carrying out God s administration on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The world situation, the international affairs, are all under the direction of this flame.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have seen the flame of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God sovereignly controlling the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Hitler took over Belgium in World War II, it would have been possible for him to go straight into England.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>England was unprepared to face that situation and was ready to be taken over by Hitler, but Hitler made the decision to turn to attack Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The flame of the seven Spirits turned him away from England at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>History tells us that this was a great mistake made by Hitler, and this was under the sovereign control of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Bringing Forth the Golden Lampstands</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The purpose of the burning flame in carrying out God s economy is to bring forth the golden lampstands, the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Burning implies judging, purifying, refining, and producing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never be disappointed by the rottenness, corruption, and immorality of today s human society.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be disappointed or so concerned for the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, do not be disappointed by the weakness of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not believe in the seemingly disappointing condition in the world or in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe in the flame of the burning seven Spirits which control and direct the world and which also judge, purify, and refine the church to produce a pure golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are here endeavoring to afford the Lord a chance and an entrance to judge us, purify us, and refine us to produce a pure golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are open wide to the flaming of the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to pray, Dear divine Flame, come!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Come and judge!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Come and purify!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Come and refine that You may produce the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nearly all the doors are closed to Christ in today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By His mercy, though, we are open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every day, every morning, and every evening, we need to pray, Lord, come; we are open to You!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We open every avenue of our being to You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not know how much you pray or how you pray, but I can testify that nearly every day I pray, Lord, enlighten me; search me within and expose me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I like to be enlightened by You and exposed in Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you like this or do you shut yourself up and hide something from Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to pray, Lord, we are open.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Come and shine upon us and shine from within us and enlighten every avenue and every corner of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I like to be exposed, purged, and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the Lord has a way to produce a pure golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The burning is going on not only in the entire world situation, but also in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more I read the newspapers, the more I get confirmed that the flaming Spirits direct the world situation, and also this flaming purifies the church to produce the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The seven Spirits, who are out from the eternal One and of the redeeming One, are the seven lamps of fire burning before God s throne, executing God s economy in the universe, and the seven eyes of the slain Lamb, searching and infusing the churches 4:5; 5:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The twofold mission of the seven Spirits is to carry out God s administration and to search and infuse the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The seven Spirits search out our sinfulness and infuse us with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While a person is speaking to you, his two eyes are also infusing you with his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In like manner, the seven Spirits of God as the eyes of the Lamb infuse us with this wonderful One s burden and essence.</S>
