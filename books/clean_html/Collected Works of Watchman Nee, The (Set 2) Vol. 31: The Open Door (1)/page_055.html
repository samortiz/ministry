<h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>I had just returned from the meeting place when I received your letter. Thank God, and thank you. I already have the second issue of The Open Door. I hope to receive the third issue soon.</p><p>Having been assured of God's leading and arrangement, I accepted the invitation of the brothers and sisters of the assembly in Han-Jiang and arrived on the fifteenth with Sister Weigh Kwang-ying. We began a sisters' conference on the seventeenth, which will tentatively last for a week. Four days of the conference have already passed. Every day there is a prayer meeting from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. At 10:00 a.m. there is an edification meeting in which we discuss matters of the spiritual life. There is a meeting which starts at 2:00 p.m. to discuss questions related to the sisters' daily living. May the Lord bear the responsibility to work, oversee, bless, correct, and accomplish everything! I hope you can teach me many things. After the conference I will probably have two or three days to contact the sisters individually and talk with them. Because it is the traditional time of the New Year, I want to take this opportunity to pray for a few days with a few sisters who have already been called out, if the Lord is willing. If the Lord delays and keeps me away from home, I will wait for a clearer leading and then go to Sien-You and Feng-Ting to work, because the brothers and sisters there have invited me. Please pray for me. In the future my travels will be more from assembly to assembly; therefore, they will not be too strenuous. I will serve God mainly among the sisters and will have many companions; you do not need to worry about me. There are still two days of the conference left. There are many sisters who have come from the neighboring localities to attend the conference. I am sincerely waiting before God, hoping that He will work beyond our capacity and not be limited in His work by a narrow vessel. May He gain the sisters, and may they boldly dive in and get to know Him. Please greet Mrs. Yuan and the sisters who are with you! Brother Ke-san will go to Amoy and Kulangsu. Brother Tsai-seng has already returned. May we meet before the Lord soon. Peace and health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Hsu-min<br />January 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Greetings in love to Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>I received and read your letter. You will soon go to Kuei-yang, which is a new place to you. I hope you will take care of yourself for the Lord's sake. When you have time, please write to instruct me so that I may be comforted. I am busy as usual. There is nothing much to tell you. However, the Lord's love and His marvelous leading are too great to be recounted. Praise the Lord! After returning to Fukien, my spiritual condition has been up and down for four months. Although I have no help but the Lord, He has promised, "I will not fail you or forsake you." Hallelujah! It is enough to have the Lord! The Lord opened the way for me this time to temporarily leave Jien-Ou. I passed through two places where I stayed for a few days testifying for the Lord. I finally came here to Chung-An. There is a sister who cares for the souls of her relatives and those in the countryside, and she asked for a special leave of absence from the administrators at the hospital to make the long journey for the sole purpose of paying back the gospel debt. I met her in Jien-Yang (one hundred and twenty miles from Jien-Ou). Although we had never met before, we felt like we were old friends. She asked me to come with her on this trip so that she might have my help in the joyful task of testifying to her relatives and family. As a consequence, I had her as a guide to take me to another county and city to testify. Because it was the end of the old year and the beginning of the new and because each household was very superstitious and busy, we did not have as many opportunities as we had in the other localities I passed through. However, the gospel was preached and all who were predestined to obtain eternal life believed. Chung-An borders Kiangsu province. It is near Wu-Yi-Yan. The scenery is outstanding, and they produce excellent tea here. A new road is being built that will connect this area with Kiangsu province. I hope that when communication is more convenient in the future, many who travel for the Lord will come to the northern region of Fukien so that many will understand salvation and enter into the Lord's name. I have not received the second issue of The Open Door. I think the postal service must have lost it. If you have any news of Sister Tso, please tell me. Sister Juang Shi-chi and Sister Lee Ju-lien left the coastal area four or five months ago and went northwest to Shao-Wu. Their goal is to testify for the Lord in their jobs. Sister Juang sent me a letter a few days ago asking about your recent condition. I have already told her. This letter is too short to hold all that I want to say, and I would have to go on and on. Peace to you! Peace to Sisters Wang and Chang. My two sons are still at boarding school. They have received the Lord's grace and are healthy. Their studies are improving. I know you care about them, so I am giving you their news.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu-bing<br />February 3<br />[Address omitted]</p>
