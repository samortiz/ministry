In the Gospel of Matthew the kingdom of God is called 'the kingdom of the heavens'; elsewhere it is called the 'heavenly kingdom'
When it does mention the kingdom of God, it mentions only the name without explaining what the kingdom of God actually is
For this reason many people know the kingdom of God in name but not in its reality-they do not know what the kingdom of God truly is
Today when many people preach the gospel, they preach the 'heavenly mansion' as the central and most important matter
Gods intention with the gospel is not to save people into heaven but to save them into the kingdom that is into the kingdom of the heavens
Revelation 21:2 says, 'I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
You may also know that through the gospel of God you have received God's life to become God's child and a member of God's household
Perhaps you know that through the gospel of God you have received the Holy Spirit of God and all kinds of spiritual gifts and blessings
In the New Testament age the age of the gospel the first sentence God spoke to man was Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
When the Lord Jesus came out to preach, His first sentence was also 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
It not only causes people to be forgiven of their sins, receive life, be saved, and be regenerated, but it also brings them into a kingdom
He says, 'Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him'?
He says In this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you
He indicates that regeneration is for the kingdom of God, writing that unless one is born anew, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
Halfway through the book he said, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ'
At the end he said that all the overcomers will be resurrected and will reign with Christ for a thousand years
The Bible repeatedly reveals that the central, primary, and most important goal of the gospel of God is the kingdom of God
We must receive the life of this kingdom in order to live in this kingdom and to live the life that corresponds to this kingdom
In summary the goal of the gospel of God is the kingdom of God that is to save people into this kingdom that they may live in this kingdom
All the riches of salvation given to us by God are for one thing-to bring us into His kingdom that we may live in this kingdom
We must see that neither the forgiveness of sins nor life is the goal of the gospel of God; the goal of the gospel of God is the kingdom
We probably have seen the forgiveness of sins, life, and various gifts and blessings, but we may not have seen the kingdom
Those who know God realize that all spiritual matters were revealed in the Gospels and the Epistles in the age of the apostles
If we carefully study church history in the last five hundred years, we will clearly see the steps of God's recovery
Some time later He recovered the truth of the cross as the way to solve all the problems in the universe and accomplish all God's work
At that point the truths of justification by faith, Christ as our life, and the cross accomplishing God's work were almost fully recovered
Christ accomplished the work of the cross, the cross produced the church, and the church brought in the kingdom
In the full manifestation of the kingdom the will of God will have been done in the universe and His name will have been sanctified on earth
Now we have clearly seen that the New Testament comprises four great matters: Christ, the cross, the church, and the kingdom
Concerning the truths of the church and the kingdom, until today many of God's children still do not have an adequate understanding
God's children know these two things merely as terms but lack an adequate understanding of what they actually are
After His resurrection the Lord Jesus spent forty days speaking to His disciples the things concerning the kingdom of God
What the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the kingdom of God in those forty days is not clearly stated in the Bible
Usually the things God wants us to know are clearly revealed in the Bible but sometimes it seems that God wants to give us a difficult time
In the beginning of the New Testament the Lord Jesus proclaimed the gospel by saying Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near
Later, when He was teaching the disciples, He began by saying, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If the Philippines were not a country but merely a deserted island, it would be an ordinary place where people could freely enter and leave
Even after permission is obtained, we still cannot act freely but must be under the restriction of the law of the government there
It is because the Philippines is a country, not a vacant land or a deserted island, nor merely a place or a space
Before we repented, believed in the Lord, and were saved, we did not have God's authority in us and were therefore not under God's ruling
In these past six thousand years there has not been the authority of God, the kingdom of God, in millions of Adam's descendants on earth
Before we were saved, we knew only the laws of the nation, the rules in our family, and the regulations of the school
The gospel in the New Testament begins with the words, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
In Luke 17:20-21 the Lord Jesus said, 'The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is!
A naughty one may occupy twothirds of one side when he sits down as a result when a younger brother comes he is forced to sit at the corner
He should occupy only half of one side of the table, but he takes up more than half and occupies the space of another
Sometimes when we come to a meeting, we are unrighteous in the way we sit by taking up extra space, thus forcing others to sit uncomfortably
At other times, although we may do it unintentionally, we take home the Bibles and hymnals that are available for public use
After this person sat down, he stepped on the dress of the lady sitting in front of him, causing some damage to the dress
When he came in he sat down loosely and carelessly stepped on someones dress damaging it but then he pretended that nothing had happened
Even when we come to the Lords table meeting and break the bread together we still may not speak because we have no peace with one another
If the kingdom of God is ruling us within and has ground in us, we will have peace in our dealings with others
If you allow God to rule in you, your dealings with others will be peaceful and harmonious, and you will not quarrel with anyone
If you allow God to rule in you and have ground in you, you will be joyful in your spirit and in the Holy Spirit
Like the children of Israel in the age of the judges, who had no king among them , today's Christians have no kingdom among them
In other words, there is no authority or restraint among them; each one does things according to his or her own will
One who is ruled by God and submits to God's authority can be joyful even in his sufferings and difficult situations
Essentially, He was saying to them, 'You can go up to Jerusalem for the feast anytime you desire, but the time is not right for Me
In this way we will be able to live a life that is righteous toward ourselves peaceful with others and joyful in the Holy Spirit before God
In other words, in God's eyes, we saved ones are not only saved into His kingdom but also constituted to be His kingdom
In such an authority and under such an authority, there is naturally a kingdom; this authority forms a kingdom
On the cross the Lord Jesus bore the sins of fallen mankind; He cleansed away their sins through His death and the shedding of His blood
Brother Nee eventually preached the gospel to him, led him to be saved, read the Bible to him every day, and explained the truth to him
It was not until the wine was removed that they were able to joyfully ask for the Lord's blessing and take the meal together
In the past someone might have overseen us outwardly, but as long as he could not see us, we did whatever we wanted
If all of us saved ones submit to the kingdom's ruling, we will be the kingdom, and the kingdom of God will be us
We have all known a newly saved one whose colleagues, neighbors, and relatives ask, 'What is wrong with this person?
Before being saved he was the center of attention at all the dinner parties among his colleagues any party without him was boring and no fun
Besides being clever and skillful, he was tall and striking in appearance, and he was thus very popular among his colleagues
He still attended some of the dinner parties hosted by his colleagues, but usually he simply sat there quietly
Now he would not lose his temper even if she threw things at him; rather, he would withdraw to his room, kneel down, and pray
The Holy Spirit in Revelation 4 and 5 is the seven Spirits before God's throne , showing that the Holy Spirit is connected to the throne
On the one hand, He is the Spirit of power; on the other hand, He is the reigning Spirit, bringing God's throne into our spirit
There is a throne in heaven but Mussolini did not submit to the authority of the throne in heaven he did not even acknowledge that authority
God's throne is not objective to us but subjective; it is not merely in heaven but has been connected to us inwardly
Today the Holy Spirit in us is the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power; moreover, He is the Spirit of authority
He is in us not only to be our life and our power but also to be our Lord, our King, the reign of God in us, and the authority of God in us
It is disheartening that today's Christianity has been deformed and that even the gospel has been twisted out of shape
Much of the gospel preached by Christianity is concerning heaven, the 'heavenly mansion,' as if the gospel were heaven
His Word clearly indicates that the goal of His gospel is to save man into His heavenly authority, His heavenly kingdom
Men such as Mussolini and Hitler best represent the people on earth who are filled with a spirit of rebellion and boastfully say Who is God
It also says, 'Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
In the Lord's table meeting we often hear the saints offer praises, praying, 'Lord, we thank and praise You for putting Your life in us'
If we are about to lose our temper toward our parents or children, as we begin to lose our temper, the throne will rule over us
Although the responsible brothers always announce that we should come to the meetings early, the saints often come late
After we tell the saints, 'You must rise up early to pray and read the Lord's Word,' they may say, 'I did not go to sleep until 11:00 P
If some Japanese military police came to their home, as soon as they heard the footsteps, they would not dare give any excuses
He often commands us, demands things of us, and even works in us, but we do not respond to Him and are unwilling to submit to Him
We will be persons who are in the kingdom and have a part in the kingdom, and the heavenly authority of the kingdom will be in us
If someone says that we have never submitted to God or been ruled by the throne within, we will feel that we have been wrongly spoken of
These situations show that we are not under the ruling and restriction of heaven; thus, we nullify the heavenly authority in us
As long as we give Him a little opportunity, we will realize that the throne, the ruling, the authority, and the kingdom are still in us
In our speech, attitude, walk, action, and even expression and countenance, we must be restricted by the kingdom
In the future the second meaning of the kingdom, the aspect of the sphere of the kingdom, will be manifested on the earth
Rather, it is something practical, something we can experience today, because it is a living under the ruling of the kingdom in actuality
From the day we are saved, the Holy Spirit is in us, bringing God's throne, the heavenly authority, and the authority of the kingdom into us
If we learn to be under the inward ruling and restriction and practically have this kind of living, we will be in the kingdom
One day when the sphere of the kingdom is fully manifested, we will be able to enter into it and rule and reign with the Lord
We are in the kingdom today not mainly as citizens but as princes who are receiving the training of the ruling the throne and the authority
Only those who receive the training to be under this heavenly authority today will be able to exercise this heavenly authority in the future
If today we learn to be under God's authority, reigning, and ruling, one day He will cause us to rule and reign with His beloved Son
Although this is a matter in the future, it should encourage us to live under the authority of the heavens today
It is easy to see that for a great person to fulfill his desire and manifest his glory, he must possess authority and acquire a kingdom
If he cannot acquire a kingdom and exercise his authority in it, he will have no way to carry out his plans and show forth his glory
Daniel 7:14 also puts these three items together, saying that the Son of Man was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom from God
The Lord continued, 'Your kingdom come' , and then went on to pray, 'Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth'
If the sovereignty of a nation cannot be exercised in a certain place, the laws of that nation cannot be executed there
Once He acquires a kingdom He will be able to exercise His authority carry out His will cause His name to be sanctified and receive glory
We see that these great matters-the will of God, the glory of God, and the sanctification of God's name-depend on God's kingdom
Genesis 1 shows that God gave man the authority to have dominion over all the living things in the sea, in the air, and on the earth
He did not want the Jews to think that the kingdom of God was 'here' or 'there'; actually, the kingdom of God was in their midst
We did not know that the Lord whom we received is not only the Savior and the One who is life but also the King
Once we receive Him into us, we have not only the Savior and the One who is life but also the Lord and the King
When the Lord Jesus was about to depart from the world, He revealed that He would receive for Himself a kingdom and return
God's kingdom and authority had long been with Him, but God had a particular procedure and way of doing things
When the Lord was raised from the dead, He ascended to heaven, and God exalted Him to His right hand, making Him both Lord and Christ
After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, God told Him that He had begotten Him and that He had also made Him King
Because He was exalted, enthroned, and made both Lord and Christ, God gave Him the Holy Spirit, who was then poured out
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit confirms and declares to us the authority that God has given to the Lord Jesus'
God caused the Holy Spirit to enter into those who believed in Jesus, and He also poured out the Holy Spirit upon them
Although the world rejects Christ as King, God nevertheless desires that the gospel would be preached everywhere
When we receive Him as our Savior and when He enters into us as the Spirit, He is not the Lord on the cross but the Lord on the throne
The One whom we receive is the Lord who was nailed to the cross; however, today He is no longer on the cross but on the throne
We must know however that this is a prayer uttered by those whose eyes have not been opened and who have not seen the vision on the mountain
At that time Peter became 'crazy,' or he must have at least been trembling as he was speaking, for people thought that he was drunk
Peter told the people that it was not the time to be drunk, for it was nine o'clock in the morning, and no one drinks at that time
He did not fear the Roman Empire, the Jewish religion, the high priest, the Pharisees, or the elders; he preached Jesus the Nazarene as Lord
The Jesus who enters into us is the Jesus on the throne, the exalted One, the One who was made both Lord and Christ
The Lord on the throne comes into us with His throne; He comes not only to be our life but also to be our authority
He is not only the Jesus rejected by man but also the Christ exalted by God, and all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him
If we speak to the Lord in this way, the Lord will answer, 'If you want life and peace, you must also receive the kingdom and authority
In this way our being becomes the heavenly kingdom; we have the authority, the throne, the King, the reigning, and the ruling within
Strangely, no matter how you try to convince yourself, you still will not have peace; He is still not responding in you
You may give many reasons, and all the reasons may be logical, but your inward feeling will be contrary and disagree with you
When he sat at the dining table and was asked by his wife to pray and give thanks for the meal, he could not utter a word
Sometimes a cab driver refuses to give us our change of fifty cents, but if we consider, 'I am a son of the King of kings
Today if you are a saved person and you take care of this mystery within, you will constantly experience the ruling of the kingdom in you
Many times a couple does not present their case to a judge in a law court; instead, they bring their case to their children
You may lie on your bed, looking at the ceiling and groaning a little, but you will not be able to pray a genuine prayer
If we behave in this way, it is as if the throne is not in us, and there is no kingdom, no king, no authority, and no ruling in us
In our feeling, however, we are unable to rise up; instead, our spirit is low, and we are not able to praise, pray, or read the Bible
The glorious Lord, the great King, today dwells humbly in us, desiring to set up His throne and establish His kingdom in us
Throughout the past two thousand years the Lord's kingdom has apparently been weak, but actually, it is strong and great
Today Jesus Christ is great and vast on the earth; His throne, His authority, and His kingdom have been established in thousands of people
It is no wonder that at the end of Napoleon's life he exclaimed, 'O Jesus the Nazarene, You have conquered me!
You, on the contrary, have never fought any battle, yet You have set up Your throne in many places on the earth'
The authority of the entire universe, the authority in heaven and on earth, and God's entire kingdom are in us
If we live under this light, we will be in a condition and live a life that the people of the world cannot live
If the Lords throne is in us and the Lord is reigning on the throne then from the throne of God and of the Lamb the water of life will flow
We need to see that once the throne is set up in us, life will flow, and this flow will become our inward supply, our inward strength
When this is our experience, we will be in His glory, and this will bring in His kingdom, His reigning, and will bring Him down from heaven
May the Lord grant us mercy to see that being a Christian is a matter not only of being spiritual but also of submitting to authority
We must see that the Lord in whom we believe is the King of kings, the Lord who has received the authority on the throne
If we live in such a condition from the throne within us will flow the living water the water of life which will supply the need of others
If we read through the Scriptures carefully, we will see that from beginning to end God desires to obtain a sphere for His reign
After Genesis 1, which speaks of God's desire that man would exercise dominion for Him on the earth, Genesis 2 presents the tree of life
In order for man to touch God's reign and bring God's authority to the earth, he must receive God's life inwardly
Not only should there not be the act of murder, but there also should not be the motive to murder, which is anger
When God gave the law to man, He never intended that man would keep it; He knew that man would not be able to keep it
When we read all these requirements, we can only say that they are beyond our reach; they are exceedingly high and unattainable
The requirements of the kingdom are not meant to be met and fulfilled by us; they are to be met and fulfilled by God's life
The requirements of the kingdom speak forth how able God is; the requirements of the law, on the other hand, speak forth how impotent man is
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
When someone slaps us on our right cheek, we need to turn to him the other also-this is not something that we can do
If we are regenerated, we can see the kingdom of God; if we have God's life, we have the way to enter into the kingdom of God
It requires us not merely to be perfect or excellent but to be like God and ultimately to be perfect as God is perfect
When He enters into us as our life, He supplies us with the power that enables us to do what we otherwise cannot do
It is regrettable that although many of God's children know that God's life is in them, they have not seen the requirements of God's kingdom
You need to give yourself to Him, allow Him to be the King of kings, allow Him to set up His throne in you, and allow Him to reign in you
He has placed the highest requirements on us, and He would not allow us to lose our temper or even to have a small impure thought
If so, you must submit yourself before His throne and have a time to give yourself to Him, telling Him, 'You are my Lord
Many Christians confess that not long after they were saved, the Spirit of the Lord Jesus asked them to allow Him to have room in them
She said, 'Our teacher in the children's meeting told us that if we love the Lord Jesus, we must give ourselves to Him
The church is the place where God exercises His authority, and the throne of God's Son is set up among the churches
They will listen to messages, attend meetings, study the Word, and pray, but they will not yield the authority within them to the Lord Jesus
It is because the Lord desires only to set up His throne within us; He cares only for the authority, the ground, and the dominion within us
Some brothers and sisters ask the Lord for help not only in spiritual things but also in material things in their living
Rather, we should 'seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,' and all the things we need will be added to us
When a disobedient child asks his parents for something to eat, although the parents give him what he asks for, they do so without joy
They reckon themselves dead, but the more they reckon themselves dead, the more they are alive and unable to die
We must see that life flows out of the throne, and the supply of life is for the fulfilling of the kingdom requirements
We must ask such a sister, 'In your daily life, do you make all the decisions, or does the Lord make the decisions?
In the Old Testament when the children of Israel allowed God to be their King, all the enemies around them fell and were subdued
Whenever the children of Israel forsook God, rejected God's authority, and acted according to their own will, their enemies all rose up
As a result, the holy city was trampled, the holy temple was destroyed, the Ark was captured, and the people of God became captives
The solution to all our problems depends on our giving ourselves to Him so that His kingdom can become a reality in us
From chapter 2 we can see the constituents of the man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod
Those who keep the Lord's works until the end are the overcomers who will shepherd the nations with an iron rod
As a result of their being raptured, verses 7 and 8 say, 'There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon
When the overcomers are raptured to heaven, the devil will be cast down from heaven, and heaven will be thoroughly cleared up
Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time'
It is clear from the Lord's Word that God's glory depends on God's authority, and the exercise of God's authority depends on God's kingdom
It is amazing that in the Bible God places all these three things-His kingdom, His authority, and His glory-upon His Son
When His Son is glorified through reigning in the kingdom, God Himself will be glorified in and through the Son
If we do not allow the Lord to obtain a kingdom in which He can reign, the glory of God that rests on Him will have no way to be expressed
If God's kingdom comes to the earth, His will and His authority will be brought to the earth, and His glory will be expressed on the earth
To pray for the coming of God's kingdom is to ask God to set up His throne on earth and exercise His authority on the earth
He said that one day He would receive His kingdom and return; that day of the Lord's return will be the day of His second coming
After He was raised from the dead, He told His disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
He has apparently already received His kingdom, for all authority has been given to Him in heaven and on earth
God has given the kingdom to the Lord; God the Father has given to the Son all authority in heaven and on earth
For this reason, the Lord Jesus was able to tell the disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
The Son of God received authority from God to establish His kingdom on earth, but the situation on earth does not match this
According to God, David was the king whom He had appointed, but the earth was filled with rebellion against David
The parable in Luke 19 indicates that His citizens the people on earth sent an envoy to tell Him We do not want this man to reign over us
The devil instigated men on earth from within to say to the God of heaven, 'We do not want Jesus of Nazareth to reign over us'
Formerly they followed Satan to rebel against the Lord, but now we must bring them into submission to the Lord
The Lord is not only the Lord who created the universe; He is also the King anointed by God, the King of kings appointed by God
Satan instigated the people on earth to declare to God, 'We do not want Jesus, whom You appointed, to reign over us
To repent means that originally we were rebellious and against God, but then a voice of love asked us to return, to turn back, to God
When we receive Him as our Savior, He enters into us to set up His throne and establish His kingdom in us so that we may become His kingdom
His purpose is to rule, to reign, to accomplish His will on earth, and to gain a group of people on earth to be under His authority
As our Savior, the Lord is no longer on the cross; rather, He has passed through the cross and has been enthroned
The Lord enters into us not only to be our Savior but also to be our King, connecting the throne in heaven and the authority in heaven to us
After we are saved, we often have this experience-the Lord desires to establish His kingdom in us, yet we are not willing
The Lord's life in us is not for us to meet merely a small demand but for us to meet the great demand of the kingdom
If we hope only that the Lord's life will prevent us from losing our temper and make us a meek person, the Lord's life will not comply
The Lord will not pay attention to this kind of hope, because His life is given to us to supply us to meet the kingdom requirements
He is the King appointed by God, the Lord of all, who has received all authority in heaven and on earth; God has given all things to Him
We should desire to submit ourselves to Him, receive Him, and allow Him to establish His authority, His throne, and His kingdom in us
We should not be those who by our will determine to be meek, who by our effort try to be patient, or who by ourselves try to be perfect
Every sin and temptation, whether it is from the devil, the evil spirits, the flesh, or fleshly lusts, will be defeated
Whenever they allowed God to rule and reign, all the enemies around them surrendered, and they had peace in all their borders
Whenever they did not allow God to rule or reign over them, they fell, and their enemies rose up one after another
As a result, the holy city was destroyed, the holy temple was trampled, and all the vessels in it were carried away
When we allow Christ to reign in us, we are able to praise and give thanks in every situation that we encounter
When Christ is not able to reign in us, and we do not give Him the ground within, we will immediately begin losing our temper and murmuring
If a brother is not a kingdom person within and is not living a life ruled by Christ often Christs life will not bear responsibility for him
In these last two thousand years the line of such persons who submit to the Lord's authority has never been broken
Throughout the ages there have always been such persons, a group of those who love the Lord and who are willing to submit to His ruling
No matter where we go, we can always find some Christians, and among them we can always find some who love the Lord in this way
It seems that when they mention the Lord, they do not care for anything else; they are not concerned with anything but the Lord
The reason his father asked him this was that in his father's eyes, this young man knew nothing except the Lord Jesus
The condition of the church is weak, as represented by a woman, but the overcomers are like a strong man-child
When they learn of the need to pay a price to follow the Lord, they decline, saying, 'Do we not receive everything as a gift from the Lord?
Everyone who truly loves the Lord is strong; everyone who faithfully loves the Lord fears neither heaven nor earth
In the woman in Revelation 12 there is a man-child; this means that in the weak church there is a group of strong overcomers
When this trial comes upon the church, the man-child will be brought forth, and the weak ones will flee and hide
When the affliction and the trial come upon the church, the weak will still be weak, and the strong will truly be strong
At that time the woman will cry out because of her pain and her travailing in birth, and the man-child will be brought forth
Through this group of overcomers however the devil will be cast down so that Gods kingdom can come and Christs authority can be carried out
To be a Christian is not merely a matter of being holy and victorious; it is a matter of submitting to the authority of the kingdom
When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth
God's Son, the Lord Jesus, has completed everything pertaining to the receiving of the kingdom and the exercising of authority
All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to preach the gospel to disciple all the nations
On one hand, the Bible reveals the gospel as the gospel of grace, which is for us to become believers through faith
According to the gospel of grace, God is pleased to freely grant us grace, and we can receive this grace simply by believing
To be a disciple, one needs not only to love the Lord above all but also to hate everything apart from the Lord
In Luke 14:27 the Lord went on to say that whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Him cannot be His disciple
In the final instance He said In the same way therefore everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple
Once we pray, confess, repent, believe, and receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we are a believer, a saved one
Every believer should also be a disciple, one who is trained, ruled, led, disciplined, and dealt with by the Lord's kingdom
Their prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power were not what the Lord commanded them to do, but they did them anyway
Some claim that they are serving the Lord, but they are not restricted by the Lord, not subject to His authority, and not ruled by Him
Suppose there is a student who is very diligent; he stays up to study with the lights on even after the time allowed
To the school he is a lawless person because he violates school regulations and disregards the school's authority
Sometimes when the brothers and sisters are stirred up, they zealously preach the gospel and work for the Lord
Sometimes they are so zealous that they do not care about the Lord's will and authority; they simply set their heart to preach the gospel
Someone may exhort them, saying, 'Brothers, based on certain reasons, perhaps for the time being you should not preach the gospel'
It is true that preaching the gospel is a good thing, but we still must preach the gospel under the Lord's ruling and training
As disciples of the Lord today, we should not ask merely whether a certain thing is good or evil, right or wrong
At that time a certain style of fixing women's hair in place had been introduced, but most women still kept their hair close to their head
Because her former appearance was odd and out of the ordinary, her toppled 'tower' naturally drew people's attention
Her cousin answered, 'We do not know what happened, and we dare not ask, because she is a person with a strong disposition'
Those who allow Him to reign are His disciples who are trained, taught, disciplined, and ruled by Him in His kingdom
We should not only go against the worldly trend, but we should also go against the worldly and degraded condition of all of Christianity
The people in the world do not allow the Lord to reign over them, nor do most in Christianity allow the Lord to reign over them
We saved ones must be an anti-testimony on the earth and allow the Lord Jesus to be our King to rule and reign over us
Although the world rebels against Him and rejects His reigning, we should be able to say, 'Lord, come to us, reign over us, and reign in us
If they are with us for a period of time, they will be influenced by us to come under the authority of the Lord Jesus
The reason for this is that these Christians themselves are leading a sloppy life without the Lord's restriction and ruling
When some older sisters see the change of apparel in a young sister who is ruled by the Lord, they are too timid to say anything at first
Since we are living in a large metropolitan area, does it really matter if we slightly improve our appearance and apply some cosmetics?
We have seen some brothers and sisters who have not changed much in more than twenty years; they have been leading a shallow Christian life
When people have been with us for a long time, they should be brought under the Lord's authority and be His kingdom
If we are those who live in the kingdom, we will surely do all that we can and spend all that we have for the propagation of the gospel
Our Lord should be the King, the kingdom should be returned to Him, and the government should be on His shoulders
The reason God desires that His Son gain a kingdom is that God may exercise His authority and express His glory
God's intention is to show Satan that there is a creature who is subject to God's authority and who chooses to stand on God's side
God wants to prevent Satan from being able to say, 'God, because You are the Creator, You force man to submit to Your authority
He saw that all his blessings were gone, all his protection vanished, and he was completely in a situation of suffering
He submitted to God's authority to the extent that he said, 'Jehovah gives and Jehovah takes away; / Blessed be the name of Jehovah'
We may think that since Satan is so evil, God should simply move His finger so that Satan will be terminated and will be in the lake of fire
Although Satan rebels against God and opposes Him, God is so great that He still allows Satan to come before Him
The pain of losing his possessions outside of him is only temporary; a man's possessions do not mean as much to him as his own body
No matter how much Job suffered or how much he was troubled and afflicted, he still knew that God was his Lord, his King
God can silence Satan by showing him a group of people on the earth whom He has gained and who submit to His authority
If we, as saved ones, give ground for Satan to make such accusations, our God will be forced to remain silent in heaven
Although his wife tries to provoke him in this way, this brother would still testify that the Lord is the Lord and the King
Thank God that among His children there have been some throughout the ages who have loved Him and submitted to His authority
When the man-child is fully formed within the woman, God will be able to judge the world and bring in His kingdom through His judgment
Even until today He still has not come back to judge the earth because there are not enough overcomers to allow Him to begin this judgment
Today we can tell ourselves and others that it does not matter, but one day Christ will come, and His eyes will be like a flame of fire
He was frightened to the point that his entire body trembled, because Christ came when he was sitting in a movie theater
It is because of this that even the apostle Paul said that he dared not examine himself, but He who examined him was the Lord
We cannot say that we are not saved, that we do not have the Lord's life, or that we do not have the Holy Spirit
In the same way, when we use the life, the Holy Spirit, and the talent we have received from the Lord, there will be a full result
Of course it is not good enough, for this one did not faithfully use the gifts that he had received from the Lord
After listening to the slave who had received one talent, the master did not refute him or say, 'Your word is not true
If we have built with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will immediately be consumed when it passes through the fire
The matter of salvation has already been resolved, but the matter of reward is an issue that has not yet been resolved
His face will shine as the sun shines in its power, and His feet will be like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace
God has an administration toward the entire universe and the whole human race, and much more toward His children and His house, His church
In order to obtain such a kingdom in the universe, He must take certain steps in His governmental administration
After Satan tempted man to rebel against God the first step God took in the execution of His administration was to give His salvation to man
Since God has such a plan, He executes it accordingly, carrying out His salvation in us so that we may become His kingdom
Since the first step of God's administration is to make us His kingdom, He must take the second step to execute His administration in us
After we are saved, He desires that we continually submit to the authority of the kingdom, that is, that we be ruled by the kingdom
If God gave us merely teaching or exhortation, it would indicate that He desired only that we be perfectly good men
After we are saved, the second step of God's work in us is a governmental administration, a governmental execution
It is not sufficient for us merely to be perfect, nor is it adequate for us merely to have the thought to do good
The reason we conduct ourselves and work in a certain way is not merely so that we would do good but so that we would be ruled by God
The reason we do not do things or act in a certain way is not merely to avoid making mistakes but so that we would be ruled by God
Under the ruling of His kingdom God does not permit His children to lose their temper freely or treat their wives loosely
If a brother treats his wife properly, it indicates not only that he is a good husband but also that he submits to God's authority
The Holy Spirit who dwells in us often demands that we deal with our family with meekness and treat others with considerateness
The Holy Spirit gives us the feeling that if we do not treat our family with meekness, we are rebelling against God's rule
He had repented and confessed, but after the incident he still was not under God's ruling; he lost his temper as it pleased him
It may take half a year or a year for him to recuperate by being confined to bed and thereby being disciplined by God
In another situation, after a brother is saved, he may continue to love the world, going from place to place in the world
It seems that with some brothers, the more they love the world, the more they prosper, succeed, and make money
According to our understanding, whoever loves the world will be chastised by God or have his worldly things destroyed by God
When children make a mistake, if their parents chastise them immediately, this indicates that the parents are hot tempered
They wait to discipline the children until the weekend or until after the children finish an examination in school
If parents immediately discipline and chastise their children, it shows that their temper is hot and their mind is narrow
In caring for our children of different ages, we all have different ways of handling things according to their different needs
The next day her older brother commits the same mistake and she is happy because she will have someone as a companion in having been spanked
The father thus took care of his son's need, wanting him to study well, but his younger daughter was upset when she saw that
As it seemed good to them' , meaning that fathers know how to discipline their children in the most profitable way
When we exhort others, we should not only say that the Lord is desirable; we should also speak concerning the fear of the Lord
It is not possible for us to enjoy the dispensing of His grace without experiencing the carrying out of His administration
If we are a saved one, we should be under His ruling; this is according to the principle of His administration
As long as we do not live under the ruling of His life, sooner or later we will experience His environmental discipline; this is unavoidable
Suppose that a saved one remains merely saved acting according to his own desire for his whole life and never caring for Gods administration
He grants us salvation so that we may submit to His Son and be children of obedience who submit to His authority and rule
He saw the future judgment the coming glory of the kingdom and the prize that the Lord had set before him for him to obtain in Christ Jesus
Paul used this as an illustration to show the Corinthian believers that from the time they were saved, they were running on a racecourse
If they ran well and finished ahead of the other runners, they would receive the prize, but if they did not run well, they would suffer loss
It was because he feared that he would be loose and thus not submit to God's authority and be under the ruling of the heavens
Paul first wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, and then a few years later he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians
At that time he was nearing the end of his race, but he still dared not say that he would obtain the prize from the Lord
In 1 Thessalonians 4, when Paul spoke concerning the hope of the believers, he said that all the believers would be resurrected
All the dead believers will be resurrected, but only some will obtain an extra-resurrection, an out-resurrection
The top student takes the examination as everyone else does, but the examination to him is an outstanding examination
In his later years in the Roman prison Paul still did not dare say that he had already obtained the prize of the out-resurrection
In 2 Timothy 4:6 Paul said that the time of his departure was at hand; that is, he was about to be executed and martyred
Paul's entire life was a drink offering; his life was wine poured out before the Lord whom he loved, served, and followed
In 2 Timothy 4 Paul solemnly charged Timothy by the appearing of Christ Jesus and His kingdom to faithfully carry out his work
Paul did this because he knew that the matter of the Lord's appearing and His kingdom is a solemn and grave matter
He knew that when the Lord comes, all the saved ones will stand before Him and be judged by Him according to what they have done
When the Lord comes, we will stand before Him to settle our account with Him, making everything clear and answering for everything
Matters such as how we conduct ourselves and how we work after we are saved must be clearly examined before the Lord
He will determine our position in the glory of the kingdom according to our submission to the heavenly ruling from the time of our salvation
It is for this reason that the Lord's appearing and His kingdom were a warning as well as an incentive to the apostle Paul
He was one who daily lived in the light of the Lord Jesus' coming, who was under the Lord's judgment, and who faced the glory of the kingdom
We see that Gods kingdom is Gods administration and since it is Gods administration it is a warning as well as an incentive to us from God
Because Satans work came in and caused complications today the kingdom has three aspectsits reality its appearance and its manifestation
Chapter 13, composed of the parables spoken beside the sea, contains prophecies concerning the appearance of the kingdom
In Matthew 13, while speaking beside the sea, the Lord used seven parables to show the progression of the church
It signifies a heart that is hardened by worldly traffic, which makes it difficult for the seed to penetrate it
It is easy for the birds of heaven, signifying the devil, to devour the word that is heard by those whose heart is in this condition
The second category is the rocky places, signifying a heart with hidden sins and the world as 'rocks' deep within it
Apparently, it is easy for someone with this kind of heart to receive the Lord's word and for the word to spring up and grow quickly
The third category is the earth with thorns, which signifies a heart filled with the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches
They may have different gifts when serving, but they do not have any distinction when gathering before the Lord
According to the Scriptures, even one who has believed and been saved but has committed a gross sin should be removed from the church
When the Lord comes, at the time of the harvest, only then will He collect the false Christians out of the world and cast them into the fire
Because of the addition of the tares the false Christians to the church the nature of the church changed the small herb became a great tree
In Matthew 13:32 the word birds is in the plural number, referring to Satan, his angels, and people who belong to Satan
From this seed the church, signified by the mustard, is produced to supply people with life and to nourish them
In the principle of God's creation, everything should be according to its kind; only what is according to its kind is from God
Using plants to illustrate, we are not like great trees; rather, we are like herbs, which are often trampled by man yet do not resist
If man tramples us to the uttermost, even into the ground, we must remember that the grain that falls into the ground will still grow up
Our service today should be like an herb that feeds and supplies people inwardly rather than a great tree that is manifested outwardly
Paul was truly talented, yet he was not a great tree but a very sweet herb that supplied not only those in his time but also us today
Our meeting halls should not bear the appearance of cathedrals; that would indicate the condition of being a tree
Our meeting halls should be only for covering us from the sun and shielding us from the rain, for we are an herb, not a great tree
The work of this adulterous woman is to mix leaven into the three measures of meal, thereby causing the whole to be leavened
In the Bible fine flour signifies Christ as food to God's people, such as the fine flour used in the meal offering in the Old Testament
Although the Catholic Church takes the truth as the basis for everything she does, the mixture of heresy has been added
In Revelation the church in Thyatira, to whom one of the seven epistles was written, is the fulfillment of this fourth parable
According to this parable, Christianity is not merely great in appearance but also has become corrupted in content
They would twist the word in the Scriptures in order to give the word of the Catholic Church a higher position
When the word in the Scriptures differs from the word of the Catholic Church, they would rather listen to the word of the Church
The Catholic Church as the evil woman has mixed things other than Christ, corrupted things, into the teaching of the Bible
The reason we do not allow women to teach is to show that we do not accept the mixed teaching of the so-called Church
When the Lord spoke beside the sea, the people did not understand Him; only those who followed the Lord into the house could understand Him
Those who were in the house signify people who are hidden and have the Lord's presence; only they can understand His speaking
The field here refers to the world in the positive sense; it signifies the earth that God created and desires to gain for His kingdom
The treasure hidden in the field signifies God's authority, that is, the kingdom, hidden on the earth that God created and desires to gain
When the Lord came out to preach, He found the kingdom that had been hidden by God from the foundation of the world
The parable in Matthew 13:44 reveals that from the foundation of the world God never made this kingdom known to man
After the Lord found the kingdom He hid it again and then sold all that He had by going to the cross in order to redeem the Godcreated earth
Because they rejected Him, Matthew 11:25 says that the things concerning the Lord were hidden from the wise and intelligent
The first hiding is related to the hidden things mentioned in verse 35; the kingdom was hidden from the foundation of the world
The explanation of the second hiding is found in 11:25, which says, 'You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent'
The Lord's doing signs was a matter of authority; His sending the disciples to cast out demons was also a matter of authority
In Matthew 12:28 the Lord said to those Jews, 'If I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you'
At the end of chapter 12 the Lord said, 'Whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother'
Following this, in chapter 13 the Lord spoke in parables concerning the kingdom in order to hide the kingdom from the Jews
On one hand, He spoke in parables in order to hide the kingdom, and on the other hand, He explained it clearly to the disciples
It was half hidden the second time, meaning that it is hidden to the people without but revealed to the people within
It is not enough for God to have only the earth as the sphere; He must also gain man in order that man might rule on the earth
Because the emphasis of the Gospel of Matthew is the kingdom, it mentions the kingdom first and then the church
The treasure was hidden in the field, which refers to the world in the positive sense, the earth created by God
On one hand, the Lord redeemed the whole earth; on the other hand, He purchased back those whom He desires to gain
We have been delivered out of the world signified by the sea, but we will inherit the world-the earth-signified by the field
When entering the New Jerusalem, one first passes through the gates; then one comes to the wall built with precious stones
The treasure, consisting mainly of precious stones, is formed from the burning heat and intense pressure in the earth
We should not be involved with the tares, the great tree, or the leaven; rather, we must be the treasure and the pearl
The first parable portrays the Lord's coming out to preach the word of life and sow the seed of life in preparation for the kingdom
The extent to which we allow God's life to rule in us is the extent to which God's kingdom, God's authority, will be expressed
Having great value is a result of the Lord's being wounded that we may receive His life and become a precious pearl
Through the burning of the Holy Spirit and the pressure of our environment, we can eventually become precious stones
It is in the sea that the oysters are wounded, which indicates that the Lord produced the pearl after He was wounded in the world
The work produced from wood, grass, and stubble mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:12 is related to the second group of the parables here
The work of the Roman Catholic Church today is all wood, grass, and stubble, a lifeless work, a work that cannot supply life to man
We should not be great before man; rather, we should be willing to humble ourselves to be a small herb and fine flour
The net in this parable signifies the eternal gospel preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation
In the age of grace the Lord gains a small number of people through the gospel of grace; these are regenerated and become the pearl
During the great tribulation, the Lord will send an angel to preach the eternal gospel to charge men to fear God and worship God
Those who receive this gospel are the species of the good; those who do not receive it are the species of the foul
Before the great tribulation the overcoming believers will be raptured, but those who are weak and defeated will remain on the earth
The preaching of the eternal gospel will take place after the rapture of the hundred and forty-four thousand overcomers
Just before this persecution God will send an angel to preach the eternal gospel to charge man to fear God and worship God
Following this, an angel will gather the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God
The Lord spoke the seventh parable to show that He will deal with these living ones based on the eternal gospel
When the two witnesses come perhaps at the time when the harvest is reaped they will be the last ones who uphold Gods interests on the earth
The three and a half years of the great tribulation cannot be considered the age of grace or the age of the kingdom but a transition period
John the Baptist preached the word but not the gospel of life; it was the Lord who preached the gospel of life
Since the disciples asked these three questions so clearly, the Lord surely would not give them a vague answer
The Lord's word covers these three groups, on which the aforementioned three sections of Matthew 24 and 25 are based
Matthew 24 mentions the Holy Place, those in Judea, the Sabbath, and the chosen, indicating that this word was spoken to the Jews
Finally, in the third section, instead of speaking only in parables, the Lord spoke in plain words with parables
Chapter 13 does not cover the responsibility of the church, and chapters 24 through 25 do not cover the constitution of the church
The word regarding the church in Matthew 24 and 25 is mainly concerning our responsibility in these two aspects
Concerning the aspect of life, we need to be watchful and prepared; concerning the aspect of work, we need to be faithful
The parable of the slaves in verses 14 through 30 concerns the matter of faithfulness, which is also related to the dead believers
A long time signifies the entire church age; this indicates that they will already be dead when the Lord returns
One must first be watchful and prepared in order to be mature in life and be filled with the Holy Spirit; then one can be faithful in work
When we contact a proper believer, we will sense the light in him; every place where he is, is bright because he takes his lamp with him
Some believers, however, are no different from the unbelievers, because they do not take their lamps with them
It signifies not the Spirit poured on the believers outwardly but the indwelling Holy Spirit who causes the believers to shine
Five is composed of four plus one as illustrated by our five fingers four fingers belong to one group and to these four the thumb is added
If he spends all that he has, his vessel will be emptied out to allow for the filling of the oil, the Holy Spirit
Both the prudent and the foolish in the parable are virgins, and they all take their lamps to go forth to meet the bridegroom
They are foolish because they have not paid the price that they should have paid in order to receive the Holy Spirit
To be foolish is to not recognize what is truly precious but to instead treasure something else and thereby abandon the Holy Spirit
That the virgins become drowsy and sleep has nothing to do with watchfulness, because even the prudent ones sleep
All the dead and immature saints cannot be gathered into the barn after they die; they must first be worked on until they are ripe
Although they eventually obtained the oil, the door was already shut, and they could not partake of the wedding feast
The virgins who mature early can partake of the wedding feast; those who mature later will not be allowed to partake of the wedding feast
The marriage feast will be a celebration for a thousand years, but for the foolish it will be a time of punishment
All of them have been regenerated, but the prudent have the filling of the indwelling Spirit, whereas the foolish do not
In the aspect of work they are slaves who have finished their work; it is not until the Lord comes that He will settle accounts with them
In other words, the saints should have the living described in chapter 24 and the status, condition, and way described in chapter 25
Rather, it will be while we are living an ordinary daily life of working in the field or grinding at the mill that some will be taken
The unfaithful one in the parable beat his fellow slaves ; this signifies criticizing and judging the brothers and sisters
An unfaithful one, however, without waiting for an explanation, criticizes and judges his companions when he sees that they are weak
Only an unfaithful serving one who falls short in his serving and who does not exercise his gifts will criticize and judge others
The Lord indicated in this parable that to be faithful is to minister to others and that to be unfaithful is to criticize others
When a faithful one sees his brother make a mistake, he always thinks of a way to resolve the mistake and minister life
To be faithful is to minister to and serve the brothers and sisters according to the supply of grace we have received in our daily living
The unfaithful slave who beat his fellow slaves and the unfaithful slave who hid his one talent both indicate the same thing
In this way, the help we render is our capital, and the help to others rendered by the one whom we help is our interest
If the Lord gives us five talents, we should use these five talents; our using these talents is our gaining them
In the aspect of life we are not required to do something great; rather, we need to care for the indwelling Spirit in our daily living
Concerning our responsibility in the aspects of life and work, we need to be mature in life and faithful in our work
We may say that early maturity is the entrance to receiving the reward, and faithfulness determines the content of the reward
In other words, being faithful causes us to receive a reward; its emphasis is not on causing us to enter into the kingdom
Matthew 25 shows that one can buy oil to reach maturity after the resurrection, but that one will not have the opportunity to be faithful
Maturity is the prerequisite to our entrance into the kingdom; faithfulness is the prerequisite to our receiving a reward
We have seen that oil signifies the indwelling Holy Spirit and that talents signify the gifts of the Holy Spirit
If the saints are not filled with the Holy Spirit, they will not be able to properly exercise the gifts of the Holy Spirit
In the aspect of work, we must exercise the gifts of the Holy Spirit; that is, we must serve the Lord faithfully and properly
The entrance into the kingdom depends on our maturity in life; the receiving of a reward depends on our faithfulness in the work
All those who do not receive the eternal gospel who do not fear God and who kill rather than help the saints will be counted by God as evil
From this we see that the brothers are the Lord's members; they are the saints who are left behind to pass through the great tribulation
They say that the unbelievers are not the Lord's sheep, and it is impossible for the unsaved ones to go into eternal life
Our answer is that Psalm 100 says that all the people on the earth are the sheep of God's pasture, whom God cares for and nourishes
In Luke 15 the ninety-nine lost sheep signify the people of the world; only the one that is found is a saved one
Consequently, the first reason for believing that the sheep in Matthew 25 do not refer to unbelievers cannot be validated
Matthew 25 says that the righteous will go into eternal life , but this is different from the believers' having eternal life
The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world is for man's enjoyment, and the eternal fire is prepared for the devil and his angels
The sheep enter into a kingdom, which is a sphere; the goats enter into the lake of fire, which also is a sphere
The eternal punishment spoken of in Matthew 25:46 is the lake of fire, and the eternal life is the prepared kingdom
The judgment of the saints at the Lord's judgment seat will be in the air, because they will have been raptured
He did not strive or cry out, nor could anyone hear His voice in the streets , but He was full of the ruling authority
If we apply all these points, we will have the living described in Matthew 5 through 7 and will live in the reality of the kingdom
Only such people can truly experience Emmanuel, God with us, and Jesus, the One who saves His people from their sins
Those who do not have this light may still have peace even if they become a part of the great tree and mix leaven into the fine flour
