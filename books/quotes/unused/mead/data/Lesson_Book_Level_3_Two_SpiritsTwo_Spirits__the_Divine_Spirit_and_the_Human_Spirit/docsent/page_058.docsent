   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Sense of Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a contrast in Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Apostle says that the result of minding the flesh is death, whereas the result of minding the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word reveals that just as the flesh is versus the spirit, so also the result of minding the flesh, which is death, is opposite to the results of minding the spirit, which are life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus the Apostle tells us here that death is not only the opposite of life, but also the opposite of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the sense of death is not only the opposite of the sense of life, but also the opposite of the sense of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sense of life makes us feel fresh, lively, satisfied and vigorous; the sense of death makes us feel the opposite of these old, depressed, empty and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sense of peace makes us feel natural, restful, comfortable, and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The consciousness of death makes us feel just the opposite of these unnatural, unrestful, uncomfortable, and uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, whenever we feel inwardly desolate, depressed, empty, dry, weak and powerless, dark and dull, or uneasy, insecure, uncomfortable, out of harmony, full of conflict, unnatural, sad, and bound, we should know we are not living in the spirit; rather we are living in the opposite of the spirit, which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, by knowing the opposite of the spirit, we may know the spirit itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LIVING IN THE SPIRIT A. Taking Care of the Inner Sense</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't argue with the inner sense of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Don't say that something is good, scriptural, or holy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don't reason and don't argue that what you are doing is for the gospel or for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The test is do you have the inner sense of life and peace?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more you reason with this sense, the more you argue, the more you will sense death within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can know the spirit just by this inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are going to differentiate the spirit and the soul, we must deny the rational mind, emotion, and will all the time and take care of the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Christian Life According to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose we find something that we would like to purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we consider it, the more we feel that we would like to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, we make the decision to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The emotion is exercised, since we like it; the mind is exercised, because we have considered it; and the will is exercised because we have made the decision to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore the whole soul is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when we go to buy it, something very deep within us protests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our emotion likes it, our mind considers it, and our will chooses it, but something deeper within us protests.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever we do, regardless of whether we think it is right or wrong, spiritual or unspiritual, if deep within us we feel restless, insecure, empty, and depressed, it proves that we are walking by the flesh and not living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even in prayer and preaching, not to mention other things or doing things which are not good, if we feel empty and depressed within, dissatisfied or unhappy, then it is proof that we are praying or preaching by the flesh, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian walk, the Christian life, the Christian activity is not according to the standard of good or bad, but absolutely according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would know this one thing and be ruled and controlled by it, the Lord would transform our inward being and our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The human spirit can be known by the senses of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because God Himself is in our spirit, we sense life and peace when our mind is set on the spirit and we are living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And when we are not in our spirit, we experience the opposite the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christian life is not a matter of right and wrong; it is a matter of living by the inner sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>QUESTIONS What are the three senses of the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What verse backs this up?</S>
