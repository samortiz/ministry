   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>unto Jehovah Their God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah also demanded that Pharaoh allow the children of Israel to sacrifice to Jehovah their God v. 3 . Sacrifice is a word parallel to feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To the children of Israel, the feast was a feast, but to God it was a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the sacrifice, there was nothing to feast on.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What the children of Israel were to feast on was the very sacrifice they were to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Passover illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The lamb sacrificed to God was food for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This reveals that the feast and the sacrifice are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we sacrifice to God spontaneously becomes our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This also is dispensational worship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of worship does not require that we prostrate ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God did not say, Let My people go into the wilderness so that there they may prostrate themselves before Me. God does not want His people to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants them to sacrifice to Him and to hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s demand placed on Pharaoh we see a perfect, complete salvation for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This salvation includes God s rescuing His people from the usurping hand of Satan and bringing them into the wilderness in resurrection so that they can hold a feast unto Him and sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a wonderful salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Pharaoh,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Symbolizing the Usurping Satan</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Our Satan-possessed and Usurped Self</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we come to Pharaoh s resistance 5:2, 4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pharaoh symbolizes the usurping Satan and our Satan-possessed and usurped self.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the self is Pharaoh in a very practical way, we may be a Pharaoh both to ourselves and to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A husband and wife may be a Pharaoh to each other, and parents may be a Pharaoh to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Pharaoh is one who keeps God s people from feasting unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, five brothers may live together in a brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Three of them may desire to attend the church meeting as they usually do, but the others may restrain them and encourage them to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In doing this, these two brothers become Pharaohs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any time we keep others from feasting unto the Lord or from sacrificing to Him, we are a Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Parents, for example, may be so concerned about their children s education that they forbid them to attend the meetings of the church and require them to devote an unreasonable amount of time to study.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When parents behave in such a way, they are Pharaohs to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes we blame Satan too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, the usurping Satan is Pharaoh in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we are Pharaohs in a practical, subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may be a Pharaoh to ourselves, not allowing ourselves to go into the wilderness to feast unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you check with your experience, you will see that many times you have frustrated yourself from feasting unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have kept yourself away from the meetings of the church, perhaps with tiredness as your excuse for not attending the church feast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although you may have claimed to be too tired to attend the meetings, you were full of energy to talk on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not think that today only Satan himself is Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone can be a Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever the self is possessed by Satan and usurped by him, the self becomes a subjective Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Denying Jehovah God, Ignoring His Demand,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>and Not Letting Israel Go</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 2 records Pharaoh s resistance in a detailed way: And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we see that Pharaoh denied Jehovah God, ignored His demand, and refused to let Israel go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Pharaoh refused even to acknowledge Jehovah, virtually denying Jehovah s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Often when we frustrate others from feasting unto the Lord, we deny the Lord and ignore His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same is true when we hinder ourselves from sacrificing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a very practical way, this means that if we keep ourselves from the church meetings, we are like Pharaoh who denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For us Christians to come together is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we gather together according to the Lord s ordination, we hold a feast unto the Lord and we sacrifice to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose we Christians did not have a proper gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What would the Lord be able to do on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord would not be able to do anything, and He would not receive any real worship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By this we see that the proper gathering together of Christians is of tremendous importance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some of the children of Israel may have thought that as long as they were delivered from the hand of Pharaoh and released from Egypt, everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But that would not have been true.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s chosen people were not only to make their exodus out of Egypt, but they were also to hold a feast unto the Lord in the wilderness and to sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By its very nature a feast is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one can hold a feast alone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To have a feast we must be together with many others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more people there are, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose a dinner of many courses is prepared and set on your dining table at home and you sit down to eat it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is this a feast?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In order for it to be a feast, you must invite a large number of people to eat with you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you have just a few others to dine with you, this meal is still not a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You need a great company.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same principle, no Christian can hold a feast unto the Lord alone or with just a few other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He must attend a proper gathering of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To miss a meeting of the church is to miss a feast and to lose out on the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The loss we suffer in this way is not as serious as the loss God suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do not attend the feast, God has no feast and does not receive the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May we all be deeply impressed with the importance of this.</S>
