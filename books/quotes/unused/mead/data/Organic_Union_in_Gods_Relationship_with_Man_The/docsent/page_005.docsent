   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITH A SPIRIT CREATED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second striking point in the creation of man is that God created man with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Breath of Life Breathed by God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>into Man's Body Formed with Dust</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man of the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No doubt this refers to man's body as the framework of man's being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do have a body formed with dust.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Science tells us that our body is just a composition of the elements of the earth, just like dust.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever is in the dust is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this is not all in God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After God formed a body for man, God breathed the breath of life into man's nostrils.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dust does not have any life, but the breath of God has life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, God's breath is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis 2:7 the word for breath in Hebrew is neshamah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is used also in Proverbs 20:27, which says, "The spirit of man is the candle lamp of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the very breath of life breathed into man's body became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is confirmed by Job 32:8, which says, "But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty are in apposition, indicating that the spirit of man and the breath of God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit of man is the breath of God, and the breath of God is man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God not only formed a body to be the frame of man, but He also produced a spirit to be the very inner organ within man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has prepared a stomach in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The stomach is a physical organ for us to receive, digest, and assimilate food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a similar way, God produced an inner organ, that is, our spirit, for us to use to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This corresponds with the Lord's word in John 4:24: "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only spirit can contact Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only spirit can worship Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is Spirit, and we have a spirit so that we can worship God, we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we stay away from our spirit and remain in our mind, the more we think, the more we consider, the more we will feel that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we turn to our spirit in the inmost part of our being, we will spontaneously worship God, saying, "God, I thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To attempt to substantiate God by using our mind is like trying to smell a fragrance by using our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our eyes simply cannot smell the fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, to us there is no fragrance, because we cannot see it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if we would cease trying to use our eyes and instead use our nose, we would surely smell the fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is a Spirit, and He prepared for us a spirit that we may worship Him, contact Him, receive Him, and even contain Him as our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We Christians are no longer persons without God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we have God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we are not lifeless but are lively, full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this organic life God and we, we and God, have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Spirit of Man Being Ranked</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>with the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>in the Holy Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to realize how important and crucial our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The spirit of man is ranked with the heavens and the earth in the holy Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Zechariah 12:1 the prophet Zechariah said that God stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to this verse three things in the universe are crucial: the heavens, the earth, and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The heavens are for the earth; the earth is for man to exist; and the spirit of man is for God, to worship God John 4:24 , to be regenerated by God John 3:6b , and to be joined to God 1 Cor 6:17 that man may walk and live in the organic union with God Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4b .</S>
