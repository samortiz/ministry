   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO KEEP THE UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the way for such an enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is simply by keeping the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So many today excuse themselves by saying that it was easy in the time of the Apostles, but now it is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that it is impossible to keep the unity; so we must not talk about it; it is enough to talk about the Lord Jesus and help others to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They even say that the more we speak about unity, the more divisions we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we are not in the unity, we will be short of the ointment and the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then it will be difficult for the Lord to command the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we keep the unity?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must see that the unity of the Body is the unity of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The very Spirit Himself is the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To keep the unity simply means to keep the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can only keep what we already have; so the unity of the Spirit is already here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But how can we keep the unity?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the record of the New Testament, to keep the unity in Jerusalem was easy, for there were no other divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And to keep the unity in Antioch was also easy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But to keep the unity in Corinth was not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church in Corinth was divided into four groups: one of Paul, another of Cephas, another of Apollos, and another "of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of these four groups were composed of real believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In such a situation, how could they keep the unity?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we were to keep the unity with those that were of Paul, would that be the proper unity?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may love us, and we may love them, but it would not be the proper unity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would be unity on the ground of Paul, not on the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Old Testament times, Jerusalem was the place chosen by God for His people to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But they were all carried away to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose we were one of those in Babylon; would we be in the proper unity?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may be real, but it would not be proper because the ground is wrong; it is the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the place which the Lord chooses is the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we went to the group of Cephas or Apollos, or even to the one that is "of Christ," the result would be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of how much we love them and are one with them, the ground is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may be real, but it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul says that these are divisions!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So first of all, we must know the unity, and we must know the proper unity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible to keep the proper unity in Babylon or in any of those divisive groups in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must come back to Jerusalem, i.e., the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are in Babylon, we must come back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are in one of the divisive groups in Corinth, we must come back to the ground of unity in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is impossible to have the proper unity in any divisive group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must come back to the one unique ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE COMMANDED BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps you are by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First of all, you must get out of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not say that since you are alone, it is better to wait until the Lord brings others to join you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you take this attitude, you will surely have to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that you are not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are absolute, you will realize that it is impossible to keep the proper unity in any kind of divisive group, regardless of how spiritual you are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must keep yourself from anything divisive and come back to the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are really absolute and mean business with the Lord, you will experience the Lord commanding the blessing of life upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we have the unity, there the Lord commands the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we have the enjoyment of the ointment and the dew of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What has happened in Los Angeles is really a testimony of this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the brothers began to take the standing of unity here on the ground of locality, there has been such an enjoyment of the ointment and the dew!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can never forget the first conference in Los Angeles in December of 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first time we sang "Oh, What a Life!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Oh, What a Peace!" the roof nearly rose to the sky!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There were only about 70 of us, but such a blessing of life!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In all of these past years, I believe the brothers and sisters have tasted the commanding of the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not be afraid that you will be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must be faithful to Him and be absolute for the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just pray, "Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I must take this standing of the local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am not for the ground of any division, but for the ground of the local church."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you take care of the standing of unity, the Lord will take care of the commanded blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord will raise up others to meet with you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then you can testify to the whole universe of the blessing of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The number may be small, but the unity will be real and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The brothers and sisters here can testify by His mercy and grace that we have the real brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not that we encourage the brothers to love.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We simply have the love.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the real unity of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord opens the door, and no one can shut it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In 1932, when the Lord raised us up in North China, we were nearly all young in years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Most of us were under thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We began to meet on a very small scale, and the denominational leaders said, "Let them play.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It will not last long."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But in less than ten years, that little testimony spread throughout North China.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have heard the same thing in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Just recently someone said that the local church will not work here in America.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But let us wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It all depends upon our absoluteness and our faithfulness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>THE KING'S BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If this matter is our business, it means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But if it is His business, it is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The local church is indeed the King's business; so we must take a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Of course, some will oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Nevertheless, we must take the Lord's way of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>And if we take this way, we must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do not feel burdened to take this way, I do not encourage you to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you feel that you have peace in going along with the denominations, just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But if you are going to take the way of the ground of unity, do it in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Do not do it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are in the Lord's recovery, and the time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Luke 21:24 says that Jerusalem will be trodden under the feet of the Gentiles until the fullness of the time of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But Jerusalem has already been returned.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I really believe that the Lord will do a quick work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, I believe that all the scattered brothers and sisters should come together to one or more centers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even the students had better not study in a place without a church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The place to study is where there is a prevailing church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must not put our studies first, but the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even our jobs do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As long as we can make a living, let us be concentrated.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then we can declare to the whole world and to Satan the fact of our unity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The ointment will flow and the dew will come down, and we will see the Lord commanding His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Even the gates of Hades will not be able to stand against us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I do believe that this is the strategic way.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>First of all we must be concentrated, and then equipped to bear the testimony and give the enemy the shame.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Then we will go out to spread the unity of the church life to other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the way to keep the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We must leave all the divisive groups and take the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>And we must seek the Lord's leading for us to be concentrated together.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Of course, no one controls this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We all must seek the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Perhaps the Lord will lead some to meet here in Los Angeles, or with those in Akron, or with those in Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We all must seek the Lord's leading concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is only on the ground of unity that we have the ointment and the dew with the commanded blessing of life.</S>
