 <h2 class="head1">BUILDING SOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH AND<br />
BRINGING IN GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>Paul was the greatest apostle of the Lord. Nevertheless, when he wrote the Epistle of 1 Corinthians, he said, &ldquo;Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother&rdquo; (1:1). Paul&rsquo;s reference to Sosthenes shows that he had a consciousness of the Body and a spirit of coordination. It is doubtful whether many people have paid attention to the name of Sosthenes.</p>
<p>The apostle&rsquo;s spirit is different from ours. The isolation among us is becoming more serious. Everyone is capable, the younger ones and the older ones, and it seems as if there is no need to depend on one another. The older ones think that they are more experienced and know everything concerning the administration of the church. They feel that they know how to be elders. Even though they might not say this, it is the attitude in their spirit. We can be polite and call this a spirit of tearing down, but it is actually a spirit of rebellion. When a brother speaks, some may be critical and say in their heart, &ldquo;I know this already.&rdquo; This kind of spirit is destructive to God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We should not expect our work to be blessed if we are isolated and individualistic. We should not expect such a work to produce the building. Since we minister the word and participate in God&rsquo;s work to some extent, there will be some results. Even the work of the Catholic Church produces some results. We must ask, however, whether this work is producing what God wants. Can the Catholic Church edify two or three million people so that they are in one accord, love one another, and stand for God? The people they edify will be full of opinions. God is not able to build in them. He cannot gain a dwelling place, a habitation, in them.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we see that we need to be built and labor in a work that builds up others. When we bring people to salvation, there must be an element of building. When we bring people to salvation, we not only need to make them spiritual, but we also need to build them up. After being led to the Lord by us, they should not only love the Lord but also be built up with others. In the same principle, the elders not only need to administrate the church, but they also need to build up the church. Then the brothers and sisters under the elders&rsquo; administration will be in one accord and will be willing to submit to others, considering submission as their glory. This is the glorious work that we need to do here.</p>
<p>Capacity alone is not the only measure. Compared to the elders, some younger brothers may be keener in terms of skill and mental capacity. But this does not mean that they can serve as elders. The qualification for being an elder does not depend on skill or mental capacity but on being broken and subdued. It is possible for our service as elders to produce saints who are dissenting and rebellious. Our service may save people and cause them to be spiritual and love the Lord zealously, but they will not be built up. Please allow me to say a solemn word. Since the beginning of the year I have felt that Satan wants us to do a work that is spiritual and full of zeal but which tears down and is lacking in mutual submission.</p>
<p>Many young brothers have been poisoned in this regard. We need to proclaim a warning. Those who desire to serve the Lord must take the way of building. If there is edification but no building, this is the way of rebellion. If there is spirituality but no building, this is the way of Satan. Throughout the two thousand years of church history no person was useful in God&rsquo;s hand who was unwilling to put himself under God&rsquo;s hand and be subdued. The work God desires today is not only to save sinners or edify the saints. The primary work of God is to build a dwelling place.</p>
<p>We should never think that the building is not essential or can be easily &ldquo;manufactured.&rdquo; God must do much work in order to build up an isolated person. He wants us to enter into glory. He wants us to be built up with others into His glorious dwelling place. Unless we are coordinated and built up with others, we cannot enter into glory. If we can coordinate, God will add others to us who can also coordinate. If God cannot build in us today, He will still do it later. Those who enter into God&rsquo;s glory must be built by God.</p>
<p>In order to be built, it is crucial that we are able to coordinate with others. In order to coordinate with others, we need to be broken. We may consider ourselves to be an excellent stone but be unable to be built up. Likewise, we may consider someone who is able to coordinate with others to be an ugly stone. This only shows that being able to be built with others, not spirituality, is what matters.</p>
<p>It is not easy for God to find a group of people who is willing to be subdued and built up by Him. God wants to pour out His blessing, but it is not easy for Him to find such a vessel. The Lord said that if two or three are gathered in harmony, He will be with them, and their prayer will be answered (Matt. 18:19-20). In other words, God&rsquo;s blessing is wherever the building is manifested. If one-tenth of the serving ones in Taipei are in one accord, God&rsquo;s blessing will follow their service. On the contrary, even if there are no arguments in a locality, if there is no building, God&rsquo;s blessing will not be present. God&rsquo;s blessing is based on our one accord, being in harmony in spirit with one another, having real coordination, and having genuine oneness. For example, if five brothers and four sisters meet together, the brothers should be submissive toward one another just like the sisters. If a brother chooses a hymn, everyone should sing together with rejoicing. Such a condition and spirit will bring in God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
