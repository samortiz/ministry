   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we will consider several aspects of how we should conduct ourselves in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Putting Aside Our Personal Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we come to a meeting, we must first put aside our personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have lost our temper before a meeting, we should put aside our anger when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, we will be fully occupied with our feelings throughout the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother may be provoked to anger by his wife and then bring his anger to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then when he prays in the meeting, his anger can be sensed in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not care for the nature or the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His only concern is that his wife has provoked him, and his prayer in the meeting is used as an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides this negative example, there are also positive examples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother is filled with light and joy through reading the Bible at home and is singing Hallelujahs before a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the meeting he excitedly speaks of the light he received at home, disregarding the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that he has not put aside his personal feeling; thus, he cannot touch the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not only apply to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although someone may speak with us for five minutes, and we nod our head in agreement, we may not hear a word of what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because we did not put aside our personal thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are anxiously waiting for an opportunity to speak, we will not hear what others have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to hear what others are saying and realize what they mean, we must put aside our personal thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, in order to touch the feeling of a meeting, we must put aside our personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether we are angry or happy, we need to put aside our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only in this way can we touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Opening Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A closed person can never touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some people come to a meeting with a closed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They come as spectators to watch others perform.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They criticize when others perform poorly and applaud when they perform well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such behavior is from a closed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we come to a meeting, we must open our spirit and be prepared to receive the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Exercising the Spirit to Touch</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>the Feeling of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we put aside our personal feelings and open our spirit, we are qualified to exercise our spirit and touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we touch the feeling of a meeting, we should function accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very important that we be able to touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we cannot touch the feeling, we cannot enter into the flow of the meeting and be mingled with the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since our gathering together is the meeting, we cannot have a personal agenda; rather, we should all move together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we must touch the atmosphere of a meeting and enter into the flow of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing the Progression of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a progression in all meetings: a beginning, a process, and an end. A person who knows how to meet knows the purpose of meeting, prepares himself before a meeting, can sense the feeling of a meeting, and knows the progression of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are many points to be considered concerning how a meeting begins, the steps it passes through, and how it ends.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, a good meeting progresses through eight steps.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may be acceptable for a meeting not to pass through two or three of these steps; however, not passing through more than two or three of these steps will result in a poor meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot have a meeting that has a beginning and an end but only a brief progression in between.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us briefly explain the eight steps through which a meeting progresses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Opening to Begin the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The opening of a meeting is to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not easy to begin a meeting; in fact, the most difficult part of a meeting is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the opening is strong, the whole meeting will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the opening is weak, it will be difficult to strengthen the meeting later.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes a person selects an inappropriate hymn at the beginning and kills the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If another person adds a deadening prayer, the meeting will be put in a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, it is not easy to begin a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to have a good opening, we must accurately touch the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we touch the feeling, it is easier to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can begin by selecting an appropriate hymn, offering a prayer, or speaking a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people are very good at opening a meeting, and the meeting is lively from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Other people, on the contrary, seem to have the capability of deadening any meeting they begin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is like selecting Hymns, #183, Come, let us join our cheerful songs, or Hymns, #127, Hark! ten thousand voices crying, in a funeral meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The meeting will be ruined if it is opened in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the same as singing Hymns, #974, He looked for a city and lived in a tent, at the beginning of a wedding meeting; this is basically a wrong opening.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A wrong opening deadens the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The opening of a meeting is very important and requires much practice.</S>
