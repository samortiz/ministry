   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN ONENESS AND CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 133 THE WAY TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS SEEN IN PSALM 133</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the need to keep the oneness and experience Christ for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in oneness!/It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments;/Like the dew of Hermon /That came down upon the mountains of Zion./For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this short psalm of three verses, there are four important things expressed by four words: first, oneness; second, oil; third, dew; and fourth, life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to practice the church is in these four things: the oneness, the oil, the dew, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This psalm is one of fifteen psalms, from Psalm 120 to 134, which are called Songs of Ascent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are songs chanted by the children of Israel while they were coming together and going up to Mount Zion to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did this three times a year at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, these songs were the songs for their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though the church was not in the Old Testament, the people of Israel were a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In particular, Psalm 133 is related to the way of the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the previous chapter, we saw two things that are crucial to the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One thing is the oneness as the ground of the church life, and the other is Christ as the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the ground and the reality as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we invite people for dinner, we need a table and also a lot of food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot just serve people a table without the food, nor can we serve people the food without a table.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The proper church life is a life of a proper ground, which is the oneness, and of the reality, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have advised me not to talk too much about the ground of the church and to just talk about Christ, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They appreciated the Lord's presence and the reality, but they did not want to speak about the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I said to them, "What you appreciate may be likened to tea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You drink the tea, yet you don't appreciate the teacup.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems that you are saying, Tea is so nice, but the cup is not good for drinking.'</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, I know the cup is not good for drinking, but you need a cup to put the tea in. To serve tea, you need the cup as well as the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, to practice the church, we need the ground as well as the reality of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I appreciate Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 1 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in oneness!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They kept the oneness by coming to the one place appointed, chosen, ordained, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one had the right to set up another place for their coming together to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their worship to God was kept as one for generations and generations because they kept the ground of oneness.</S>
