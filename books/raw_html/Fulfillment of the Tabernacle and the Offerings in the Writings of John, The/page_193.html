<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(18)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:23-24, 27-28; 13:31-32; 15:8; 17:1; 14:2; 15:1; 16:21</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that the main subject of the section of the Gospel of John from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen is the divine glorification. We have also seen that in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen three main things are covered: the Father’s house, the vine, and the new man. Actually, these all refer to the same thing, and they are all related to the divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>THE MULTIPLICATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE SON OF MAN</h2><p>According to 12:23 and 24, the Lord’s glorification is a matter of His multiplication: “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” If, as is commonly supposed, the Father’s house in 14:2 denotes a heavenly mansion, what relationship would there be between this mansion and the multiplication of Jesus for His glorification? The answer is that there would be no relationship between a heavenly mansion and the multiplication and glorification of the Son of Man. To be sure, the Father’s house does not refer to a heavenly mansion. This section of the Word is on the glorification of Jesus through His multiplication in resurrection. A so-called heavenly mansion has no relationship whatever to the multiplication of the Lord Jesus.<p>The vine in chapter fifteen, however, is certainly related to the Lord’s multiplication. In 15:5 the Lord said, “I am the vine, you are the branches.” The branches of the vine are for the multiplication of the vine.<p>The new man in chapter sixteen also is a matter of multiplication. First, there was an individual man—Christ. Then in resurrection He with the believers was born to be a corporate man. This new man, therefore, is also the multiplication of Christ.<p>Although the vine and the new man are related to Christ’s multiplication, a heavenly mansion is not. In keeping with the fact that this section of the Gospel of John is concerned with the Lord’s glorification through His multiplication, the Father’s house in 14:2, as the multiplication of the Lord Jesus, must be the church. In the New Testament the church is called the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15). As the house of God, the church is the multiplication of Christ.<h2 class=head1>NOT A HEAVENLY MANSION</h2><p>Anyone who is clear concerning the basic subject of this portion of the Gospel of John will not oppose us for saying that the Father’s house in 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion. However, some may argue strongly if we present only 14:2 and 3 to them and then try to tell them that the house here is not a mansion in the heavens, but is the church as God’s house on earth today. We may find it very difficult to convince them. But if we ask them to read the five and a half chapters of John from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen and pay special attention to the matter of glorification, they may be convinced to drop their concept and accept the revelation of the pure Word.<p>When we have the opportunity, we should help others see that the word “glorified” is first used in this section in 12:23 and that it is used a number of times throughout this section, in particular in chapter seventeen. Then we should point out that this section is on the glorification of the Lord Jesus, a glorification that involves His multiplication. If the Father’s house in 14:2 were a mansion in the heavens, then it would have nothing to do with the Lord’s multiplication and glorification.<p>We all need to know the truth, experience the truth, and learn to present the truth to others. The best way to present the truth concerning the Father’s house to someone is to read together with him these five and a half chapters concerning the Lord’s glorification. If we read these chapters properly and accurately, it will be clear that there is no way that the Father’s house in 14:2 can refer to a heavenly mansion. Once again I would point out that a heavenly mansion would have nothing to do with the multiplication of the Lord Jesus. The Lord’s multiplication cannot be in the heavens; it must be on earth. Furthermore, His multiplication must be the spread of Himself. The church as the house of God is the genuine spread of the Lord Himself. But a so-called mansion in the heavens, as a physical entity, could never be the Lord’s spread. Therefore, the interpretation which says that the Father’s house is a heavenly mansion is altogether contrary to the context.
