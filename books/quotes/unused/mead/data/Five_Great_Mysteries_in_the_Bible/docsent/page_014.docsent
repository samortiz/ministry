   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST HAVING BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to accomplish God's eternal redemption and plan, Christ as God's Anointed took two great steps.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, as God He was incarnated to become a man John 1:1, 14 , the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b , that He might die and accomplish redemption for us Heb 9:26-28; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, through death and resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b that He may enter into us John 14:20 to be our life Col 3:4 and to live in us Gal 2:20 that we may live Him out Phil 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By these two great steps Christ passed through incarnation and tasted all the sufferings of human life; then He died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From being God He became a man, and from being a man He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus He accomplished God's eternal redemption and full salvation to carry out the commission for which He was anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST BEING ALL-INCLUSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, who is the Spirit indwelling us today Rom 8:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indwelling Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The incarnated Christ is in this Spirit; the resurrected Christ is in this Spirit; even all of the Triune God is in this Spirit for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This life-giving Spirit as everything and as the reality of Christ is in us to be our life and all our supply within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1966, I wrote many hymns in Taiwan, one of which was Hymns, #510: "I've found the One of peerless worth,/My heart doth sing for joy;/And sing I must, for Christ I have:/Oh, what a Christ have I!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this hymn, I pointed out over thirty items of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Christ is all-inclusive!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last part of this hymn says, "My Christ, the all-inclusive One,/My Christ what shall I call?/He is the first, He is the last,/My Christ is All in all."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our Christ, who is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CHRIST AS GOD'S FULLNESS AND GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 1:20 says that through the created things we can know the invisible things of God, both His eternal power and divine characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divine characteristics include glory, truth, wisdom, light, love, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through all the created things, man is able to know all these manifested characteristics of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the very substance of God Himself cannot be expressed by the created things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only a living/ Person Jesus Christ can fully express it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, if we want to know the substance of God, we must know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's substance, which is all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the "effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the created things express are only the outward manifested characteristics of God, not God's intrinsic substance or God's own being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mysterious substance of God, the glorious deity of God, could be expressed perfectly only by the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ was living on the earth, all His move and work showed people God Himself, God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This only begotten Son who declared the Father is God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, His disciples called Him God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What Christ expressed was the overflow of the fullness of the Godhead which was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:16 says, "For of His fullness we have all received."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not only riches, but even more this is fullness, being so full to the extent of overflowing to become an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Lord was so full of God's substance within that He overflowed God's substance to become God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, He is God's fullness and God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Colossians 3:4 goes a step further to tell us that this all-inclusive Christ, who is God's expression, is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not objective but subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is something within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now this Christ is sitting at the right hand of God 3:1 in the heavens, but He is also within us as our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is truly too mysterious and too glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life is the life of God, including all the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we live by this life, we enjoy everything of God!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO THE NEW MAN, THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following this, 3:10-11 tells us that this all-inclusive Christ who is life within us makes us a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This new man is composed of all the saints who have Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The content of this new man is not our natural man: not Scythian nor Jew nor Chinese nor American nor German nor Japanese nor Filipino nor Malaysian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The content of this new man is Christ, who is the mystery of God and who is the life in all men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the life of the new man, and He is everything to the new man.</S>
