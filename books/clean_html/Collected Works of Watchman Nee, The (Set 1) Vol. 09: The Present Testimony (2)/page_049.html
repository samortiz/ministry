<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 26</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>We have seen what a promise is and what a fact is. This morning we will see what God's covenant is. A covenant includes a promise and a fact. Today we will consider in detail what the new covenant includes. God has never established a covenant with the Gentiles. There was no old covenant and no new covenant with them. Before the new covenant, of necessity, there was another covenant that became old; hence, the new covenant. This point relates to biblical knowledge. Originally I had no intention of mentioning this. But, for the sake of helping those who want to study the Bible more and want to understand the origin of the covenant, I have to say something. In the Bible the new covenant is strictly for the Jews, the people of Israel; it is not for the Gentiles. Jeremiah 31:31 says, "Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah." This verse is the first mention in the whole Bible of God's making a new covenant with the Jews. Notice that the covenant was made between God and the house of Israel and the house of Judah. What time does "after those days" in verse 33 refer to? Most people believe that it refers to the beginning of the millennium at the end of the tribulation. They believe that God will not make a new covenant with the Israelites until that time. If this were the case, God has not made a new covenant with us because He has yet to make a new covenant even with the Jews. Please note that only Christ's special grace allows us to participate in the new covenant. The Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus died, He shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant. This blood is the blood of the new covenant. The time for enacting the new covenant between God and the Jews, as mentioned by Jeremiah, will be at the end of the tribulation and the beginning of the kingdom. However, the writer of the book of Hebrews applied Jeremiah's word to us. Matthew 26:28 says that the Lord's blood is the blood of the new covenant, and Hebrews 8:8-13 says that the new covenant belongs to this age. How can we explain this? We have to realize that God made a covenant with Abraham. He did not make a covenant with us. Just as Abraham was justified by faith, we are also justified by faith. Today we can similarly enjoy the future new covenant. We are doing what the Israelites will do in the future. God has put us under the blessing of the new covenant today.</P><P>In Romans Paul told us that a man, through faith, could participate in the covenant God made with Abraham. The same principle applies in obtaining the covenant that God will make with the Jews. As long as we follow the footsteps of Abraham, we will receive the covenant that God gave to Abraham. As long as we trust in the same thing that the Israelites, in the future, will trust in, we will receive the future covenant. Zechariah says that the people of Israel will one day come, believe, and acknowledge Jesus as their Savior, not just as their Messiah. If we believe in the Lord Jesus, as the Jews will believe in the future, God will put us in His new covenant. If we believe what Abraham believed, we will receive Abraham's blessing. If we believe now what the Israelites will believe in the future, we will receive what the Jews will receive in the future.</P><P>We can see clearly that the time for realizing the new covenant is in the future at the beginning of the millennium. Through the Lord Jesus' death for us, we now have a foretaste of the blessing of the new covenant. There is no doubt about this. We need to pay attention to what the new covenant is. From the time God spoke about enacting the new covenant through Jeremiah to the time the Lord Jesus established the new covenant, how many years were there? The time span was very long; it was a few hundred years. During these few hundred years, the new covenant was just dead letters. It is a pity that many Jews did not receive the blessing of the new covenant. Although God's covenant was written out, placed before them, and they had read about God's making a new covenant with the people of Israel, they did not know how they could obtain this new covenant, nor did they receive the blessings of the new covenant. Thank the Lord that He did not mention a covenant throughout most of His lifetime. He did not speak of a covenant. All He did was cast out demons, heal the sick, feed men by multiplying loaves, and preach the gospel. Our Lord worked quietly, day after day and year after year. Then one night, when He was alone with a few disciples at dinner, He suddenly brought up a covenant which was very old, buried, concealed, and completely forgotten, but was still very precious, reliable, and signed. It was a covenant that had never been used or claimed by anyone. Suddenly the Lord declared that the cup was His blood, which was shed for the new covenant. From the time He came to the earth to the time He died, the central thought occupying the Lord Jesus was enacting the covenant. But until that night He had not explicitly mentioned that He was going to fulfill this covenant. He said then that the blood He was to shed was for the enactment of the new covenant.</P><P>Today man has forgotten the full gospel. Most people say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to redeem man from sin. Truly, the blood of the Lord was shed for redemption. But at the same time, it was also shed for the enactment of the new covenant. If the Lord had not died and His blood had not been shed, the new covenant would not have been accomplished, and God could not have made a covenant with us. Truly, the Lord shed His blood for redemption. But redemption is not the final goal of the shedding of His blood. Redemption is only a means and a way to reach the final goal. The final goal is the enactment of the new covenant and the bestowal of the blessing of the new covenant on us. Our sins are forgiven through the blood of the Lord, but the purpose of His shedding the blood was for the enactment of the new covenant. We know that without the shedding of blood, there is no redemption. Hebrews 9:22 says that without shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. Redemption and the enactment of the covenant are very intimate and closely related. However, there is a distinction between the two. Brothers and sisters, please remember that God made a covenant to give us knowledge, life, and power. Because our sins are not yet cleansed, we do not receive them. Sin lies between us and God, and separates us from the knowledge, life, and power that God wants to give us. All of our sins before God must be removed. The way to remove the sins before God is not by our work, merit, or future improvement. If our sins are not dealt with and removed before God, He cannot forgive our sins. Thank the Lord that He has been crucified for our sins; He has shed His blood, has resurrected from the tomb, and ascended to God. God is fully satisfied in His death and resurrection. Therefore, He must forgive us.</P>
