   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Discipline Jacob Experienced in Haran</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 29 tells us that Jacob went to the land of the people of the east and saw the shepherds who came from Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he met God on his way, he worried about food and raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he had reached the land of the east and met his relatives, the first thing he did was weep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This weeping tells us what he experienced on his way and what he expected to face in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A scheming and calculating man usually does not weep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He weeps only when he finds that he cannot do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jacob wept at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God was also ready to begin another work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he arrived at his uncle Laban's house, his uncle said to him, "Surely thou art my bone and my flesh," and Jacob abode with him for a month v. 14 . After being a guest of his uncle for a month, his uncle said in a seemingly polite way, "Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?" v. 15 . From this word we see that Laban's mind was also the mind of a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He and Jacob turned out to be the same kind of person!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Esau was with Jacob, he could not deal with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when Jacob met Laban, Jacob found it hard to deal with Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A quick-tempered person may often come across another quick-tempered person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A stingy person may often come across another stingy person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A proud person may often come across another proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person who likes to take advantage of others may often come across another person who equally likes to take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are all thorny trials.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was what Jacob was faced with at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's discipline put him before a man like Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apparently this word sounded nice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, Laban was saying that Jacob should not eat his food for free, that he should work a little, and that he would be given a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Laban was only putting it in a nice way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past, Jacob was a son at home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now he had to be a hired worker!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was God's discipline through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He served Laban, and the payment he wanted was Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For Rachel's sake, he served Laban seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the end he was cheated by Laban and was given Leah instead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly he deceived others; now he was deceived!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So he served Laban seven more years for the sake of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During those fourteen years, he served his uncle for the sake of Laban's two daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In all he served his uncle for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this time, his uncle deceived him and changed his wages ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Originally it was agreed that he would get a certain sum of money after he finished his work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after the work was finished, he was told that something was wrong, and his wages were changed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the average, this was one change every two years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jacob was indeed being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But thank the Lord that this was God's hand upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Bethel God said that He would bring him back to the land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God promised that he would return.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before that, however, He first wanted him to know God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God was holding Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He put Jacob in the house of Laban, a man who was as crafty, clever, and shrewd as he was, so that Jacob would be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During this period, Jacob began to learn to submit under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this does not mean that Jacob as a person had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jacob still devised methods to make the lambs spotted and speckled so that they would become his.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jacob was still the same old Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even Laban could not deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though Laban changed his wages ten times, Jacob still had the way to come out ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God had a purpose in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to fulfill His purpose, God disciplined him in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wanted to deal with his strong points.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was God's work which He wanted to accomplish in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He dealt with Jacob step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For twenty years Jacob was repeatedly wounded and he repeatedly suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, God was working in him to discipline him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the other hand, his flesh was still present, and he was as cunning and crafty as before.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, God did not give up working on him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through all of his adverse circumstances, he eventually came to acknowledge God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob thought about returning home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But his days of discipline were not yet fulfilled, and he still had to submit under the hand of Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He could not leave one day too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should believe that everything that passes through God's hand is good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our circumstances are arranged by God and are there for our benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every environmental arrangement is for our benefit; it deals with the strong points in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We hope that God will not need to use twenty years to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But unfortunately, some people do not learn the lesson even after twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although some people have been tested and disciplined, they never advance; it is a pity that their flesh is never touched or weakened, and they are still scheming and supplanting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, we should not complain that God's hand is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Originally, Jacob was a merciless person, but after he was disciplined by God, he became a kind and loving person in his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May we see that all our experiences in our environments are measured one by one by the Holy Spirit according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No experience comes to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All the experiences we encounter are arranged by the Holy Spirit and are there to edify us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>While we are passing through these disciplines and trials, we may not feel joyful or comfortable, but they are all part of God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Afterwards, we will realize that these experiences were all for our benefit.</S>
