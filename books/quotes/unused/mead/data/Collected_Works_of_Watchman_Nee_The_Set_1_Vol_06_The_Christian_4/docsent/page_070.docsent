   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE ELEVEN ESSENTIALS AND NONESSENTIALS Issue No. 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How do we differentiate between essentials and nonessentials?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often hear God's children say that such and such a teaching in the Bible is essential, and such and such a teaching is nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How do we differentiate between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What are essential teachings, and what are nonessential teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we exercise careful observation, we will find many who consider that questions related to their own salvation are essential teachings and questions unrelated to their salvation are nonessential teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we often hear people say, "Do I have to obey the Lord in this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not think this matter is essential because it is not related to my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even more foolish Christians will ask, "Does this matter have to do with my salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it has to do with my salvation, I will obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If not, what difference will it make if I do not obey it?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am saved already!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me ask once more: what is essential and what is nonessential?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may answer, "The essentials are teachings that have to do with the salvation of the saints, and the nonessentials are teachings concerning God's commandments and His glory!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The commandments and glory of God are nonessential because they have nothing to do with the saints' going to heaven and receiving eternal life!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that something is merely a commandment of God and merely related to God's glory is not enough to motivate the saints to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a pity that this is the condition of many people today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints will only obey and submit if they consider that keeping all of the commandments and obeying all of God's will is necessary in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has said that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life; therefore, since they have believed and received eternal life, believers think that there is no further need to be concerned with God's other commandments and will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Other than the questions of heaven and hell, nothing moves the saints' hearts anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even God's own glory is something minor to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless God makes all of His commandments as conditions for salvation, He cannot expect some saints to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because all they hope and plan for is receiving eternal life and going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Pleasing God and submitting to His will are peripheral issues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How pitiful is this situation!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The saints today are most selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing can attract their attention except those things that have to do with their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is this the standard that God requires?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wants us to obey Him willingly and not by force.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He loves to bestow grace to us and give us eternal life once we believe in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unlike the time of the law, He has not made His commandments as conditions for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unfortunately, believers are not willing to be obedient children and walk according to the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, they ask, "Is this something essential, or is it something nonessential?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We admit that with biblical teachings, some are more important, while others are less important.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we do not agree that there are essential and nonessential biblical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Would God be so uneconomical as to put meaningless and nonessential teachings, commandments, and doctrines into the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should know better than we do!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The present question is not whether or not a biblical teaching is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it is included in the Bible, it surely is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The question is whether or not the saints will honor God's glory and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we consider the Lord Jesus' conduct on earth, our mouths will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no need for Him to consider the question of His own salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then according to the principle of men today, nothing about Him would have been essential because He did not need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But how He obeyed God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even in the smallest matter, He fulfilled all righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was not like men today who scrupulously bargain with God in questions beyond their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is yet another distinction between essential and nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a personal distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The things that a saint obeys, he considers as essential; the things that he has not followed, but rather disobeyed God in, he considers as nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The difference between essential and nonessential does not lie in the fact that the Bible has said it, but rather in one's own view.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because one has obeyed in a certain matter, he considers the teaching he has obeyed as essential and draws back from other teachings which he has not obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Alas, now is the time for God's children to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now is the time for us to be revived to obey God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we pay close attention to God's glory and truly care for His will in the same way that Paul declared "all the counsel of God."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we not separate God's Bible into essential and nonessential parts according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to realize that obeying in big matters is indeed obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But obeying in small matters is also obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Disobeying in big matters is disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is disobedience in small matters not also disobedience?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we walk according to the teaching of the Bible and take God's glory as our goal in everything that we do in our lives, whether great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One cannot say that eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But since God forbade man to do it, eating of the tree became the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One little sin drove Adam from the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Was Achan's sin a great one?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What he stole was probably not worth that much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But since he disobeyed God, he was punished.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why did Saul lose his kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not commit a terrifying sin; he only disobeyed God in a little thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Did Moses commit a great sin when he was barred from entering Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible says that he was the most humble person on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why did he suffer such punishment from God?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It was only because of a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God told him to command the rock to flow out water, yet he hit the rock twice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Humanly speaking, what kind of sin can this be considered?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In men's eyes today, such a matter would be considered nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But God never considers any of His commandments to be nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May we henceforth obey God more and more!</S>
