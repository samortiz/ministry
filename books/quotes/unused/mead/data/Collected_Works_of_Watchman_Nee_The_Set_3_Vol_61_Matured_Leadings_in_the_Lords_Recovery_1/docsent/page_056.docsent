   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Miss Lei</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are a few items which you have handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition you have two rings and a lapel pin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is good that you have handed over your jewelry, but take care that you do not buy any more again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Christian should not have any gold or silver, except that used for dental fillings of his teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He should be like Peter, who said that we should not have for our adorning any jewelry, but should have instead for adornment a meek and quiet spirit 1 Pet 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Principle of Selling or Giving Away</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Offered Goods</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle the church exercises concerning consecrated items is to return them to you for you to sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church will not do the selling and giving away for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because the church wants to stay away from criticism or slander.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church can find a place for you to sell your things, or it can inform you where there are needs and who has needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the church will not do the selling or giving away for you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to do the selling and giving away yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I return to you the things and ask you to sell them yourself, I am showing you where the things have gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to prevent Satan from bothering you or lying to you one day by giving you the thought that the church has cheated you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said that we should exercise foresight for what is honorable in the sight of man 2 Cor 8:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that we will all be clear about this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Sun</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mr. Sun is also here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Sun has given a short testimony concerning how the Lord led him to hand over himself the first and second time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first time was in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day a certain Brother Hsieh asked him, "Shanghai is having a revival because all the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What would you say to that?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time he felt that those engaged in business could never be ready for the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It so happened that, during that period of time, there was a seven-day conference in Foochow, and the truth and practice of handing oneself over was released.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second night he stood up and declared that he would sell everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank God it has been two years since he made that commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He testified that because of that first consecration, the Lord began a revival in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, in his escape from the war, he was enlightened a second time on his journey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He confessed his sin on a ship, saying, "Lord, I have not been faithful in the service of Your house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I still have many possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time, the ships in front of and behind him were bombed, and between one hundred to two hundred people were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet he was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He had thought of escaping to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in order to avoid further bombing, he decided to change his course and come to Hong Kong instead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now he has a car shop.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is willing to hand himself over once more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has forty bicycles, forty-five tires, twenty rolls of fabric, two pieces of land in Nanping, and ten cars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition, he has thirty-five cars and two taels of gold in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He wants to hand over all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that in principle all these things need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a Christian has a piece of land or a shop, it is best that he does not rent it out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two pieces of land in Nanping can be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The golden necklace and the rings can also be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the principle of the Bible, we should not have any silver or gold Acts 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As for your trading business, after some time you can join the brothers in Fukien and go into a trading business together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But time does not allow us to be in trading for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Lord is willing, you can try to start some small manufacturing business.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Christian should earn by producing something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not want us to be in the employment of pure trading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul made tents; he did not engage himself in wholesale tent trading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pure commerce easily corrupts Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that you will stay away from pure commerce, and involve yourself in some form of production instead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A COVENANT OF CAREFUL SPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is another thing of which I would like to remind the brothers who are in business.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe we should learn from John Wesley, who had a holy, secret covenant with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Between you and God there should be a careful pact as to how much you can spend.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A Christian's spending habit should be according to God's measure of spending.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To increase spending based on increased income is not the Christian way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church does not want to say anything about a man's standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It will not decide what this secret covenant between you and God should be.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not an extreme person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not want to say any extreme things, but presently, in the midst of all the turmoil of war, many people do not have enough to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can we live peacefully in excess?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This corrupts Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Between us and God there should be a crucial and secret covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This will limit us from careless spending.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will not dare to buy anything capriciously.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>John Wesley kept his secret covenant with the Lord all his years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As soon as his spending reached a certain point, he would freeze his spending.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the brothers in business should learn to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They should say, "My standard of living will only go up to a certain point, after which I will have to freeze it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I will only allow it to reach that point, beyond which I will not do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people will have to make this decision before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether the standard should be higher or lower should be decided by each individual's amount of consecration before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not compare yourself with others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But do not set the standard too low, unless that is a standard with which God has enlightened you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Always follow the Lord's leading, not your own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once you have made the decision, do your best to abide by that secret covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You should abide by it for ten years, twenty years, or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way we can give away everything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The brothers and sisters who are in school should decide for themselves how much they should spend a month on miscellaneous items.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They do not have to let their parents know about this amount.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If their parents give them more, they can offer it up for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are things that they have control over and that occupy their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They should select one or two cherished items of these things and give these away.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In this way they will learn not to love mammon and the things of this world.</S>
