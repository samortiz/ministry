   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b A Shameful Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After receiving the gifts from Abimelech, Abraham prayed for him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abimelech needed Abraham's intercession because the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you think that you would be able to pray in such a shameful situation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abimelech might have said to Abraham, "Why did you, a prophet of God, lie to me?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Look at what has happened!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now that everything has been settled and I have returned your wife, I want you to pray for me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times, after we have failed the Lord, we are unable to pray for days, even though no one knows about our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How much more difficult it was for Abraham to pray in the presence of Abimelech!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, Abraham prayed, and "God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children" v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to intercede for Abimelech, Abraham had to overcome two things: his memory of his failure before Abimelech and his consideration of his wife's barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had to forget his failure before Abimelech and not consider his wife's barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I had been Abraham, I would have said, "I'm sorry, Abimelech, but I have failed the Lord and now I don't have the faith to pray for you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must learn that interceding for others does not depend upon our success; it depends upon the need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a need has been designated by God, we must intercede for it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abraham might have said to the Lord, "I have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I lied to Abimelech and he has rebuked me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can I intercede for him?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we intercede for others, we must forget about ourselves, our surroundings, and our circumstances and intercede as if there were no one on earth except us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In spite of our failures, we must exercise our spirit and pray with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although God was forced to leave Abraham and go to Abimelech, Abraham was higher than Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although he had failed, Abimelech was far below him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that the greater always blesses the lesser Heb 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because Abraham was higher than Abimelech, he could intercede for him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, we should not think that because God has not answered our prayers for our own needs we cannot pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I had been Abraham, I might have said, "Abimelech, you ask me to pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been praying for my wife for years without receiving an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this, I'm not sure that God will answer my prayer for you and I don't have the boldness to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to forget about our unanswered prayers and pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would not pray for others, God will probably not answer our prayers for our own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not say that since your own need has not been met, you cannot pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Abraham forgot his need and interceded for Abimelech and his house, not only were their needs met but also his.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you forget your need and pray for the needs of others, God will not only answer your prayer for them but also your prayer for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will take care of your needs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham's intercession for Abimelech was a shameful one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such a shameful situation it is difficult for anyone to intercede.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible does not give us a full record of Abraham's intercession for Abimelech like it does of his intercession for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps Abraham was not bold or strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, he interceded for Abimelech and his prayer was answered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this we see that although we may not be bold in our spirit, as long as we intercede for others according to God's designation, our intercession will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can testify to this from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A number of times I was in difficulty and prayed about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I received no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suddenly people came to me who had the same difficulty and asked me to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After I prayed for them, God not only answered my prayer for their need but also my prayer for my own situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all must learn not to pray according to our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is easy to pray after we have been victorious, but not after we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although I do not encourage anyone to fail, I do say that we should not be bothered by our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God does not count on our failures; He counts on what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the presence of God, we are the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what we are, and we must pray according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because we are still in this old creation, we may fall back and fail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we can forget that failure in the old creation and stand upon our position in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Abraham stood on his position of being God's prophet, he could pray for Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genesis 20 is a very dear chapter, and we need to spend time to consider all its main points: the hidden weakness of God's seeking one; the way he was rebuked by Abimelech and was temporarily set aside by God; his intercession for Abimelech and his family; and the way God answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you dwell on this chapter for a few hours, your spirit will be richly nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As I consider this chapter today, I find it more needful than chapter eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although chapter eighteen is sweet, chapter twenty is precious, teaching us some precious lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It teaches us that interceding for others does not depend upon our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It depends upon our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It depends upon who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are the prophet of God, the new creation, the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Being in the church life as a member of the Body of Christ gives us the standing to intercede for others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Forget about your environment and your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you hold on to your feelings, your mouth will be shut, Satan will be victorious over you, and you will be deadened for days.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must forget our failures and our needs and take the proper standing to intercede for others according to God's designation and believe in God for others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We also must learn to know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not think that if you have attainments as high as those recorded in Genesis 18 and 19, you will have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot afford to take a vacation from our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not have any confidence in your old self.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although your old self has been dealt with by God, it is still untrustworthy, even if it has been fully circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether we are aware of it or not, deep within us there is a certain reservation in following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One day this reservation, this reserve of our natural weakness, will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not be surprised when it happens.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Be prepared to take grace, forget your failures and your needs, and intercede for others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Stand on your position as a member of the Body of Christ, as a part of the new man, and as a saint in the Lord's recovery and pray, even if you pray with a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Your intercession may be shameful and there may be no glory in it, but God will still answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Along with His answer to your shameful intercession, He will also answer your previously unanswered prayers for your own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When, as God's prophet, Abraham lied to others, they became deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But when he forgot his failure before them and interceded for them, they received life and he himself was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Likewise, if we forget our failures and intercede for the needs of those before whom we have failed, we shall not only minister life to them but also to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May we all learn the lessons contained in this chapter.</S>
