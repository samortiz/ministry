   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST S HEAVENLINESS, KINGLINESS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having seen how the gold and the linen are woven together through a process involving suffering, let us now go on to consider the colors of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The color blue signifies Christ s heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brown, by contrast, is the color of things earthy or dusty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Christ there is nothing brown.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Him everything is blue, heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Purple signifies the kingliness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In all He did the Lord Jesus was kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even as a child growing up in the home of a carpenter, He conducted Himself in a kingly way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you read the account of the way He spoke to His parents when He was twelve, you will realize that He spoke to them in a kingly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even as a small boy of twelve, He could act and speak with kingliness Luke 2:46-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read through the four Gospels again, you will see that in everything He said the Lord was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not assume His kingship; it was manifested spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We in our natural life certainly are not heavenly or kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of expressing blue, we express brown, the color of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, instead of conducting ourselves like kings, we may act in a way that is very low.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we lose our temper, we may be scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even when we are happy, we still may not have the Lord s kingly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when the Lord Jesus became angry with those in the temple and made a whip of cords to drive them out, He was angry in a kingly way John 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, when He wept at the tomb of Lazarus, He did so with kingliness John 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even in His weeping, the Lord s kingship was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Scarlet signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout His life on earth, the Lord Jesus acted in a redemptive way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, He manifested the color red, the color of redemption, when He said to His disciples concerning the multitude, Give them something to eat Matt 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord did not want to see the people go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also, when the Lord Jesus healed the woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years and was bound by Satan, He was acting in the way of redemption Luke 13:11-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To those who criticized Him concerning this, He said that He did not want this woman to be bound by Satan any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Along with the colors blue, purple, and scarlet, we have golden yellow and pure white.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Golden yellow signifies the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand with two loaves and five fishes, God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The golden yellow color shone forth from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, when He was angry and cleansed the temple, He manifested both His kingliness and the golden yellow of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, on that occasion the pure linen, signifying the expression of Christ s humanity, could also be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both God and man, divinity and humanity, were manifested in the life of the Lord Jesus on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the living of this Man we can see heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can see the divine brightness and also a pure humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the living of the Lord Jesus we see all these colors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TREASURING THE PICTURE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Can you point to a chapter of the New Testament that portrays the Lord Jesus in the way He is portrayed in the ephod?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no such chapter in the New Testament, for this kind of description cannot be put into words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It can only be presented by a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is it possible to describe adequately in words a person s face?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may take a thousand words to describe someone s nose or ear, and still your description would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But a picture would be better than thousands of words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason I treasure the picture of Christ in Exodus 28.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a sad thing that for centuries Christians, including those who love the Lord and seek Him, have not paid adequate attention to the portrait of Christ in Exodus 28.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, their appreciation of the Lord has not been sufficiently high.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can testify that by considering this picture, I appreciate the Lord much more, and out of my appreciation I have given Him new worship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have said, Lord, I see You in this picture, and I appreciate You.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I cannot put into words what I see and appreciate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, here in Exodus 28 I see You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank You, Lord, for this picture of Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are the ephod woven with gold and linen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your divinity and humanity are together in Your one Person, yet the nature of divinity and humanity remain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are not lost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, I praise You for the wonderful Person You are!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We thank the Lord for the marvelous picture of the ephod with all the beautiful colors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These colors, the colors of the rainbow, are the most beautiful colors in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What colors are more beautiful than the five colors of the ephod?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not believe you can find colors more beautiful than these, for these colors are in a textile signifying the expression of the Lord s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have not interpreted the picture in Exodus 28 according to my natural cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, I am not the one who painted this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, I have received the mercy from the Lord to understand it to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here in Exodus 28 we have a picture showing us that there is a fabric in this universe woven with golden and linen thread and containing the five colors of golden yellow, pure white, blue, purple, and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the ephod that the Lord Jesus is wearing today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is still clad in a garment made of gold and linen and with five beautiful colors expressing His divinity, humanity, heavenliness, kingliness, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How marvelous!</S>
