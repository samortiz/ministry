Everyone Left from All the Nations<br>That Went Forth against Jerusalem<br>Going Up from Year to Year<br>to Worship the King, Jehovah of Hosts,<br>and to Keep the Feast of Tabernacles</H2><P>Everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles (v. 16).
