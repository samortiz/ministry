   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Consummated and Consummating Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the divine Spirit is the consummated and consummating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All that the Triune God is, has gone through, has accomplished, and has attained and obtained is consummated in this consummating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the reality; therefore, in the New Testament the Spirit is also the reality John 14:17a; 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have the Spirit, you have incarnation, the incarnated God, the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you have this Spirit, you have the very humanity of the Lord with His divinity, and you even have His very human living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have this Spirit, you have the reality of the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have this Spirit, you have the reality of the resurrection, which is the unique power in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The power of the resurrection of Christ is altogether realized, wrapped up, and embodied in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have this Spirit, you are in the heavens because the ascension of Christ is wrapped up with and one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have the Spirit and if you are in the Spirit, you are in the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are one with this Christ because you have the reality which is the very consummated and consummating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must have this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not merely bring a doctrine to the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to bring the very Triune God as the reality, which is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you speak, you must have the assurance that you are passing on, that you are dispensing, some amount of this reality to people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Contacting, Living, and Speaking Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The dispensing does not depend on our eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to look to the Lord and pray much for eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to fellowship with Him, to have a good beginning of every day by contacting Him, by being revived again in the morning and being exposed in His very presence, by being enlightened, by being put in His divine light, and by seeing all our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if we did this yesterday, we still need to do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every morning we need to wash.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we washed thoroughly yesterday, that does not mean that today we do not need to wash again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day we need to have a good start of the day by contacting God to have a renewed revival and to receive enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not hide any shortage or any part of our person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to cooperate with the divine life to be fully exposed and fully dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will receive a thorough cleansing, and our day will have a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the whole day you must live in this Triune God, and you must live the very embodiment of this Triune God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must learn to say as Paul did, For to me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then speak Christ in any place, in season or out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there are no humans, speak to the birds and animals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Speak Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No humans may be listening, but be assured that the demons are present.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will hear your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The good and evil angels are also present.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a spiritual battle, and we must testify to the entire universe that we are such persons living Christ and speaking Christ all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not persons living for the world; we are not persons living for our interests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are persons living Christ and living to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are such persons day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the evening we may go to meet with our dear fellow-believers, either our family in our own home, our neighbors, or our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may go to a big meeting or a small meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may go to a home meeting, a group meeting, or a larger church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In any case, the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherever we are, we should be persons speaking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not preach a doctrine concerning truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Go to impart the Triune God to people, to dispense the very Christ, even in a fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then you will have the truth with the very divine life backing it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Truth without the reality of life falls into doctrine of letters, and it forms deadening regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a solemn warning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not go anywhere to merely preach doctrine as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is not truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not preach empty doctrine, but impart the living Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Dispense the very Christ you have experienced in a very fine way in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are such a person, you are fully qualified to tell others what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, it is advisable not to speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not merely tell others what you have heard in messages as doctrines without reality and the supply of life.</S>
