   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Necessities</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is difficult to grasp the real meaning of the word rendered necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Darby in his translation also uses the word necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Chinese version uses the word poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we are in want, short of food, lodging, or clothing, we are in necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 12:10, where the same Greek word is used, the Chinese version uses a word meaning straits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word means constraints, urgent needs that press heavily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It refers to sufferings that result from calamities and straits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An example of calamity would be the eruption of Mount Saint Helens some time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was a calamity to those in the vicinity of the volcano.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The result of such a calamity is want, shortage of daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul passed through many calamities and straits and, as a result, was in necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today Christians evaluate one who is a servant of God not by his experience in necessities but by his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If someone possesses great riches, he is considered blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if a believer becomes poor, lacking in food, housing, clothing, or other necessities for daily living, many would say of him, This brother is not approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God is not happy with him or pleased with him, He does not bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What, then, about Paul, who was in necessities?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely he was approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not think that riches are a sign that we are blessed by the Lord or approved by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, it may be that want, necessity, and poverty are the true qualifications of a minister of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Distresses</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 4 Paul also speaks of distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Literally the Greek word rendered distresses means narrowness of room; hence, straits, difficulties, distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not easy to explain the difference between afflictions and distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some translators even reverse the order of these words in verse 4, using distresses for afflictions, and afflictions for distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that distresses are the inward sufferings which come as a reaction to the outward afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the various words Paul uses in verse 4 we know that he was in different kinds of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse clearly indicates that Paul s life was a life of affliction, calamity, straits, necessities, and distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you like to hear about this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you still want to be a minister of the new covenant when you hear about Paul s difficulties and troubles?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today many young men are encouraged to be ministerial students.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After graduating from a seminary, they may find a good job as a pastor or minister.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may be provided housing and an adequate salary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul, however, was not that kind of minister, and he did not live that kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, his life, the life that qualified him to be a new covenant minister, was a life of endurance, affliction, necessities, and distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Stripes</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 5 says, In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The stripes refer to the beatings Paul received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 11:23 he refers to stripes excessively, where the word excessively literally means above measure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 11:24 Paul says, From the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, according to Acts 16:23, in Philippi Paul and Silas had many stripes laid upon them and then were cast into prison Acts 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Imprisonments</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 11:23 Paul speaks of imprisonments more abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Several times Paul was cast into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have already referred to the occasion at Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Ephesians 3:1 Paul refers to himself as the prisoner of Christ Jesus, and in Ephesians 4:1, as the prisoner in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Again, in 2 Timothy 1:8 and Philemon 9 and 23 Paul refers to imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Tumults</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Tumults refer to rebellions, revolts, and great disturbances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Acts 17:5 describes one such tumult.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acts 19 describes a great tumult which occurred in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 23 of that chapter says, There arose no small stir about that way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Labors</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 2 Corinthians 11:23 Paul says that he was in labors more abundantly, and in verse 27, speaks of in labor and hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul mentions this in 1 Thessalonians 2:9: For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working night and day so as not to be burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He refers to this again in 2 Thessalonians 3:8, where he says, Nor did we eat bread as a gift from anyone, but in labor and hardship we worked night and day that we might not be burdensome to any of you.</S>
