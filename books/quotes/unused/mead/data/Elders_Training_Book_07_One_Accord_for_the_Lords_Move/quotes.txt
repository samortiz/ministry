[1]  Elders Training, Book 07: One Accord for the Lord s Move CONTENTS
[2]  Book 7 entitled One Accord for the Lord s Move and Book 8 entitled The Life-Pulse of the Lord s Present Move contain Brother Lee s fellowship during those days.
[3]  Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.

[5]  thumos, mind, will, purpose soul, heart Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom 15:6; 12:16; 1 Cor 1:10; 2 Cor 13:11; Phil 1:27; 2:2; 4:2 A TRAINING OF PRACTICES
[6]  Throughout our history in the Lord s recovery, all of our practices have been according to what we have seen of the Lord s revelation, of the heavenly vision.
[7]  The practice in the Lord s recovery beginning from October of 1984 and starting in Taiwan was something absolutely new.
[8]  I do not like to see the dear saints from the United States going to Taiwan to see something and then coming back to the United States to merely imitate or copy it.
[9]  This will not work and may even damage the situation because you probably are not so clear about the Lord s doing.
[10]  I would not say you should not practice the home gatherings, but I do not believe that to merely copy or imitate would help you.
[11]  If you mean business with the Lord s recovery and if you mean business with His present day, up-to-date move, you must first take care of this one thing one accord.
[12]  I spent much time to consider whether it is not beyond the teaching of the Scriptures for the church to use a church meeting hall and church personnel to open a school rather than to use our time to contact people one on one with prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, using every inch of the meeting hall in this way for the gospel.
[13]  The Lord s recovery in mainland China started in 1922.
[14]  I was with Brother Nee until I left for Taiwan in 1949.
[15]  Throughout those twenty-seven years Brother Nee was always under a suffering due to the fact that there were saints, co-workers, and elders receiving his ministry, yet it was hard to see that they were one.
[16]  When I came into the Lord s recovery in 1932, I saw how Brother Nee suffered because of this, but up to 1942 and 1943 by the Lord s mercy a great revival was taking place in Chefoo through the one accord among the serving ones there.
[17]  IN THE RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 1:8; 4:31; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20
[18]  The book of Acts begins with the one accord and stresses the one accord.
[19]  The early disciples could not have maintained or kept this one accord, however, if they had had different ways, means, agents, or substances for them to carry out the Lord s move on this earth.
[20]  If we read through the entire book of Acts, we can see that the way they took to carry out God s move on this earth to fulfill His New Testament economy was entirely by three main substances prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.
[21]  Not only in Acts but also throughout the entire New Testament, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word were used for the carrying out of God s economy.
[22]  Chapter six is the end of the first section where it says the word of God grew v. 7 . Chapter twelve is the end of the second section and tells us that the word of God grew and multiplied v. 24 . Then Paul s ministry began in chapter thirteen.
[23]  Finally, chapter nineteen is the end of another section, telling us that the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong v. 20 . The Lord s move eventually is not to have something resulting in the Spirit.
[24]  By going out to the small villages, they baptized one thousand nine hundred seventy-five within three weeks.
[25]  Instead of using our hall to establish a school or as some kind of center to take care of children, we need to spend our time on the Word and to contact people.
[26]  INTO THE LIGHT AND BEING DEALT WITH BY HIM
[27]  If you are going to be a prevailing one, you need to go to the Lord every day to get yourself adjusted, cleansed, enlightened, exposed, and rebuked, not by man s words but by the Lord s Spirit directly.
[28]  TEACHING 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; 16:1; Acts 2:42; Rom 16:17; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; Eph 4:13-14
[29]  I like to classify the work on the doctrinal side because through my continuous observation I have discovered that few among us would dare to say that they are doing a work separate from the unique work for the Lord s recovery.
[30]  We all agree with this sevenfold oneness doctrinally concerning the one God, the one Lord, the one Spirit, the one church, the one recovery, and the one work.
[31]  At that time, I was giving a message on John 2 where the Lord told the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up v. 19 . I told the saints that if this is my work it has to be torn down, but if this is the work of the Lord you cannot tear it down.
[32]  First Corinthians 4:17, 7:17 and 16:1 indicates that Paul taught all the churches the same thing.
[33]  All the churches were under one teaching, the teaching of the apostles Acts 2:42 .
[34]  It is in this final book that the Lord through John testifies concerning the words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book" Rev 22:18-19 .
[35]  Paul instructed the church in Corinth to do what he had directed the churches of Galatia to do 1 Cor 16:1 , so all the churches under Paul s ministry were one in the apostles teaching Acts 2:42 .
[36]  There are two portions in 1 Corinthians concerning head covering and concerning women s ministry which show us that we need to be one in practice.
[37]  There were many different thoughts concerning the matter of head covering, but Paul told the saints in 11:16 not to be contentious concerning this: But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
[38]  TO BE IDENTICAL The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches Rev 2:1, 7 seven times The solution made at Jerusalem was the decree for all the churches to keep Acts 15:1-2, 13, 19-21, 22-23, 25-31; 16:4-5 The apostle s epistle to the Colossians was charged to be read by the Laodiceans, and the epistle to the Laodiceans to be read by the Colossians Col 4:16 The Gentile churches became imitators of the churches in Judea 1 Thes 2:14a
[39]  The points listed above are not my teaching but the teaching of the Bible in the New Testament, the teaching of God s New Testament economy.
[40]  My fellowship with you all is constituted with four things: 1 a lifelong study of the Bible for over sixty-one years; 2 a lifelong study of the biographies of spiritual giants that the Lord has raised up through all the centuries; 3 the history of the church including the raising up and the founders of different denominations, including the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant the state churches, private churches and the free groups; 4 my observation of the situation in the Lord s recovery, in which I have been for over fifty-four years.
[41]  I would eventually like to fellowship four things with you which have been on my heart for a long time: the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel in the unique, harmonious way see Book 8 in this series .
[42]  When I entered into the recovery and was asked by Brother Nee, the leader in the Lord s recovery, to join the work, I spent much time to consider whether I should enter into the work.
[43]  The fact that the word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit not only indicates that He and the Spirit are one, but also that His word spoken to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches.
[44]  A wife could say to her husband, I love you and I take you as my husband, but whatever you say I have to bring to the Lord to see if it is really His leading for me.
[45]  The best church was Philadelphia, but even Philadelphia did not consider that she had to pray to seek the Lord s leading as to whether she should take the Lord s word to the other churches wholly or partially and as to whether it fit into her local situation.
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE THE LEADING OF THE APOSTLES According to the teaching of God s New Testament economy John 14:25-26; 16:12-15; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; Col 1:25 Not to practice what is beyond the Scripture s teaching 1 Cor 4:6 Teach what the apostle teaches 2 Tim 2:2, 15 Be imitators of the apostle who is the imitator of Christ 1 Cor 11:1
[47]  The four items in chapter four should be followed by the four items listed above.
[48]  I have quoted many verses to prove to you and to confirm to you that the need of all the churches to be identical is the truth according to God s New Testament economy.
[49]  According to the Bible there is only one factor the leading one is the one who leads the Lord s people according to the teaching of God s New Testament economy.
[50]  The teaching of the apostles denotes the entire revelation of God s New Testament economy, and this entire revelation of God s New Testament economy is something absolutely missed by most Christians.
[51]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 is an application of the fulfillment of the Lord s word in John 16:14-15.
[52]  To say that there are two lines in the Lord s recovery is to go beyond the teaching of the New Testament.
[53]  If you stress speaking in tongues above the central line of God s New Testament economy, you are off.
[54]  They have nothing to do with the Lord s headship or with the Lord s redemptive work.
[55]  Although I gave such a serious word that my toleration is over, some brothers may feel, not in a negative way, but in a very positive way concerning me, that they love me and do not think that I need to be that serious about little things such as these.
[56]  Let us read 1 Corinthians 14:6-8 to see the context of this illustration: But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?
[57]  Since October of 1984 I felt greatly burdened for the Lord s move on this earth, and I felt very clearly that the Lord was leading me to go back to Taiwan.
[58]  I was so clear that we needed to have a new start in the Lord s recovery.
[59]  In these fifteen years in South America, in Central America, in Africa, in Europe, and in Australasia more localities have been taken by the Lord s recovery, but the total number in the Lord s recovery is too small.
[60]  The title of this message does not say no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord s recovery but in the Lord s ministry.
[61]  I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord s wisdom.
[62]  By the Lord s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise.
[63]  It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time.
[64]  After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord s work, yet I would be asked to go out.
[65]  AND THE BUILDING OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:3-23 A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[66]  After fellowshipping in the last chapter concerning the uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord s ministry, which refers to the army fighting the battle, I would like to fellowship in this chapter concerning the wise master builder and the building of God.
[67]  To partake of the Lord s table in an improper manner is to destroy the temple because the Body that we partake of at the Lord s table signifies God s building.
[68]  When you come to the Lord s table, you touch the Lord s Body, the mystical Body of Christ, which is the temple of God.
[69]  The Brethren opposed the truth concerning the discipline of the coming age.
[70]  But when I was with them, they always warned us to be careful in our Christian conduct; otherwise, God would discipline or chastise us.
[71]  Later I was enlightened to see that God s chastisement is not only in this age but even more in the coming age.
[72]  I want to get into all these points contained in this book to make the truth so bright in the Lord s recovery.
[73]  I am also careful not to damage or destroy Christ s Body; otherwise, I will suffer destruction because the church, Christ s Body and God s temple, is a treasure so dear and precious to Him, purchased with His own blood Acts 20:28 .
[74]  If you were such a person, the Lord would probably assign a portion to you that you might be qualified and able to be a designer because you know His concepts, His heart s desire, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, His good pleasure.
[75]  Christianity has delayed the Lord and missed the mark for centuries, but in the Lord s recovery the one thing, the unique thing, the Lord has been showing us is the New Testament economy of God.
[76]  CHAPTER EIGHT ONE ACCORD IN THE LORD S MOVE Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:32; Rom 15:5-6; 1 Cor 1:10; Phil 1:27; 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:15; Rev 1:4-5a
[77]  The one accord is the base, the ground, for our present practice in the Lord s move.
[78]  Anything that we do, teach, or practice must be absolutely according to the holy Word, which is God s completed revelation.
[79]  The very great, particular characteristic in the Lord s recovery is to do everything according to the Bible.
[80]  The matter of being in one accord in the New Testament occupies a very crucial stand for the Lord s move.
[81]  The Spirit, who is the biggest factor in the Lord s move in the New Testament today, after the Lord s ascension, is the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[82]  Through His brooding the creation in God s plan was brought in. In the Old Testament the Spirit was very much involved with God s old creation.
[83]  If you expect to have one accord in any kind of society, group, or movement, you need the same kind of thinking that comes out of the same kind of knowledge.
[84]  Therefore, Acts tells us that on the one hand, there was one accord among the disciples, and on the other hand, all those who were one in one accord were continuing in the teaching of the apostles 2:42 .
[85]  Paul s Leadership in Acts 13 28 The Problem with Barnabas
[86]  In the last section of Acts all the churches acted and moved according to Paul s teaching.
[87]  When Paul began his ministry, he was the youngest one among the apostles.
[88]  Barnabas was the brother who brought Paul into practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem Acts 9:26-27 and who brought Paul into the ministry Acts 11:22, 25-26 .
[89]  After this contention between Barnabas and Paul, they separated from each other, and Barnabas no longer appears in the divine record in Acts of the Lord s move in God s New Testament economy.
[90]  If Apollos had gotten into the flow of the Lord s move under Paul s teaching and under Paul s leadership, I do not think anyone would have put him into a rivalry with Paul.
[91]  Paul s leadership goes through the second section of Acts to the end of Hebrews.
[92]  His leadership was altogether based upon his divine revelation because in the divine revelation the design can be seen.
[93]  In the Lord s move on this earth from Acts through Hebrews, there was one teaching and one leadership based upon this one teaching.
[94]  The Lord raised up His recovery in mainland China in 1922 with Brother Nee, and I joined him in 1932.
[95]  We need to realize that if the one accord is absent, everything is gone.
[96]  There was a time when the real one accord was among the eight hundred saints in my hometown of Chefoo.
[97]  Whether or not you take this way, as long as you are standing on the church ground, recognizing not only your church but also all the other churches in the recovery as local churches, you are a local church.
[98]  Either you drop your job to preach, to teach, to visit people, and to work for the church full-time, or you remain in your job to make money for the Lord s move.
[99]  We must admit according to the biblical truth that God is one, the Lord is one, the Spirit is one, and Christ s Body is one, which means the church is one universally and the testimony is one.
[100]  Let us go the way of ones one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Christ, one Body, one church, one testimony, one work, one teaching, one leadership, and then one accord.
[101]  When Paul said that all who were in Asia turned away from him, this does not indicate that they turned away from the person of Paul because the person of Paul was far away from them.
