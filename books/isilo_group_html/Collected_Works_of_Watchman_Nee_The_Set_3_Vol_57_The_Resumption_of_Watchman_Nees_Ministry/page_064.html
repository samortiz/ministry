We think that we first have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces. The apostles remained first in Jerusalem. Later, Philip went to other places to preach the gospel (Acts 8:1, 5). As far as our number is concerned, we do not have enough to meet the need of the places along the coast. The political situation in northern China is very unstable. Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time. Presently, we have over thirty co-workers. The number is not large. We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long. To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people. If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai. These are only suggestions. If you think that this is right before the Lord, we can go ahead and try these things out.</p><p>Brother Chang Wu-chen, Chang Chi-jie, the two brother Chows, Hsu Jung-jieh, Weigh Kwang-hsi, Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Kwei Ru-yu, Wang Hsu-ching, Juo Fu-ru, Miao Yun-chun, Mrs. Lin Pu-ji, Mrs. Lee Yin-shin, and Mrs. Weigh Kwang-hsi should go to Fukien to join the first term of training.</p><p>Those co-workers who should remain in Shanghai are Brother David Hsu, Chang Yu-zhi, Chu Chen, Du Chung-chen, Ren Chung-shiang, Witness Lee, Jiang Shui-wu, Sister Ruth Lee, Phoebe Chang, Pearl Wang, Chow Ching-mei.</p><p>For Nanking, there are Brother Chang Yu-lan, Chi Yun-tung, and others.</p><p>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling will return to Tientsin. He should drop his job sooner or later.</p><p>Brother Lan Tsi-yi will return temporarily to Hankow. Later, if he can find others to substitute for him, he can also come to Foochow.</p><p>As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work. We still need to publish books and magazines. We hope that there can be the following publications:</p><p>(1) The Present Testimony&mdash;For the more matured ones. The content will be of a deeper nature. We ask Brother Yu to take responsibility for this paper.</p><p>(2) The Christian&mdash;For the new believers. We ask Brother Witness Lee to edit this paper.</p><p>(3) The Glad Tidings&mdash;For the gospel. We ask Brother Stephen Kaung to take more responsibility for this paper.</p><p>(4) Collection of Newsletters and The Open Door&mdash;Dealing with practical problems in the localities. We ask Sister Ruth Lee to be chief editor of these papers.</p><p>There is the need for mass publication of gospel tracts.</p><p>The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself.</p><p>The publication and distribution of these papers will be the responsibility of Chang Hsi-nien.</p><p>To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use. From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel.</p><p>To the sisters who take care of their families: We hope that you will bear a good testimony at home. At the same time, you should serve the Lord properly in the church.</p><p>To the brothers and sisters who are still in school: You should continue to go to school. There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel. While you are studying, you should prepare yourselves for this. Wherever the church puts you, you should work there. Your future is governed by the gospel.</p><p>Today we present ourselves once again before the Lord. We hope that Brother Tang and Brother Kaung will come out in the near future. By the near future, we mean the very near future. I hope that my words will not be misunderstood.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san will first return to Foochow.</p><p>Brother Hsia came out of Tsingtao. The Communists have arrived in Tsingtao. Your coming out is not a running away, but a move under orders. All the other brothers and sisters are left in the Communist-controlled areas. Many want to leave and do not want to stay.</p><p>Brother Witness has come to Shanghai, but his family is still in Nanking. His children are growing up day by day. Mrs. Lee has ways to take care of them. Without the proper care, they may be difficult to manage in the future.</p><p>Today God's work requires that all the brothers and sisters give up everything they have. Individually, we should all try to save as much money as possible. The co-workers have given up their all. The publication of the magazines alone will need so many hundreds of millions in local currency [because of war-related inflation]. The meeting hall in Foochow, the guest halls, and the place for the long-term training in Kuling all need money. We have purchased much land already, but we have not bought everything we need yet.</p><p>The meaning of handing oneself over is that everyone does the same thing and lives the same way. Yesterday, rice cost 5.5 million in local currency per sack. I admit that I was very angry at this. In the co-workers' lodging here in Shanghai, even getting food has become a problem.</p><p>We should never say that money is not needed in the preaching of the gospel. We hope that God will bless us more and will bless the brothers and sisters to have more income. Everyone who has handed himself over has given his heart and body to the gospel. Everyone has his responsibility, and unless all of us give everything we have, we cannot go on.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
