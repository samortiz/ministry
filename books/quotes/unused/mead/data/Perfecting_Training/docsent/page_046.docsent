   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN LIVING CHRIST BY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FILLED WITH THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be clear that any life matter doesn t depend so much upon knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may know this and you may know that concerning the matter of life, but knowledge doesn t work out anything for the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The matter of life must be something by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So regardless of how much we know concerning the spiritual life, if we are off from that life, it means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TRAPS FRUSTRATING THE LIVING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through all the years in the Lord s recovery, the Lord has shown us that His intention is just to be our life that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may have heard this for years, yet truthfully I must say that you haven t gotten into the habit to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many reasons why you haven t gotten into the habitual experience to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your intention to do certain things may be a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may like a small thing, such as a pair of shoes, or a pair of eye glasses, or a ring.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These things may have kept you from getting into the experience of habitually living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although you may realize many reasons which keep you and frustrate you from living Christ, it may be you haven t realized some of the reasons which are in the religious field.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything in the field, the circle, the sphere, the realm of religion may be a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are not in your spirit contacting the living Lord through the Spirit and the living Word, everything in the so-called Christian religion is a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From my youth, although I didn t know anything concerning Christianity, I heard that we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I still remember when I was around ten years of age my second sister was away from home studying at a school.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We used to correspond and my mother helped me compose a simple letter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My mother always told me to conclude the letter with this blessing: the Lord be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I didn t know what that meant, but every time I wrote, I concluded with that kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes I wrote: the Lord s peace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who was the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I didn t know.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What was the peace?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I didn t know.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That was just a religious clause to close the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This illustration may help you to know that you have been saying a lot of things and you have been writing a lot of things including good biblical terms, spiritual terms, and holy terms, yet that was just a term.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You didn t really realize what it meant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You were trapped there because you thought you knew what it meant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually you didn t know what it meant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many Christians pray, but their prayer is a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before I met Brother Nee, when people asked me to pray for them or for their father or for their mother or for this or for that, I was quick to say I would do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then I stayed with Brother Nee, and I noticed that a number of people came to him asking him to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they asked him to pray for them he was very cold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had no expression, no reaction, no response nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I saw this happen not only once but time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was with him for quite a time and when people came to him he liked to have me there so I could see the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Old people, young people, pastors, ministers, and sinners asked Brother Nee to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he was cold; even he was frozen with no expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, through further talk I got to know he had a reason for doing that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He indicated that he could not promise a man that he would pray for him because prayer was not up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It should not be initiated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prayer is up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If He initiated he would pray; he would have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Lord didn t initiate, then his prayer was something presumptuous and a kind of presumptuous sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He didn t like to have any kind of presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By this you can see that many prayers have become a trap to you, trapping you to do something apart from the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord said apart from Me you can do nothing John 15:5 , but actually we can do a lot of things apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apart from Him we can pray, we can read the Bible, we can preach the gospel, we can do everything in today s Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But all these are done by ourselves, not by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may say that they cannot do miracles apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thank God that you cannot do miracles apart from Him!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It s wonderful that there is some restriction, that there is something you can t do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But all of the ordinary things you can do, and you have done a lot, yet you never realized that all these are traps used by the enemy to trap you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don t consider others; consider yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Day after day you have been trapped in this thing and in another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I don t mean that something worldly or sinful is trapping you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything that traps you is quite Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I wouldn t say spiritual, but anyway these things always trap you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They trap you and keep you away from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All these things have one goal and one object from the enemy, and that is to keep you from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ s words in John 15 are so simple: Abide in Me and I in you...apart from Me you can do nothing John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This word is so simple but I can tell you that not even a few are really abiding in this word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have been trapped from this word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When you pray do you really abide in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you read the Bible, do you read it abiding in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If not you are trapped.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you are not abiding in Him, prayer is a trap; if you are not abiding in Him, even reading the Bible is a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many Christians only care for the knowledge of the doctrines; they don t care for the substantial, genuine experience of a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I was with the Brethren who are famous for knowing the doctrines for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the help I received of them was just knowledge; nearly not one bit was the experience of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then I got the help to experience Christ, and I looked to the Lord, that I would surely have the experience of such a living Christ rather than a lot of knowledge that had nothing to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You can see that the doctrinal knowledge or paying your attention to doctrinal points is a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is my experience.</S>
