   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us go on further by posing a question: Where is the light of revelation found?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may say that it is found in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why is the light of revelation not seen continuously in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why do we see this revelation sometimes and not see it at other times?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When does our spirit receive revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We receive it as we are being disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We receive light in our spirit based on the dealings that we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we go through dealings, our spirit sees light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The light of revelation comes under the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the discipline of the Spirit is lacking in a person, the light he receives in his spirit likewise is short.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are definite times and places for us to receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We receive light in the spirit, and we receive light during the times that we go through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, every dealing affords us a chance to receive more revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we miss a dealing, we may be missing a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we receive a dealing from God, it means that we may be receiving a revelation, a new unveiling, from Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to know God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times the Lord's hand is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He deals with us and touches us little by little, and we yield to Him little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord may have to touch us many times before we can surrender a little and before we bow our heads and say, "Lord, I am willing to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will no longer struggle."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we say this, we have the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Lord deals with us time after time, we yield to Him time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we yield to Him in this way, our spirit becomes enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we are made aware of what is happening, we begin to see the light, and the light brings in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, God uses dealings to give us light, and He also uses dealings to give us words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The words we use in our preaching should be molded through the divine dealings and trials we experience; they should not be something conjured up by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a minister of the word, we have to make sure that we are making progress in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is progress in our speaking, it means that there is progress in the dealings we are receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we first begin to speak for God, we may not have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how clever we are, how good our memory is, or how much we have received from man, we will be unable to speak effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for the Lord to give us the word, we first have to yield to His dealings, time after time, little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every dealing brings in a little speaking, and the more God deals with us, the more His speaking is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will speak to us more and more each time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we go through the dealings, we will have the right words to speak when we stand on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should pay attention to the process by which the word is formed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The formation of the word is carried out through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul said that he received a great revelation concerning the third heaven and Paradise vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third heaven is the highest heaven, while Paradise is the lowest place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One is the heaven of heavens, while the other is in the center of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul told us that he was lacking in none of these revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet these revelations could have made Paul boastful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because he was afraid that others would consider him too highly, he refrained from speaking of them v. 6 . There was also a thorn in his flesh, a messenger of Satan, which buffeted him v. 7 . He entreated the Lord three times for the thorn to depart from him, but the Lord answered, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" v. 9a . This was a spiritual revelation from God; it was not mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Paul said, "Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses...for when I am weak, then I am powerful" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>9b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that when Paul received a new revelation, he also received new knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The revelation concerning the third heaven and Paradise might very well have been Paul's highest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet he received more help from the Lord's subsequent word than from the realization of the third heaven and Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have never been to Paradise, and no one has ever come back from Paradise to tell us anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither have we been to the third heaven, and we do not know of the things from that place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet for two thousand years the church has been receiving help from the Lord's word to Paul: "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church has received more help from this word than from the revelation of the third heaven and Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where then does the ministry of the word come from?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul went through the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord brought him to the point where he could boast, "When I am weak, then I am powerful."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knew that God's grace was sufficient for him, and he received the ministry of the word in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul's ministry of the word was produced under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Utterance comes from discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The kind of revelation that is found in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is the result of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without discipline, there can be no revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without the thorn, there cannot be the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This thorn was a heavy blow to Paul; it was not an ordinary thorn but a buffeting from a messenger of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word buffeting means battering, abuse, oppression, and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul was a man of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was not afraid of sicknesses because he had passed through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When he said that something was a suffering, it surely must have been a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had a thorn, which was the buffeting of the messenger of Satan, who tried to hurt him through the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet God granted Paul grace in the midst of such severe discipline, acknowledging, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul received the revelation to know God's grace and His power, as well as his own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Countless numbers in the church of God have received deliverance through Paul's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is much easier for us to go on when we know our own weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As soon as our weaknesses leave us, power leaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if our weaknesses remain with us, power is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such a revelation, such a principle, is received through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Discipline gives us the light, and discipline also gives us the word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to learn to pick up our words one by one, like a little baby learning to speak.</S>
