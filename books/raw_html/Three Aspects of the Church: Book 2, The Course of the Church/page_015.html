	 <h2 class="head2">Fierce Wolves Entering the Flock</h2>
<p>In Acts 20, as Paul traveled to Jerusalem on his return from his third journey, he passed through Ephesus. He spoke prophetically when he said to the elders in Ephesus, &ldquo;After my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). The apostle sensed within his spirit that corruption would enter the church. We should not despise the apostle&rsquo;s word that fierce wolves will enter the flock. Fierce wolves coming in among a flock of sheep is a serious problem. In Galatians 2:11-14 there was a small problem with Peter, but he was not a fierce wolf coming in among the flock. Peter was more like a slightly sick sheep. However, Paul said that fierce wolves would come into the church in Ephesus; these were false, evil men who came into the church speaking heresy and leading people astray. This is a serious matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ Because of Envy and Strife</h2>
<p>At the time the book of Philippians was written, the desolation of the church had become more serious. In 1:15, Paul says, &ldquo;Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife.&rdquo; This shows that some people even preached the gospel because of envy and strife. They preached the gospel in this way in order to oppose the apostle Paul. Thus, when Paul wrote the book of Philippians from a Roman prison, the church was in chaos. In the age of the apostles there were those who did gospel work out of envy and strife.</p>
<p>In 1934 the Japanese imprisoned and interrogated me, but they could not charge me with any crime. One day they brought me out of my cell and asked me why people in Christianity had nothing good to say about me. I carefully considered how to answer because my interrogator was an unbeliever and also one of the invading Japanese. I could not speak poorly of my fellow Chinese. Moreover, even those who had nothing good to say about me were members of the church of God, and I could not speak negatively about the church to an unbeliever. It was a difficult question, and if I did not give a good answer, it would create trouble. I had to follow the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 10:18-20, not trusting in myself before officials but relying completely on the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit within gave me the words to speak, and I said, &ldquo;Those who are in the same line of business are usually envious one of another. If you and I both sold cloth, then I would hope that you would go out of business so that my business would prosper. This is why the Chinese have a proverb which speaks of people in the same line of business being enemies.&rdquo; My Japanese interrogator immediately laughed and expressed his agreement.</p>
<p>I did not say that others were wrong or that I was right. I only said that they had nothing good to say about me because of envy, that is, because people in the same line of business are enemies. If my business fails, all the people in my line of business will love and pity me; however, if my business is successful, my competitors will hate me. Although this scenario does not sound pleasant, it has been happening for two thousand years. Even in Philippians 1 there was such a degraded situation in the church.</p>
<p>First Timothy does not speak much about the desolation of the church, but 2 Timothy is almost entirely on this subject. J. N. Darby once said that the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books in the New Testament are all on the desolation of the church. This is the case with 2 Corinthians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and 2 and 3 John. Even the Epistle to the church in Ephesus in Revelation 2:1-7 is a kind of &ldquo;2 Ephesians.&rdquo; Darby thought that all the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books concerned the desolation of the church. Although this is not strictly accurate, it is still quite reasonable. Among the Epistles that touch the desolation of the church, the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books have much more to say than the &ldquo;first&rdquo; books.</p>
