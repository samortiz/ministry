Life’s Principle—To Change Death into Life vv. 1-11</h2><p><sup>1</sup>And the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. <sup>2</sup>And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding.</p><p><sup>3</sup>And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. <sup>4</sup>And Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come. <sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do. <sup>6</sup>Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews’ rite of purification, holding two or three measures each. <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p><p><sup>8</sup>And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took it to him. <sup>9</sup>And when the master of the feast tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom <sup>10</sup>And said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now. <sup>11</sup>This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.</p><h2 class="head4">2.
