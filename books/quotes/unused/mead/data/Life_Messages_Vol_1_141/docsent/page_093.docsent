   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Deep Things of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God" 1 Cor 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the matters pertaining to human society are superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Worldlings may be familiar with material wealth, education, or science, but there is something deeper which we experience, something beyond the concept of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others can even sense that the joy and the strength which we experience are deeper than what they know.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are a mystery to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In suffering we have a joy; in loss we have a gain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"The deep things of God" which He prepared for them that love Him are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Foundation</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ" 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do not have Christ, your life has no foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is not only the foundation of the church; without Him, you have no foundation for your personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our daily living must be founded on a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the reality of our life because He is our foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Passover</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Passover reminds us that formerly we were under God's condemnation but that God has forgiven us, passed over us, through Christ see Exo 12:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as our Passover becomes our salvation and our forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Unleavened Bread</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" 1 Cor 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament seven feasts were kept by the children of Israel Lev 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first was the Passover and the next was the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that feast nothing leavened could be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christ we enjoy a lifelong feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not sense that we are feasting, it is because we have not gotten rid of the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Leaven represents what is sinful and condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once this is gone, our Christian life becomes a happy enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord's table signifies the Passover and also reminds us of the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin and condemnation are over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are at the feast, enjoying Christ and hating sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spiritual Food, Drink, and Rock</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Our fathers were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ" 1 Cor 10:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day our food is Christ; He is the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is also the living water that flows out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The rock symbolizes the source of our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both the supply and the source of the supply are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is our dependable rock, always following us to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Him we have food, drink, and an unfailing source of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Head</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God" 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All too often the self is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Christ is not only our life; He is also to be our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unless we take Christ as our Head, we cannot properly take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This affects our personal life, our family life, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His headship is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are asked for advice by a younger one, our fellowship must be under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To tell the younger one what to do is to disregard the fact that Christ is his Head, not we.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For him to know what to do is secondary; for him to realize that Christ is his Head is primary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our Head is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not our own head; neither is anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we realize this, we are ready to know His will because we have given Him the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sisters cannot take their husband as their head without first positioning themselves to take Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only when He is the Head are we properly positioned in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We lack the experience of Christ because we do not esteem Him as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before we decide to go somewhere or to buy a pair of shoes, we must check with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By coming under His headship we shall experience Him as our reality.</S>
