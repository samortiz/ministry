   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF PERFECTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the perfecting work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are doing?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to perfect the saints to do the same work as they themselves are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A basketball coach trains the players to play basketball as he does.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the perfecters fly like angels, they must not perfect the saints to creep like snakes!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fliers must perfect all those under them to fly also!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The young ones must fly even higher than their perfecters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The outcome of this perfecting work is that all the saints become apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may not be an apostle yet, but you should have the boldness to say, "I'm an apostle-to-be"!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am presenting to you what is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We wear the tinted glasses of Christianity when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ministers and pastors are esteemed above ordinary believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Seeing this causes us to think that the gifted ones in Ephesians 4:11 are special ones and that we are insignificant nobodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even among us today there is the concept that the apostle is above the elder and that the elder is higher than the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come to the Bible, we bring this concept and insert it into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we do not come to find out the revelation from the Bible, there is no light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ALL ON ONE LEVEL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We say that among us there is no clergy or laity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet we rank some above others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we say that the gifted ones in Ephesians 4:11 are higher, then we are making ourselves lower.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means there are two levels, and a hierarchy exists.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we have only one level?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will be the case when the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers have perfected the other saints to be the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The perfecting will uplift the saints to be all on one level.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose, among the five hundred or so that are in this meeting, only fourteen are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the rest are humble, claiming not to know anything nor to be able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fourteen are then the clergy; the rest are nobodies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is Christianity's fallen situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The normal condition would be for the fourteen not to remain in a special rank, but day by day to uplift all the others, perfecting them till all of them are on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may sound humble to say that you do not know anything and cannot do anything, but you have to be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to grow and be trained and practice until you are an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OVERLAPPING GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you believe that these categories of people are all distinct from each other?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Can the prophet be an evangelist?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can the evangelist be an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider the example of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No doubt he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was he not also a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In his Epistles he prophesied how the Lord Jesus would return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does this not prove that he was a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As for being an evangelist, he surely preached the gospel far more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How about his being a shepherd?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said he was like a nourishing mother, cherishing the churches 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Surely he was a shepherd, with all the churches on his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lastly, he was also a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose two of you are burdened to go to a village in Alaska.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You leave your locality and go to an Eskimo village as sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you arrive, you begin speaking to those you meet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You speak Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you preach the gospel, some Eskimos believe in the Lord and are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They become a little church there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As you care for them and shepherd them, you will share with them about God's economy, His eternal purpose, and His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you see how the two of you are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then eventually some of the Eskimo believers will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They will do the same thing as the two of you have done.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may either work in their village or be burdened to go, for example, to Moscow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In either case they would be the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.</S>
