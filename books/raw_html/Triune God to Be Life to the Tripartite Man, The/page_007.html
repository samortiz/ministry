<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THOUGHT OF GOD TO BE MAN'S LIFE<br>RUNNING THROUGH THE DIVINE<br>REVELATION FROM BEGINNING TO END</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16, 4; 14:6a; 11:25a; 10:10b; 1 John 5:11-12; John 10:11, 15b, 17-18a, 28a; 3:14-15; Heb. 7:16; John 19:34; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 3:16, 36a; 20:31</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THOUGHT OF GOD TO BE MAN'S LIFE<br>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>The title and subject of this series of messages is "The Triune God to Be Life to the Tripartite Man." This title is very particular. In it we see that God is triune and man is tripartite. The title of the initial messages in this series, "The Thought of God to Be Man's Life Running through the Divine Revelation from Beginning to End," also is very significant. The thought of God being man's life runs through the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Let us consider again the main points of the previous message.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Creating of Living Things<br>Indicating that God Is the God of Life</H2><P>God's creating of living things indicates that God is the God of life. The whole earth is full of living things in the water, in the air, and on the land. There is the marine life in the ocean, the birds in the air, and the cattle, beasts, and creeping things on the earth (Gen. 1:20-21, 24-25). In addition to all these things, there are grass, trees, and flowers (Gen. 1:11-12). The living things that possess the consciousness of life, as well as those that do not possess such a consciousness, indicate that the Creator of them all must be one of life. The first thought in the Bible concerning God's being life to us is God's creating of living things on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Creating of Man in His Image<br>Indicating that God Wants Man<br>to Have God as His Life<br>so that Man Can Express God</H2><P>God's action in creating man in His own image (Gen. 1:26-27) indicates that God wants man to have Himself as man's life so that man can express Him. The reason God created man in His image was that man might express God. Man can express God only by having God as his life. The way God created man indicates that God wanted man to have God as his life.</P>
