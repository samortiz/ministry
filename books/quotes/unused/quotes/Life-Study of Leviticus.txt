As we come to the book of Leviticus, we first need to have a general idea about the advancement of the divine revelation
The divine revelation advances from one stage to another stage, from one level to another level, from one point to another point
Let us now consider how the divine revelation advances in the first three books of the Bible-in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus
After man rebelled against God at Babel, God gave up the created race; however, He could not and did not forsake His purpose
Eventually the race selected and called by God fell from God's selection and calling into Egypt, that is, into the world
Today's world is the expression of man's fall to the uttermost, for the world is the ultimate expression of the steps of man's fall
In the first verse we have Gods creation and in the last verse we have the issue of all the steps of mans falla man put in a coffin in Egypt
After redeeming His fallen people, God brought them to a point where He built them together to be His dwelling place on earth
Genesis ends with man in a coffin in Egypt, but in Exodus there is the way out of this coffin, the way out of this box of death
In Exodus those who had been brought back to God were charged to build a tabernacle, a dwelling place, for God
Whereas at the end of Genesis there is a coffin containing a dead body, at the end of Exodus there is a tabernacle containing the living God
Exodus 40 speaks of the tabernacle, but Leviticus 1:1, which is the continuation of Exodus, speaks of the tent of meeting
The four Gospels reveal that the God who was in the heavens and who was untouchable one day became a tabernacle, a man on earth
Our God today is not only in the heavens as God, for He, the God-man, came to earth in the form of man to be a tabernacle
In the Old Testament the priests could enter the tabernacle, and today we, the believers in Christ, can enter into God and dwell in Him
In the Bible, worship denotes our contact with God to enjoy a common portion with God for our fellowship with Him
We need to drop the religious and traditional way to worship and practice the biblical way, which is portrayed in the feasts
In Exodus God spoke on Mount Sinai, which is a bare mountain; in Leviticus God speaks in the tabernacle, which is a building
According to the principle of the typology here, God speaks in the church as His tabernacle, the tent of meeting
The extent to which a congregation is the church actually and practically depends on how much of God's speaking is there
The children of Israel camped in thousands of tents, but God's speaking was only in one tent, a unique tent-the tent of meeting
If you had been there, to which tabernacle would you have gone-to the one set up by Moses or to the one set up by Aaron?
The correct way to answer this question is to say, 'I would never go to a tabernacle where there is not God's speaking
What is revealed in Leviticus is not the law of God but the redemption of Christ, as signified by the offerings
What we have in Leviticus is not the flaming fire but God's presence as the unique grace given to His redeemed people
God's redeemed are enabled to fellowship with God, serve God, and be God's holy people living a holy life, which expresses God
When we enjoy Christ with God, there is a result, and the result is a holy living, a living in which everything in our daily life is holy
The central thought of Leviticus is that Christ is everything in the fellowship, service, and life of God's redeemed
The fact that Exodus ends with the tabernacle and Leviticus begins with the offerings indicates a direct continuation
Although Exodus and Leviticus are different in nature and in their points, there is nevertheless a direct relation between them
Because our Christ is wonderful and all-inclusive, plain words are not adequate to reveal Him and describe Him
John 129 tells us that the Christ who is the tabernacle is also the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
The tabernacle is good for us to experience, to join to, God, and the offerings are good for us to enjoy and mingle with God
The tabernacle signifies that God is in Christ for us to contact, to touch, to experience, to enter into, to join to, God
God in Christ is the tabernacle, the dwelling place, for us to approach, contact, enter, possess, and experience
After enjoying the offerings and eating them, we enter into the tabernacle, and there we enjoy all the contents of what God is in Christ
If we realize this, we shall see that it is not wise to oppose the divine revelation concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity
Paul's Epistles indicate that Christ is edible, but they do not give us the details concerning the eating of Christ
The tabernacle is for God to dwell in; the offerings are for God to enjoy through our appreciation and presentation
We see the mystery of God becoming a man to die on the cross and then rising up in resurrection for God and for us
Without our appreciation and presentation of Christ as the offerings, God cannot have any enjoyment of the offerings
If we do not appreciate these offerings and present them to God, God will not have any enjoyment of the offerings
Sacrifices are for redemption, for propitiation, whereas presents are gifts for intimate fellowship between us and God
Christ is the groceries, we are the cooks, and God and we are the co-eaters enjoying Christ as the satisfaction
We have spoken about coming to the meetings to eat, and in the meetings we have sung the short song 'Come and Dine'
Christ should not only be our food but also God's food through appreciation and presentation, that is, through our cooking
We need the pictures of the offerings in Leviticus to revolutionize our concept concerning service, worship, and the experience of Christ
Christ should first be absolutely for God's enjoyment, and then He should be for our enjoyment that we may enjoy Him together with God
In His humanity Christ was perfect, fine, and balanced; He was altogether without defects, mistakes, shortcomings, and wrongdoings
If Christ had not been absolute for God, He could not have been our sin offering to deal with the sin in our nature
If He had not been perfect in His humanity, He could not have been our trespass offering to take away our trespasses
Christ's being these four offerings consummates in peace between God and God's people, and this peace is simply Christ Himself
Verse 5 says, 'Wherefore, coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me'
If we feel that we are sinful and need to offer something to God, this offering for sin, strictly speaking, is a sacrifice
What is the will mentioned in verses 7, 9, and 10, and what is the meaning of the words 'I come to do Your will'?
Some Bible teachers say that this means that everything the Lord Jesus did and said was according to God's will
Hebrews 10:5-10 clearly indicates that the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types, shadows, of Christ
The person who replaced the offerings and sacrifices had to be one who was absolutely for God, even in every small thing
To take away the first and establish the second is to take away the old covenant and establish the new covenant
When He was on earth, there never was a time when a small thing caused Him to lose His oneness with the Father
It was a great thing for the Lord Jesus to do God's will-to be the burnt offering to replace the Old Testament offerings and sacrifices
If we had been regenerated without having become fallen, it would have been hard for us to break the oneness with the Lord in our living
We may exercise our spirit to have a life that is one with the Lord, but often a small thing will cause this oneness to be broken
The burnt offering signifies Christ not mainly for redeeming man's sin but for living for God and for God's satisfaction
His divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues, and sometimes His human virtues were expressed in and with His divine attributes
Having through His incarnation a body prepared for Him by God to be the real burnt offering He did Gods will and was obedient unto death
If Christ was to be a burnt offering for God, He had to be such a living one, one with a strong will but with His will subdued to God's will
Because the Lord's will was subdued to God's will, the Lord was preserved and protected in His perfection, in His being without blemish
As the Lord Jesus lived and moved on earth, He never became blemished because His will was subdued to God's will
The burnt offering was offered at the entrance of the tent of meeting , that is, in the outer court of the tabernacle
In the Scripture, the laying on of hands always signifies identification, union; it does not signify substitution
To lay our hand on the offering means that we are one with the offering and take the offering as being one with us
Laying our hands on Christ as the burnt offering is not just a matter of identification; it is also a matter of propitiation
The sprinkling of the blood around the altar was for the acceptance by God of the offering burned on the altar
The cutting of the offering into pieces signifies Christ's being willing to let His entire being be broken without any reservation
If we did not have Christ as our burnt offering, we would have to suffer being slaughtered, skinned, and cut into pieces
If these chapters only told us what Christ is totally as the offerings, then these chapters would be merely objective teachings of doctrines
These chapters are not merely objective teachings, but they reveal to us the subjective experiences we may have of Christ
If we do not realize this point, we shall be bothered by certain things in Leviticus 1, for instance, the washing of the burnt offering
In Leviticus 1 Christ as the burnt offering is seen first as a bull second as a sheep or a goat and finally as a turtledove or a pigeon
In coming to the tent of meeting, we should not come empty-handed, but we should come with something of Christ
Leviticus 12 says When anyone of you brings an offering to Jehovah you shall bring your offering from the cattle of the herd or of the flock
Paul was a busy person; he labored more than all the other apostles, yet it was not he but the grace of God that was with him
To labor on Christ as the good land is to till the ground, to sow the seed, to water the seed, and to take care of the crop
The way of offering is thus both a demonstration of our experience of Christ's experience and of how we have experienced Christ's experience
If we have the real experience of Christ's being slaughtered, we shall not resist being led to the slaughter by our husband or wife
If we in the churches have this experience there will be no quarreling or fighting but only the experience of being brought to the slaughter
If this is our experience, we shall have a large burnt offering to bring to God, and we shall have much praise in the tent of meeting
What we present to God will be a demonstration of how we have experienced Christ's experience of being slaughtered
The skinning of the burnt offering signifies Christ's willingness to let the outward expression of His virtues be stripped
He was skinned by the Corinthians who accused him of sending Titus to them for the purpose of taking money from them
We may find it hard to believe that the spreading of evil reports concerning Paul was an evidence that he was an apostle
Will you not try to restore the good report concerning you, to recover the outward expression of your virtues?
If you are a person with this kind of experience the praise you offer even if it is short at the Lords table will deeply touch the meeting
When she comes to the meeting, she may look at a certain saint, thinking that this saint has not been fair with her
If the saints have complaints against one another, it will be difficult to have a living, uplifted Lord's table meeting
If we labor on Christ in this way, then as the produce to be offered to God we shall have the Christ who was cut into pieces
The priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah'
As a result of this slow burning there was a satisfying fragrance, a savor that brought satisfaction, peace, and rest
When we offer a burnt offering in smoke to God, a fragrance well-pleasing to God will ascend to Him for His satisfaction and rest
By passing through all these processes we shall have something to offer to God as our burnt offeringthe very Christ whom we have experienced
Regarding the way to offer the burnt offering as revealed in Leviticus 1, there are a number of puzzling points
The priests here are of three classes: Aaron, the sons of Aaron, and an individual priest, a priest who is singled out for service
Rather, here in relation to the offering of the burnt offering, we have the service of Aaron's sons or the service of a particular priest
According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering could be a bull, a sheep or a goat, or turtledoves or young pigeons
With the offerings in the third category the offerer simply brought the offering to the tent of meeting and the priests did everything else
The priest brought the offering to the altar nipped its head took away its crop tore it by the wings and offered it up in smoke on the altar
In contrast to worldly people who have no appreciation or realization of Christ a new believer has begun to have some appreciation of Christ
When someone offers Christ as a turtledove, this offering needs to be processed by someone other than the offerer
As we have indicated, the size of a believer's offering and the way he offers it depend on his spiritual maturity, capacity, and ability
Some saints may offer Christ as the burnt offering in a way that is not natural and with an offering that is not whole but processed
Such saints, who are matured and rich in the ability to apprehend, realize, and appreciate Christ, have had very deep experiences of Christ
They have experienced what is signified by the different parts of the burnt offering: the head, the fat, the inwards, and the legs
To experience Christ's inwards is to experience His sensibility, affections, feelings, thoughts, will, intentions, and purposes
A believer who offers Christ as turtledoves or pigeons certainly does not have the kind of appreciation of Christ that a mature believer has
His offering, even though raw and unprocessed, was accepted, but it was accepted through the work of the priest who processed the offering
As we apply this matter of the processing of the offering by the priests, we need to ask a question: Who are the serving priests today?
As the young believer listens to these prayers and testimonies, he may realize that his way of offering Christ was natural and unprocessed
The priests are those saints who, in the church meetings, process a burnt offering that is offered in a natural way
When you first came into the church life, your way of offering Christ, either by a prayer or by a testimony, may have been quite natural
We all need to see that the difference in the burnt offerings is not only in their size but also in the way they are offered
The mature, experienced ones not only offer a larger Christ, but they offer Christ absolutely in a processed way
Those who experience Christ in this way will appreciate the details concerning the Lord's life recorded in the four Gospels
Those who offer Christ in a natural way as birds need the older saints to be the priests to help them to process their offering
What we offer of Christ as the burnt offering is only what we have apprehended, realized, and appreciated of Christ
Now, by the Lord's mercy, the presentation of Christ in my teaching and preaching is no longer very much in a natural way
As our realization, apprehension, appreciation, and experience of Christ improve, our way of offering Christ will also improve
Eventually, anything natural, especially any natural concepts, in our way of offering Christ will be dealt with
If we daily and hourly live a life of experiencing Christ, we shall have Christ as a burnt offering to offer to God
The point here is that we cannot offer Christ as a burnt offering if we do not live Christ and experience Christ in our daily walk
The first experiences Christ as a bull the second experiences Christ as a lamb or a goat and the third experiences Christ as a pair of birds
In his living of Christ, he first experiences Christ's crucifixion; he experiences Christ's being slaughtered on the cross
As this brother experiences Christ's death in such a way, he will also experience Christ's being stripped of His outward beauty
In the four Gospels we see that while our Lord was living on earth, He had the experience of being stripped of His outward beauty
As the brother experiences being conformed to Christ's death, he spontaneously experiences Christ's being stripped of His outward beauty
The Lord Jesus had many evil reports spread about Him, and these evil reports stripped Him of the outward appearance of His human virtues
The Gospels reveal that, as far as His humanity was concerned, the Lord Jesus was cut into pieces in every way
Not one aspect of His human life was left whole; on the contrary, every part of His human life was cut into pieces
The brother whose living is an experience of Christ's life will experience Christ's head; that is, he will experience Christ's wisdom
Under God's sovereignty, this brother's family, including his parents, wife, and children, may be difficult to deal with
In his relationship with the members of his family, he spontaneously experiences the head, the wisdom, of Christ
The wisdom by which Christ lived in relation to His family thus becomes this brother's experience in his daily life
The brother who offers Christ as a bull will also experience the washing of the legs and the inward parts of the burnt offering
The continual washing of the Holy Spirit as the water will keep him from defilement both outwardly and inwardly
As the brother presents his burnt offering, he will slaughter it, skin it, cut it into pieces, and wash its legs and its inwards
The way the brother presents the burnt offering will be a display of his experience; it will be a review of his daily experience
Without the daily experience there could not be such a review, for there would be nothing to display or demonstrate
Leviticus 1:4 says that the offering from the herd would be accepted for the offerer 'to make propitiation for him'
Regarding this matter, the brother does not have anything to review or to demonstrate when he offers his burnt offering
His offering of Christ, therefore, is a review, a display, and a demonstration of his daily experiences of Christ
Let us now consider the situation with a brother whose offering of Christ as the burnt offering is typified by turtledoves or young pigeons
In his daily life there is no appreciation of the fact that on his behalf Christ lived a life which was absolutely for God
Eventually he learns something of Christ as the One who lived such a life, and he begins to appreciate Christ in this respect
The serving priests then wring off the head, remove the crop and the feathers, and tear the offering by its wings
Paul, for example, offered neither himself nor his experiences of the burnt offering; he offered the Christ whom he had experienced
On the one hand, we should not offer ourselves and our experiences; on the other hand, we should not merely offer Christ
Rather, the offerer's review of his experience will determine the size of his offering, and it will also determine the way he offers it
Just as the offerer does not have the right to sprinkle the blood, so he does not have the right to actually offer the offering
According to Leviticus 1:9 and 13, the offerer was to wash the inwards and the legs of his offering with water
The slaughtering of the offering by the offerer is a review of the offerer's experience in his daily life of Christ's crucifixion
The Holy Spirit, here signified by the water, preserved Christ from being contaminated by outward matters He contacted while He was on earth
The offerer has experienced this in his daily life, and he therefore reviews and demonstrates this as he offers Christ as his burnt offering
In Leviticus 1, verses 9, 13, 15, and 17 speak of the burning, that is, of the offering up of the burnt offering in smoke
The Hebrew for 'offer up in smoke,' a special term used for the burning on the altar of burnt offering, implies the matter of incense
The Hebrew word rendered 'accept' can be translated not only as 'turn to ashes' but also as 'accept as fat,' 'make fat,' and 'be as fat'
In our eyes the offering has been turned to ashes, but in God's eyes it is fat; it pleases and satisfies Him as fat
For the burnt offering to be turned to ashes means that God is satisfied and that we therefore may be at peace
The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has offered'
If you try to offer as a burnt offering to God a Christ whom you have not experienced, you will discover that this is impossible
If we have experienced Christ only as two pigeons, we cannot offer Him as a bull, for we have not experienced Him as a bull
The fulfillment of this prophecy can be seen in Matthew 27:31, where we are told that the soldiers 'led Him away to crucify Him'
In Mark 3:22 the scribes said of the Lord Jesus, 'He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons'
The scribes were saying that the Lord Jesus was unclean and that He cast out demons by the lord, the king, of the flies
Also the chief priests with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save!
Before He was judged by God on our behalf during the second three hours, He was cut into pieces by men during the first three hours
The occasion for the maxim in Mark 9:40 was the case of someone not following the Lord and the disciples, yet casting out demons in His name
The Pharisees, who were opposing the Lord Jesus, had accused Him of casting out demons 'by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons'
The Lord Jesus spoke another wise word when He was questioned by the chief priests and elders of the people about His authority
The opposers reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
If He had said that it was lawful to do this, He would have offended the Jews, whose leaders were the Pharisees
If He had said that it was not lawful, this would have given the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, strong ground to accuse Him
When they answered, 'Caesar's,' He said to them, 'Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God'
The Lord Jesus answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind
In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus said, 'I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me'
How much the Sender that is the Father was pleased by such a One the One who came to do not His own will but the will of Him who sent Him
Isaiah 53:12 prophesied concerning the Lord Jesus in His death on the cross: 'He hath poured out his soul unto death'
Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness forty days being tempted by the Devil
In the previous message we considered the different aspects of Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God
The Hebrew word translated 'burnt offering' literally means 'that which goes up' and thus denotes something that ascends to God
The only thing that can ascend to God from earth is the life lived by Christ, for He is the unique person to live a life absolutely for God
To take Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering, there is no need for us to experience what Christ experienced
Offering Christ as our burnt offering is not effective unless we have had some experience of His experience as the burnt offering
We can offer Christ as the burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Him as this offering
A person does not need any experience of Christ in order to offer Him to God as the sin offering and as the trespass offering
We can take Christ as the burnt offering only to the extent to which we have experienced Him in His experience
If we have not experienced anything of Christ in His experience as the burnt offering, we cannot offer Him to God as the burnt offering
The reason we are not willing to be slaughtered, stripped, and cut into pieces is that we are not absolute toward God
It is natural for there to be problems among the unsaved people in society, but why are there problems among the saints in the church?
One party may want to give an amount of money for a certain purpose, but the other party may want that money to be given for another purpose
We may give different reasons for this separation, but in the eyes of God the problem was due to one thing-not being absolute toward God
Let us now consider in detail our experience of Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering for God's satisfaction
In Philippians 310 Paul says To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
Christ was brought to the slaughter at Golgotha, but that was not the only time He was brought to the slaughter
Paul lived a life that was a repetition of the life of the burnt offering which Christ lived when He was on earth
He met with James and all the elders, relating to them the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry
The Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple and 'threw all the crowd into confusion; and they laid their hands on him'
We see that Paul surely had the experience of being brought to the slaughter; he experienced what the Lord Jesus experienced
If you are willing to live a burnt-offering life, you may sometimes experience being brought to the slaughter by the brothers in the church
If you do not experience Christ's experience of being brought to the slaughter, your burnt offering will only be two pigeons
If we experience Christ in His being slaughtered, we shall have something of Christ to offer to God as a burnt offering
We need to apply to our daily situations Christ's experiences of being brought to the slaughter and of being slaughtered
The reason we still have problems with others is that we are not willing to experience Christ in His experiences
We may also experience Christ in His being skinned, that is, in His being stripped of the outward appearance of His human virtues
In John 8:48 the Jews said of the Lord Jesus, 'Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon'?
According to Mark 3:22, the scribes said of Him, 'He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons'
With these words the Lord Jesus predicted that His followers would be defamed and slandered and have lies told about them
According to the New Testament, our destiny as followers of Christ is to suffer such a skinning, experiencing Christ in His being skinned
If you say something on your own behalf, this is a sign that you are not willing to experience Christ in His experience of being skinned
Do you think that the more you follow the Lord Jesus, the more you will be respected and highly regarded by others?
His disciples respected Him and held Him in high regard, but to the opposers, who cut Him into pieces, He was offscouring and scum
To experience Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God is to experience Him in His experience of being cut into pieces
In this message we shall consider further aspects of our experiences of Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God
The proper Christian life, a life of abiding in the Lord that we may enjoy His life, is a life of doing things not by ourselves but by Him
We spontaneously live ourselves without trying to do so and without deliberately exercising any part of our being
We usually consider whether or not a certain thing is sinful, but God considers whether we are living by ourselves or by Christ
Even if our behavior does not seem to be sinful, if we live by ourselves and not by Christ, sin will issue forth
God's wisdom is Christ , who is the hidden mystery , predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory
Christ is the wisdom of God and He is the wisdom in a mystery the hidden wisdom and the One predestined by God before the ages for our glory
If we live Christ and He becomes our wisdom in our living, we shall experience a little of this glory even today
We may think that Paul was extraordinary, that his living was incomparable, and that his standard is too high for us
If we let Christ live for us and if we live by Christ and even live Christ, our life will surely be a delight to God
We shall know that we are living a life which is a repetition of the life of Christ and which is a delight to God
The 'this' here refers to verse 17, which tells us that the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
Christ's inwards denotes all the inward parts of His being, including His mind, emotion, will, and heart with all their functions
The Greek word translated 'inward parts' literally means bowels, signifying inward affection, then tender mercy and sympathy
If we put these verses together, we shall see that Paul was a man who continually experienced Christ's inwards
Because he experienced Christ in this way, he surely was able to offer Christ according to his experience of Him
Finally, we may experience Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering in His being kept by the Holy Spirit from defilement
In Romans 121 he goes on to say Present your bodies a living sacrifice holy wellpleasing to God which is your most reasonable service
Where can you find a group of Christians who daily offer to God as a burnt offering the Christ they have experienced?
We may want to offer praise to God, but if we are lacking in the experience of Christ's experiences, we shall not have anything to utter
The Father wants us to worship Him by offering His Son to Him according to a procedure in which we review our experiences
We cannot do this in ourselves, but we can do it by the indwelling, resurrected Christ, who Himself is resurrection
Paul does not say, 'I take Christ as my pattern and follow Him'; he says, 'I have been crucified with Christ' and 'Christ lives in me'
Suppose a brother takes this advice and determines to follow Christ in his married life and never quarrel with his wife
In Galatians 2:20 Paul says that he has been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives but now Christ lives in him
What a great difference there is between trying to imitate Christ outwardly and being in Christ living Christ and having Christ live in us!
Of making up our mind not to quarrel with our spouse, we should live Christ, a life that is not ourselves, a life that never quarrels
If we are such persons, we will not yield to the temptation to quarrel with our husband or wife no matter how much we are tempted
It is a wonderful fact that we have such a person living within us, and we can live Him and take Him as our person
In this message we shall begin to consider chapter two of Leviticus, which is concerned with the meal offering
The emphasis of the burnt offering is on Christ's living for God, even unto death, implying His living but emphasizing His death
The emphasis of the meal offering is on Christ's human living and daily walk, implying His death but emphasizing His living
In the burnt offering we can see Christ as righteousness, for the burnt offering indicates that Christ is God's righteousness
On the one hand, as the sin offering Christ was made sin; on the other hand, as the trespass offering Christ bore our sins
We also should be God's righteousness, satisfying God to such an extent that we become to God a satisfying fragrance
Their experience, and mine as well, was like that of Paul in Romans 7: 'To will is present with me, but to do the good is not
The only way to overcome your temper is to live another person, the One who is not temper but the righteousness of God'
As the burnt offering He is the very righteousness of God, and as the meal offering He is the most righteous One
The fine flour is perfect in fineness, evenness, tenderness, and gentleness and is fully balanced, with no excess and no deficiency
During the course of His human life, Christ suffered a great deal, but the aroma of His resurrection was manifested out from His sufferings
The Lord Jesus continually lived and walked in these three things-in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection
Concerning this, we need to realize that the Lord Jesus was crucified not only at the very end of His life but that He was crucified daily
His crucifixion, which lasted six hours, was the totality of His being slaughtered, skinned, and cut into pieces
Because the Lord Jesus lived daily under the cross, He always expressed resurrection from His humanity mingled with His divinity
If we keep this in mind as we read the Gospels, we will see what kind of person Christ was while He lived on earth
Even when the Lord Jesus was arrested and crucified, He lived a life of humanity mingled with divinity and expressing resurrection
Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son
No matter what the circumstances were, the Lord Jesus lived a life of suffering but expressing the fragrance of His resurrection
In every place and at every time, Christ lived a life in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection
Whereas the burnt offering is God's food, the meal offering is our food for our satisfaction, with a little portion shared with God
In Leviticus 1 the burnt offering must be a bull from the herd, a goat or a sheep from the flock, or turtledoves or pigeons
As a type of Christ, the vegetable life indicates the produce, the propagation, and the increase to supply life for people to live by
The oil anoints the meal offering and is mingled with it; the frankincense is sprinkled upon the meal offering
Concerning the blood, the oil, and the frankincense, we have a very significant difference between the burnt offering and the meal offering
The remainder of the meal offering, consisting of fine flour and oil but no frankincense, was to be food for the priests
If we would serve God as priests, we need to eat the priestly food, the holy food that befits our holy service
Christ's human living on earth was excellent, but it is difficult for us to say what this excellence refers to
The frankincense with part of the fine flour and the oil was burned as a memorial because of its satisfying effect
A satisfying fragrance is a sweet savor; it is a fragrance that gives rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction
The remainder of the meal offering is for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy portion of the offerings of Jehovah by fire'
To eat the fine flour is to eat the oil; it is also to eat the mingling, for the oil and the flour cannot be separated
The picture in Leviticus 2 indicates strongly that the way for us to enjoy Christ's human living is by the Spirit
Unable to understand this, the Jews 'contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat'?
To eat Jesus, to take Jesus, to enjoy Jesus, we must touch His word, and when we touch His word, the Spirit is there
When we come to the word, we should not merely exercise our eyes and our mind, reading the word as if it were a newspaper
By exercising our spirit to touch the Spirit consolidated in the word, we eat the human life and living of Christ
Over a period of fifteen hundred years, God has prepared a book for us, the Bible, and has put it in our hands
All meal offerings, whether baked in an oven, roasted on a griddle, or fried in a pan, are through fire on the altar
The portion of the meal offering that was offered to God as God's food for His satisfaction was burned, that is, consumed by fire
Furthermore, Darby's note on the word mingled in Leviticus 2:4 says: ''Mixed,' 'mingled,' is the sense of the word
In the early part of the Christian era, there was much debate about the matter of the mingling of divinity with humanity
Eventually, theologians did not dare to use the word mingle or to teach concerning the mingling of humanity and divinity
Paul thought that he was persecuting only Stephen and other disciples; he had no realization that he was actually persecuting Christ
In such a mingling of two elements, the elements remain distinct, and there is not the producing of a third element
In this type, mingling is clearly depicted: the oil is mingled with the fine flour, and the fine flour is mingled with the oil
Although these two elements are mingled, the essence of each element remains distinct, and a third element is not produced
Nothing damages the church life, the Lord's ministry, and the Lord's work more than ambition and natural affection
If we want to serve the Lord for a long period of time, we must look to the Lord to purify us from ambition and natural affection
We should not be ambitious, and we should not have natural affection, for such affection will bring in rottenness
The salt here is not common; it is the salt of the covenant of God, the covenant which is incorruptible and unchangeable
Far in the meal offering we have seen the Spirit Christs resurrection and Christs humanity but we have not yet seen the death of Christ
We will be pure, and we will live a life like that of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth, a life without leaven and honey but full of salt
And if your offering is a meal offering on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened
All the other items in this offering are the same in significance as those in the offering of fine flour on the griddle
My burden in this message is to fellowship with you concerning the practical experience and enjoyment of Christ as the offerings
According to Hebrews 10:7-9, Christ came in the flesh to do the will of God, which was to replace the Old Testament offerings with Himself
The 'first' denotes the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament, and the 'second' denotes Christ as the unique sacrifice, the unique offering
In the Old Testament there were many offerings, but in the New Testament there is one, unique offering-the wonderful person of Christ
In chapter after chapter, Paul opens the veil to show us the marvelous, mysterious, all-inclusive person of Christ
Christ offered Himself not only as a sacrifice for sin but also as a gift to please God and thereby make Him happy
We today have received much help from the Bible teachers who preceded us, and we are standing on their shoulders
All those who have the proper understanding of Leviticus see the connection between this book and the book of Hebrews
In the books of Exodus and Leviticus we see that the priests, who served in and around the tabernacle, ate the priestly food
The offerings are also for satisfying God and for satisfying, strengthening, and energizing God's serving ones
The top portion of Christ as the offerings is God's food for His enjoyment, and the remainder is our food for our enjoyment
Christ is surely revealed in Leviticus, but He is revealed here in a 'language' different from that used in the Gospels
On the one hand, the Lord Jesus tells us that He is the reality; on the other hand, He speaks of the Spirit of reality
After He had been crucified to accomplish an all-inclusive redemption and had entered into resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit
What the Father is, what the Son is, and what the Spirit is have all been consummated into this all-inclusive Spirit
The Bible reveals that Christ is a wonderful person and that this wonderful person is today the life-giving Spirit
To have this experience and enjoyment of Christ we need to pray, saying, 'Lord Jesus, You are a wonderful person
Among Christians today, including us, there is a lack of enjoying Christ by releasing our spirit through the word in the Bible
If we daily enjoy Christ by releasing our spirit through the word and touching the Spirit, we will be full of Christ
On the other hand, we need to minister the Christ we have enjoyed to others, especially to weaker ones who are still living in sin
In Himself, Christ is the reality of the offerings, but He cannot be this reality to us apart from His being the life-giving Spirit
Others may say that the main offering is the burnt offering, which signifies Christ as the One who is absolute for God
One of these things is the matter of enjoying the offerings in order to be constituted to become a certain kind of person
In the Gospels the Lord Jesus speaks of the leaven of the Pharisees, the leaven of the Sadducees, and the leaven of Herod
From this illustration we see that the issue of both hatred, which is leaven, and natural love, which is honey, is the same
The negative things are leaven, and the good aspects of the natural life signified by honey eventually ferment and become leaven
The life Christ lived on earth was a life without leaven and without honey, and we should live the same kind of life today
We need to have the four positive elements-fine flour, oil, frankincense, and salt-but not the two negative elements-leaven and honey
From the time of conception, that is, from the very beginning of His manhood, His humanity was wrapped up with the Holy Spirit
As Jesus was baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him'
On the one hand in His humanity He was mingled with the Holy Spirit on the other hand the Holy Spirit was poured upon Him and anointed Him
Everything He did in His ministry was done in the Spirit-in the essential Spirit and also in the economical Spirit
He was brought to Pilate to be judged by the Roman authority, but Pilate declared that he could not find any fault in Him
One day, while He was speaking to the crowds, 'His mother and His brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him
In ourselves we cannot have this kind of love, for our natural tendency is to have a love that is on different levels
Mark 10:38 and John 12:24 indicate that the Lord Jesus was always salted, that He always lived a life under the shadow of the cross
Whenever we are welcomed or exalted by others, we should apply salt to ourselves and be persons who want not to be exalted but to die
Since the Lord Jesus always lived a life of being salted, a life under the cross, He was always in resurrection
For the Lord Jesus to live in resurrection meant that He denied Himself and His natural life and that He lived not Himself but the Father
Even before He was crucified, the Lord Jesus lived a life in resurrection, denying the natural life and living the Father's life
The top portion of the meal offering, the portion containing the frankincense, was burned in fire for God's satisfaction
We should also continually receive the salt; that is, we should receive Christ's cross and put our natural deeds to death
From this we see that all the frankincense in Christ as the meal offering is burned to produce a fragrance for God's satisfaction
Rather, it should be a humanity which is mingled with the Holy Spirit and which has the Holy Spirit poured upon it
In other words, for the church life we need to be oiled persons, those who are oiled by the Spirit and with the Spirit
We should be fully dependent on the Holy Spirit, being oiled with Him inwardly and having Him poured upon us outwardly
We will also live a life that is through salt and in frankincense that is a life that is through the death of Christ and in His resurrection
The salt will deal with the leaven, with the germs of sin; the salt will also deal with the honey, putting the natural life to death
The meal offering church life can be burned to produce a satisfying fragrance for God, and the remainder of this offering will be our food
Love rejoices with the truth, covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things
1:30 says, 'Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
In 3:16 he goes on to say, 'Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you'?
From that time on, they had Christ as another person living in them, and He uplifted their humanity and changed their character
They dropped the idea of divorce and began to live together in sweetness, in the fragrance of Christ's resurrection
Those who are married should not leave their wife or husband, for to leave one's spouse is actually to leave God
Corinthians 118 says The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness but to us who are being saved it is the power of God
We may experience this in our married life, for every wife is a cross to her husband and every husband is a cross to his wife
Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth'
In this meal offering the top portion is for God's enjoyment, and the remainder is for us to take as our daily food in our service to God
He desires that every local church be a meal offering that satisfies Him and that fully supplies the saints day by day
The church life satisfies us because the church life is a corporate meal offering, with the top portion for God and the remainder for us
In the wilderness apart from millions of people who were busy doing many things the very God who created the universe came into a small tent
Every aspect of this speaking concerning Christ and our enjoyment of Christ in togetherness with God will be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem
The burnt offering signifies that we must be absolutely for God, and the meal offering indicates that Christ is our daily food
The prodigal son came back in a wretched way, but the father was loving, and he immediately became the receiving father
If we would enjoy Christ as peace in a practical, daily way, we must first take Him as our burnt offering to satisfy God
Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings, we may not have had the knowledge of the pictures in Leviticus
Earlier you might have had a problem and thus were not at peace with God, but now there is no problem, and you are at peace
At other times something happens, perhaps some disturbance in our family life, that limits our enjoyment of Christ
If we are weak, we enjoy a weaker Christ, not a Christ who is weak in Himself but who is weaker in our experience due to our weakness
The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar; it is the food of the offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance'
It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations wherever you dwell, that you shall not eat any fat or any blood'
In the foregoing messages we covered the first three of the five basic offeringsthe burnt offering the meal offering and the peace offering
The divine sequence opens with the burnt offering, showing us that the primary thing with us should be that we are absolute for God
The burnt offering is followed by the meal offering, which shows us that we should take Christ as our life supply and live by Him daily
Although we have peace, we still have certain problems-sin within and sins without-and these surely need to be dealt with
The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin in singular and the word sins in plural
Sins refer to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18 to 5:11
Through our fellowship with God, who is light, we discover that we are sinful, that we have sin inwardly and sins outwardly
Inwardly we have a sinful 'mother,' and outwardly we have sinful deeds, which are the 'children' of this sinful mother
If we have strife, jealousy, divisions, and parties in our church life or family life, we are living and acting in the flesh
If we say that we have fellowship with God and still have these works of the flesh, we are walking in darkness and we are self-deceived
If we have strife, jealousy, divisions, and parties in our church life, this means that our church life is in darkness
If we say that we are in fellowship with God but are wrong in our attitude toward our husband or wife, we are self-deceived
If we have criticized certain brothers or taken sides with certain saints, we will realize that this also is wrong
Only what we do by walking, speaking, and behaving absolutely according to the spirit, setting our mind on the spirit , is not of the flesh
In Romans 8:4 Paul says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the spirit
Although the flesh has been buried, it will still try to incite us to think negatively about our wife or husband or about certain brothers
Whenever we have the experience of enjoying peace with the Triune God, we will realize our need of the sin offering
According to the New Testament, there are four things that cannot be separated: sin, the flesh, Satan, and the world
Paul makes this clear when he tells us in Romans 8:3 that God sent 'His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin'
Ryrie says, 'Jesus Christ was unique, for He was God from all eternity and yet joined Himself to sinful humanity in the incarnation'
The type of the brass serpent indicates that Christ did not have the flesh of sin but only the likeness of the flesh of sin
In the Gospel of John three figures are used to describe Christ in His death: the Lamb of God , the brass serpent , and a grain of wheat
We have Him as our Savior in three aspects-to deal with our sin, to destroy the old serpent, and to produce us as the many sons of God
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
Through the death of Christ not only was sin condemned and not only was our old man crucified, but also Satan, the Devil, was destroyed
Through the death of Christ on the cross four things were dealt with: sin in the flesh, the old man, Satan, and the world
Adam's fall opened the gate for sin, which is the nature of Satan and even Satan himself, to come into our being
We have often wanted to do good, for example to honor our parents or regard our brother, yet the outcome was just the opposite
Verse 26, the concluding verse of this section, says, 'Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another'
We may think that the things mentioned in 5:16-26 existed among the churches of Galatia but are not among us today
We should not read these verses as applying to them alone; we should include ourselves when we read such verses
All the good speeches, lectures, and explanations given by men are just cloaks to cover the struggle for power
Taking Christ as our sin offering also means that our old man, Satan, the world, and the struggle for power are dealt with
One brother may take Christ as his sin offering to deal only with his sin, not realizing that sin implies the flesh
A second brother may realize that the sin offering implies the flesh but may not realize that it also implies dealing with Satan
Some of the blood of the sin offering was brought into the tent of meeting and sprinkled seven times toward the veil of the Holy of Holies
Every human being, including little children, likes to be a prince, a leader, and everywhere on earth today there is a power struggle
When we repented to the Lord and received Him as our Savior, we were enlightened to see that we are evil and under God's condemnation
Eventually, we are brought to the realization that even today as a Christian seeking after the Lord we are nothing but a totality of sin
If we realize that we are sinful and begin to confess our sins, we may find that the more we confess, the more there is to confess
In dealing with sin, Paul was eventually brought to something deeper-not merely to sin itself but to the law of sin
It was through his experience with the commandment regarding greed, or coveting, that Paul discovered the law of sin
When he tried to obey this commandment, something within him rose up and wrought in him 'coveting of every kind'
The whole offering, including its hide, all its flesh, with its head, legs, inwards, and dung, was burned outside the camp
Christ was crucified outside Jerusalem, which was considered a camp representing the Jewish religious organization
When all the congregation of Israel sinned ignorantly, the elders were to represent the assembly to offer the sin offering
Rather, both our hatred and our love are from our flesh, and both are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
We need to realize that anything we do out of ourselves, whether good or evil, is for ourselves, and since it is for ourselves it is sin
Whatever is in the flesh is sin, whatever is sin in our flesh is Satan, and whatever is done there by Satan is the power struggle
We may do something that is very good, yet deep within our hidden intention is to do that good thing for ourselves
The experience of the sin offering is altogether related to our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus as our burnt offering
We take Him as our sin offering more deeply than ever, and this causes us to enjoy Him more as the burnt offering
Whenever we touch the holy things, the spiritual things, and the service of God in the church life, we must bring the sin offering with us
By taking Him and enjoying Him as the burnt offering, our sinfulness is exposed, and we see that we are not absolutely for God as He is
Others in the church life may appreciate us, but inwardly we know that we are not good, that we are not absolute for God
We are delivered and saved from sin, from the flesh, from Satan, from the world, from the prince of the world, and from the power struggle
We may think that, as the last of the five basic offerings, the trespass offering is not very important and rather easy to understand
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
Whereas the sin offering deals with the sin in our nature inwardly, the trespass offering deals with the sins in our conduct outwardly
As the marginal notes in the American Standard Version indicate, Isaiah 53:10 puts the trespass offering together with the sin offering
We see that two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, form the trespass offering
We are fallen, a fallen person is flesh, and this flesh is sin, which produces trespasses as the children, as the fruit
The sin offering takes care of the source; the trespass offering takes care of the 'children,' or the 'fruits,' produced from this source
If we are really for God and live for Him, especially in the church life, we will be faithful, honest, and sincere to testify what we know
To fail in this matter is to be dishonest and unfaithful; it is to be unlike our God, who is faithful and honest
We see that if a person does nothing more than touch a carcass, he is unclean, for he has touched the uncleanness of death
The words 'it is hidden from him' indicate that we may not be aware that we have touched the uncleanness of spiritual death
If we are enlightened by the Lord, we will realize how much we have touched the uncleanness of spiritual death and have been defiled by it
If you take that word, you will be defiled, for you will touch the uncleanness of man, the uncleanness of the natural being
If we are enlightened by the Lord through this portion of the Word, we will realize that we surely need the trespass offering
The word in Leviticus 5 was spoken not to an individual saint but to God's congregation, to God's people as an assembly
Rather, this word was given for the purpose of keeping God's chosen people, as a body, proper, holy, and separated to Him
God does not have the intention to make the entire human society a congregation like the children of Israel in ancient times
The tabernacle was in the midst of the people, and God wanted the people, who were around the tabernacle, to be holy
In typology this indicates that among God's people there may be three kinds of death: wild death, mild death, and subtle death
Among God's people, that is, in the church life, there may not only be death; there may be different kinds of death
Either we do not care for one another or we love one another in a natural way, in the way of natural affection
We have the matter of speaking rashly, of speaking something before God in a hasty, careless, and reckless way
We may hear about a certain thing and immediately say that we like it or do not like it and that we will do this or that concerning it
Those who are sociable in a natural way are often well received, but those who walk in the spirit are often misunderstood
The reason for this is that God will not propitiate us only for our sins; He will propitiate us also for our sin
If we deal with the source of our sins and with our not being absolute for God, we also deal with our trespasses
Some of the blood is sprinkled on the wall of the altar, signifying the sprinkling of Christ's blood upon sinners
For propitiation there is the need of the shedding of blood, but in Leviticus 5:11 fine flour is used for a sin offering
The trespass offering not only includes the sin offering and the burnt offering, but it even refers to the humanity of Jesus
The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour offered for a sin offering signifies that only a small portion of the humanity of Jesus is needed
The remainder of the fine flour for the trespass offering being the priest's signifies that the redeeming Christ is the serving one's food
Such a person needs a ram without blemish out of the flock according to the valuation by the shekel of the sanctuary for a trespass offering
The one sinning against the holy things of God needs to make restitution and add to it one-fifth more and give it to the priest
Everyone wants to be somebody, but if you would serve the Lord Jesus full-time, you must prepare yourself to be nobody, even to be ashes
What is offered to God as a burnt offering must be on the place of burning, not on the place of anything glorious or high
Eventually, the outcome of such a life, a life of suffering, a life without a future and without security, will be a heap of ashes
The continual burning of the fire also signifies that God's desire to accept what is offered to Him never ceases
Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place'
In carrying the ashes outside the camp, the priest wore stately garments and carried the ashes in a stately way
What we do must result in the building up of the Body of Christ, which is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem
In resurrection, the ashes become precious materials-gold, pearls, and precious stones-for the building of the New Jerusalem
The priest shall arrange the burnt offering on it; and he shall offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it'
In its spiritual significance, the peace offering implies fellowship with the Triune God and includes the enjoyment of the Triune God
We should not deceive ourselves but consider whether we have the necessary foundation for us to enjoy the Triune God
If we have such a foundation, then, whether we feel like we are enjoying the Lord or not, we are enjoying Him in reality
If we live a loose life day by day, yet feel that we are enjoying the Lord, we deceive ourselves, because our enjoyment has no foundation
Leviticus 6:12b also signifies that on the foundation of the burnt offering our peace offering should be burned for a fragrance to God
Not only the foundation should be burned, but even the very peace, the very fellowship, we enjoy should also be burned
Leviticus 6:14 says, 'This is the law of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah in front of the altar'
The meal offering being offered before Jehovah signifies that the meal offering is offered to God in His presence
The meal offering is offered to God in His presence, but it must be offered in relation to the redemption of Christ on the cross
Eating the priests' portion of the meal offering in a holy place signifies that we enjoy Christ as our meal offering without sin
Eating the meal offering in the court of the tent of meeting signifies enjoying Christ in the sphere of the church
Our enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering must be holy, it must be in a sanctified realm, and it must be in the sphere of the church life
We may be engaged in different kinds of proper employment, but we can still do our work in the sense of being priests to God
Nearly every chapter concerns the life, living, need, and supply of the priests and all the other things related to them
The meal offering may not be as real to us as it was to Paul, because only to a small degree is our life actually the life of a priest
Not baking the meal offering with leaven signifies that our working on Christ as our life supply must be without sin
Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat of it it is their perpetual due throughout your generations from the offerings of Jehovah by fire
When we hear that we need to be strong in life to partake of the meal offering, we may be disappointed, feeling that we are disqualified
According to this particular statute in the law of the meal offering, we are not qualified to partake of the meal offering
No matter how much we may think we have the daily enjoyment of Christ, we actually have not enjoyed Him that much
The males among the sons of Aaron eating of the meal offering also signifies that the partakers of Christ should be Gods serving onespriests
In such a case, we may think that we have this enjoyment, but our thought does not correspond to the actual situation
We need to remember that the first three offerings-the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering-bring us into the light
Whether we are old or young, whether we have been saved for many years or for a few months, we need to be enlightened
Since we are children of light, we must be in the light to be clear first concerning ourselves and then concerning God's economy
As descendants of Adam we have a fallen life, a lawless life unwilling to be ruled, governed, or controlled by anyone
Whereas the fallen, natural life is lawless, the divine life within us is absolutely according to law and regulation
In our enjoyment of Christ as the burnt offering, we need to realize that Christ is a life and this life has a law
If we were to write a law concerning elderly people, that law would have to correspond to the life of elderly people
In verse 16 Paul goes on to tell us that the way to receive mercy and peace is to 'walk by this rule,' the rule of the new creation
These three portions of the New Testament all indicate the same thing-that in the enjoyment of grace we need to be ruled
It signifies that Christ was offered to God as our sin offering based upon His being the burnt offering to God
Here God requires His people to slaughter the sin offering before Him in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered
The sin offering deals not only with the sin in our conduct outwardly but also with the sin in our nature intrinsically
When we minister Christ to others in this way, both we and the ones we are serving will enjoy Christ as the sin offering
If we would go to preach Christ as the sin offering to others, we must be dealt with, either by being broken or by being scoured and rinsed
Concerning Christ as the sin offering, there is a portion that is only for God, and there is a portion for us to share
He testified that from this practice he received the best nourishment, edification, knowledge, and building up in his Christian life
He also rose up in the morning to spend time with the Lord in the Word, and he testified of the nourishment he received
When we were regenerated, we received another life-the divine life, the life of God-which is different from our natural life
Whether our natural life is good or bad, we need to forget that life and go along with the second life, the divine life
In this second life there is a law that corresponds to the five laws in Leviticus 6 and 7 concerning the enjoyment of Christ in five aspects
You may then have felt that it was better to use the time to pray, and something within you-the sense of the divine life-would agree
After further consideration, you may have the desire to visit your cousin to preach the gospel, and the inner sense may agree
Praying and preaching the gospel are both good and holy things; however, the inner sense may agree with the latter and not with the former
If you were adopted by the president, surely you would decide spontaneously to live and act like a child of the president
We need to realize that we are children of the Lord of the whole universe, the One who is much higher than the president
Although we are the children of God, we may come to the meetings of the church in either a proper or an improper way
Some may feel that this is too legal, but here in the type we do have the laws, the regulations, for the enjoyment of Christ
The trespass offering also refers us to the burnt offering, reminding us that we commit sins because we are not fully and wholly for God
Since the trespass offering refers us to the sin offering and the burnt offering, we should not take the trespass offering in a light way
If Christ were not absolute for God, Christ would not be qualified to be our sin offering and trespass offering
Being absolute for God is the foundation, the base, for our Savior's being our sin offering and trespass offering
To minister Christ as the trespass offering to a brother who has committed sins requires that you be a stronger one
The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has offered'
When we serve others with Christ, we share a particular part of Christ-His 'hide,' which signifies His enveloping power
To envelop something is to wrap it with some kind of covering, and this covering serves as a protection to that thing
We experience Christ as our covering, protecting, and preserving power when we minister Him as the burnt offering to others
Because we have a thick hide covering and preserving us, we are protected in every way, and nothing will hurt us
We see that these meal offerings with which the priest served eventually became his to enjoy for the priesthood
But every other meal offering, whether mingled with oil or dry, shall be for all of Aaron's sons, to all alike'
Both the Old Testament and the New Testament have warnings concerning the improper, or lawless, enjoyment of Christ
With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread'
The reason the peace offering for thanksgiving is the weakest kind of peace offering is that it includes leaven
The peace offering for thanksgiving is a weaker offering, and its enjoyment cannot be carried from one day to the next
As priests, in our eating we need to be concerned about God's food and should not eat the fat, which is God's portion
When we are practicing our priestly service, we are serving God, and we should consider not our own things but God's things
The fat, the top portion of the offerings, must not be eaten by the priests but must be offered to God for His satisfaction
Whoever eats the fat of a beast from which an offering by fire is offered to Jehovah, the person who eats shall be cut off from his people'
He from among Aaron's sons who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, he shall have the right thigh for a portion'
We have been anointed by God to be priests, and God has allotted to us Christ's loving capacity and strengthening power
Christ is our burnt offering, meal offering, sin offering, and trespass offering so that we may enjoy Him as peace
In Leviticus 1-7 we have two records: a record according to experience and a record according to God's economy in its totality
Under Christ's redemption, we are enjoying Christ as a totality, and this totality is peace, which implies rest, enjoyment, and satisfaction
For the priesthood, which refers both to the priestly service and to a body of persons who are priests, we need to be washed by the Spirit
He placed the turban upon his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown'
Because in Christ the divine attributes were mingled with the human virtues, His love, kindness, and mercy are extraordinary
As we contact others, we need to impress them with the expression of Christ, that is, with the Christ with whom we are clothed
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them'
In the Bible, the tabernacle typifies Christ as an individual , and it also typifies the church as the dwelling place of God
The anointing of the tabernacle signifies the anointing of the church, in which we, the New Testament priests, serve God
The church, the cross, and the washing of the Spirit are all provisions for our practical consecration to be the priests today
Formerly, we were common; that is, we were not different from our relatives, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues
Regardless of our background, we all need to be sanctified, for we have consecrated ourselves to God, and He has ordained us
All the elements of the anointing oil, the compound Spirit, with the sin offering and the burnt offering must be constituted into our being
Leviticus 8:12 tells us that Moses 'poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him to sanctify him'
Aaron had been anointed with the anointing oil which signifies that the Triune God with all that He is has done and will do was now Aarons
Concerning our life and work, we need to ask ourselves whether the one moving, acting, and doing things is the old man or God's priest
Even in loving others we need to be reminded that we are sin flesh the old man and the old creation and that we are filled with worldliness
If we love others according to our flesh taste and choice our love is sinful in the eyes of God for such a love is linked to the evil one
As we pray and share in the meetings, we may have thoughts that come from the flesh, where sin is hidden and where Satan moves secretly
We need the sin offering not only at the time of our ordination as priests but also every time we practice our priesthood
As ordained priests of God we should therefore receive His mercy and grace to be absolute for God in Christ with Christ and through Christ
Aaron needed this offering because God wanted Aaron to be reminded that he should be absolute for God yet he was not
We may be familiar with the words 'live Christ,' but we may not understand the real significance of living Christ
The service of the New Testament priesthood includes functioning in the meetings preaching the gospel and visiting the saints in their homes
If his wife speaks to him in a negative way, he will be poisoned and deadened and will find it hard to pray in the church meeting
Because we often hear unclean things, things that are unhealthy and contagious, we need to wash our ears with the blood of Christ
If we do not take care of our hearing but give ear to negative speaking, our deeds and work will be affected in a negative way
The fat signifies the portion of Christ that is for God, and the right thigh signifies Christ as our strength to stand
Verse 27 says, 'Then he put all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah'
Whenever we, the serving ones, minister Christ to others, we deserve to enjoy the very Christ we minister to them
Now that we have been saved and ordained as God's priests, His servants, the primary thing is to listen to God's speaking
If we listen to God's word from morning to evening, we will not have an ear to listen to any negative speaking
Negative talk prevails and spreads in the church life because certain ones turn their ears from God to something else
If we turn our ears from other things back to God Himself, there will not be any problems, and only life will be spreading, not death
In 82628 we see that one unleavened cake one cake of oiled bread and one wafer were placed upon the portions of the fat and the right thigh
We may proclaim the fact that we are God's priests, but probably none among us ever realized how many matters are involved in being a priest
We need the cleansing blood on the tip of our right ear, on our right thumb, and on the big toe of our right foot
The anointing oil refers to the processed Triune God with all that He has become, has done, and has passed through
If we understand the typology of this book, we will see that point after point applies to us in a practical way today
Verse 32 indicates that the Christ whom we offer to God for His enjoyment and whom we also enjoy is inexhaustible
The consecrating priests remained at the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days for their propitiation
Everyone was aware of the seriousness of what was taking place and of what might happen if anyone was careless
If we eat the bread and drink the wine without the proper discernment, our eating and drinking could be to our own judgment
We need to be warned of the seriousness of participating in the fellowship in the enjoyment of Christ in a light or loose way
As God's priests today, we also need to remember all the things involved in our consecration and ordination as priests
The consecration of Aaron and his sons is solemn not only in its typology but also in its application to us today
If we realize the seriousness of this matter, we will also realize how much we need the Lord's mercy and the cleansing of His blood
In Leviticus, after the erecting of the tabernacle, God had a dwelling place on earth from within which He spoke to His people
The offerings were now offered to God not by an individual but by a people, a congregation, and not at the place of their choice
God asked the people to come to the entrance of the tent of meeting to contact Him and to offer their offerings by priests not by themselves
Let us now consider the record in Leviticus 9:1-21 regarding the initiation of the priestly service of Aaron and his sons
The initiation of the priestly service of Aaron and his sons took place on the eighth day , which signifies resurrection
The eighth day in Leviticus 9:1 refers to the day after the seven days of the consecration of Aaron and his sons
Such things are not on the eighth day; that is, they are not in the realm of resurrection but in the realm of the natural life
In the New Testament, on the contrary, there is a concern regarding natural love, which is actually a kind of 'honey'
Anything we do outside the Spirit, in our natural life, mind, or emotion, is not on the eighth day, not in resurrection
Quite often the Lord will require us to love someone whom we cannot love in our natural life and with our natural love
Redemption was completed by the Lord Jesus' death on the cross and this term should be used only for the New Testament
Atonement is a matter of atonement it refers to appeasing the situation between two parties in order to bring them together to make them one
Christ not only shed His blood to accomplish redemption, but in His ascension He entered into the heavens and presented His blood before God
The blood of the sin offering shed on the day of propitiation was sprinkled on the lid of the ark for the making of propitiation
He had a problem with God, and he needed to do something to appease the situation so that he could have peace with God
As we confess our mistakes, failures, and wrongdoings, we spontaneously take Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering
We will offer the top portion to God as His food, and we will feed on Christ as our daily food, as our daily life supply
We will be brought into a sense of peace, into a tranquil situation, and enjoy Christ as our peace, rest, satisfaction, and comfort
Unable to deny the sense that God has appeared to us, we will want to worship and adore Him, offering to Him our praise and thanksgiving
In our gospel preaching we may apply Christ as the offerings, and as a result we enjoy the appearing of God to us
Perhaps a particular meeting is not very living, but then someone offers a living prayer, and the meeting is resurrected and revived
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul wrote concerning the glory of the Old Testament ministry and the glory of the New Testament ministry
For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
With Moses, who had the Old Testament ministry of death and condemnation, there was a glory, a physical glory, on his face
We who have the ministry of the New Testament, of the Spirit and of righteousness, have a glory in life and in spirit
On another occasion He may stir up everyone in the meeting, and all the attendants will have the sense that God is stirring them up
When we minister Christ as the different offerings, we enjoy Him, and those to whom we minister also enjoy Him
At that time, the Spirit might have shown us that we are sin, even leprous, and that we cannot be absolute for God
If we would enjoy this allinclusive person we need to apply Him daily as our sin offering burnt offering meal offering and peace offering
If we apply Him as the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering, we will have the blessing we need
Even if we are hated, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, we should bless those who persecute us and pray that the Lord will forgive them
Anything that does not meet the requirements of God's holiness will be judged by God's holiness through burning
After we enjoy God's presence, the appearing of His glory, and the Lord's blessing, we should be prepared to receive the consuming fire
The same fire, which is the representative of God's holiness, may either be a consuming fire for God's acceptance or a judging fire
To us today, the consuming fire may be a divine acceptance of our offering to God, or it may be God's judgment due to our offenses
If we offend God's government and a burning comes to us, this burning is God's judgment upon us for touching His government
In a positive situation, when we have something for God and offer it to God, He accepts it by consuming it with fire
Such a negative case-the case of Nadab and Abihu-is found in Leviticus 10:1-11, the section which we will consider in this message
That consuming was a strong confirmation that God is the true and living God and that He was with His people, the people of Israel
Now there was a particular day with all kinds of laws, regulations, and offerings, a day that was formal and official
In chapter nine the holy fire consumed in the sense of accepting; in chapter ten the holy fire consumed in the sense of judging
Concerning Nadab and Abihu, 10:2 says, 'Fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah'
On the day of Pentecost the glory of God came down from heaven but not long afterward a couple cheated the Holy Spirit and died as a result
In the case in Leviticus 10, the offering of something not sanctified, a common, worldly fire, brought in judgment
The consuming of Nadab and Abihu probably took place at the end of the day of glory and blessing described in chapter nine
Now in our Christian life and walk we need to hold the attitude that our natural man has been crucified and must be set aside
We need to realize that our natural man has been judged by God on the cross, and for this reason it should not be regarded or honored
If we speak in the meetings in a natural way, we will offer strange, or common, fire, and this will bring in spiritual death
Whenever we testify in a natural way, our being is deadened, and the meeting with its atmosphere also is deadened
To offer strange fire to God is to do the right thing in the wrong way, and this brings in the judgment of death
Moses said that 'the days of our years are threescore years and ten' and that 'by reason of strength' they may be fourscore years
Due to the influence of Catholicism and Protestantism many Christians today are loose and careless concerning the worship and service of God
They do not take this worship and service seriously, and the result is the exercise of the natural life issuing in spiritual death
Leviticus 10:2 tells us that 'fire came out from before Jehovah' and consumed Nadab and Abihu, and 'they died before Jehovah'
Their death tells us that God is not common but holy and that we should not offer anything common to this holy God
If we are not serious with Him, we will be judged, and His judgment upon us will be His sanctification of Himself
Even if relatives are lost due to God's death-judgment, we must take care of God's concern and not our own concern
Behaving in such a situation as though we have suffered no loss shows that we are under the headship of Christ
Leviticus 10:6c says, 'But let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah has kindled'
And you shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting so that you may not die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you'
According to 1 Corinthians 11:27-32, this kind of judgment is a disciplinary punishment, a merciful correction, not a judgment for perdition
According to Leviticus 2, the top portion of the meal offering, with the frankincense, was to be offered to God by fire
As the meal offering, Christ is firstly for God's satisfaction, and then He is for our enjoyment and satisfaction
After this death-judgment Moses did not say, 'Aaron, you have made mistakes, and now is the time for you to offer a sin offering to God'
Also, the meal offering was to be eaten without sin as an offering that could be accepted by God in the fire of His holiness
The breast and the thigh were to be eaten in a clean place, signifying a clean condition apart from sin or any negative thing
The goal of such a dealing is to appease the situation of the believers with God and to restore their broken fellowship with God
The word propitiation in the Old Testament does not refer to the redemption accomplished and completed by Christ
The noun form of this word is rendered 'propitiatory cover' in 16:2, 13-15, and refers to the lid of the ark of the testimony
On the day of propitiation the animal was slain, and its shed blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the lid of the ark
The accomplished and completed redemption of Christ was obtained when He brought His blood to the heavens and sprinkled it there
Redemption was accomplished by Christ on the cross, and it was obtained by Christ the Redeemer from the hand of the redeeming God
What we receive today is not merely propitiation or some kind of appeasing but the accomplished and completed redemption
If we would take Christ as the sin offering, we need to realize that after eating such a Christ we should bear the problems of God's people
If you become aware that a certain brother has a problem with sin, you should first bear the burden to pray for him
If we contact others in this way, we will not damage them or the church but rather will do something to bear the problems of God's people
Due to his weakness concerning God's death-judgment upon Nadab and Abihu, Aaron and his sons were not fit to eat the sin offering
He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons who remained, and said, Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place'?
Since the blood of this sin offering had not been brought inside, into the holy place, they should have eaten it as Moses had commanded
Aaron told Moses that because of their sorrow, it would not have been fitting for them to eat the sin offering
They had not followed the divine regulation, not because of disobedience but because of a positive consideration of their circumstances
What Aaron and his sons did was seemingly against God's regulation, but actually it was something done in wisdom
In the book of Hebrews there are many references to the book of Leviticus, especially to the offerings and the priesthood
In Leviticus we can see that all the offerings typify Christ, but we do not get the realization and the sense of how great Christ is
Hebrews 1:2 and 3 tell us that Christ is the Maker, the Creator, of the universe and that He is also the Upholder of the universe He created
The wonderful One, who is the Maker of the universe, partook of blood and flesh in order to destroy the Devil, to bring him to naught
As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of the divine life, nature, and fullness
As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case may be fully cared for by Him
414 and 15 say Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast the confession
He is the bondsman, the guarantee that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant
For such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens'
Having passed through the heavens and even being higher than the heavens , the Lord Jesus is always living to intercede for us
He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
By sprinkling His blood in the heavens before God, Christ has found, obtained, procured, eternal redemption for us
Christ appeared the first time to take away our sin and our sins, and He will appear a second time apart from sin
Hebrews 10:5-10 tells us that when Christ came, God had no more desire for or pleasure and interest in the animal sacrifices
God prepared a human body for Christ, the incarnated God-man , so that He could be the replacement of all the Old Testament offerings
He is now the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
He is also the wave offering, the heave offering, the consecration offering, the freewill offering, and the offering for thanksgiving
When we do this, the Father may say, 'A portion of this gift is for you and for all your brothers and sisters to enjoy'
The central thought of Leviticus is that the universal, all-inclusive, and inexhaustible Christ is everything to God and to God's people
The second section, comprising chapters eleven through twenty-seven, covers the holy living of God's holy people
All the matters in chapters eleven through twenty-seven concerning the holy living of God's holy people should also be regarded as types
The vision of a 'certain vessel like a great sheet' in which were all kinds of animals was a fulfillment of Leviticus 11
In particular, we are indebted to the Brethren, who were raised up by the Lord in England a century and a half ago
One extremely difficult point is found in 11:3a, which speaks of whatever 'divides the hoof and is cloven-footed'
In other words, the scholars who prepared that translation thought that to divide the hoof was to be cloven-footed
All these animals bear a great significance, for they typify persons; they are figures that describe different kinds of persons
Once a thing is received into us, that thing can be digested inside to become our constituent, that is, our being, our constitution
If we intend to live a holy life as required by the holy God, we need to be careful about our contact with people
Our contact with certain kinds of people can cause us to be reconstituted and thus make us another kind of person
Whatever we contact we will receive, and whatever we receive will reconstitute us, making us a different kind of person from what we are now
All creeping things are unclean, but in the other four categories some animals are clean and others are unclean
Aquatic animals having fins and scales signify persons who can move and act freely in the world and at the same time resist its influence
As believers in Christ we should have fins and scales and therefore be able to act freely in the sea of the world without being salted by it
When some hear this, they may say, 'What about preaching the gospel to people by visiting them in their homes?
We should live and move in a life that is away from and above the world and that we should take the things of life as our supply of life
If we have contact with unclean birds, we shall be influenced by their taste and eventually that will turn us into an unclean bird
If we are the kind of persons signified by these insects, we shall have wings for flying away from anything worldly, sinful, or fleshly
The evil spirits are fallen angels, and the demons are disembodied spirits of creatures from the pre-Adamic age
We should not contact persons possessed by demons or persons who cleave to the world, lest we be brought under their influence
We need to know the four categories of clean living creatures and the five categories of unclean living creatures
When we are about to have contact with a particular person, we need to consider whether he is clean or unclean
Our God is high, yet He lowered Himself to become a vine, spreading Himself to reach the four corners of the earth
The Bible not only begins with the tree of life in Genesis but also consummates with the tree of life in Revelation
Verse 14 of that chapter goes on to say, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life'
In a very real sense, therefore, in the church life we are in the paradise of God enjoying Christ as our tree of life
When God placed Adam in the garden, He knew that in this universe there was also another source-God's enemy, Satan
There is not only one source-God as the source of life; there is also a second source-Satan as the source of death
If we do not have the right concept concerning death, it will not be easy for us to realize that death is more defiling than sin
We should give something to a brother not with the purpose of pleasing him but simply because we are following the Lord's leading
Suppose one's intention in giving a book to a brother is to please the brother so that he will then stand with the one who gave him the book
A deed like the giving of a book may have a very good appearance but may actually be filled with the uncleanness of death
If we commit a trespass and then confess it to the Lord, we shall be forgiven immediately, and the matter is settled
Time is not a factor in being forgiven of our sins, but it is a factor in being cleansed from the defilement of death
If we touch a 'carcass' and are thereby defiled by death, this defilement will remain with us for quite a period of time
Although it does not take time for us to be cleansed from sin, it does take time for us to be cleansed from the defilement of death
Anything upon which the carcass of any animal falls is unclean, and anything thus defiled shall be washed in water
Our natural man, our being, our self, which has been defiled by death, needs to be broken by the cross of Christ
Any food in the earthen vessel upon which water comes and any drink in the vessel shall be made unclean by the fallen carcass
The spring of living water signifies the Spirit, and the cistern of the living water signifies Christ, who holds the living water
As long as we have the spring and the cistern, the Spirit and Christ, in our daily life, we shall remain clean
When He was on earth, He could live and move in a life that was above the world, and He could keep Himself from the world
The fact that the human birth coming out of the woman is unclean signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean
If we are under the Lord's enlightenment, under the divine light, we shall realize that from head to toe we are a totality of uncleanness
In contrast to the uncleanness in diet dealt with in chapter eleven, which is from without, the uncleanness of mankind is from within
Chapter eleven covers outward uncleanness, but chapter twelve covers inward uncleanness, the uncleanness of our entire being from birth
Chapter eleven simply charges us to live a clean life by contacting what is clean and by avoiding what is unclean
The 'seven days' in verse 2 signify fully unclean, unclean in full, and the 'two weeks' in verse 5a signify twice this uncleanness
The children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, and the Lord Jesus was tempted, that is, tested, for forty days
During the test of the uncleanness, the woman was not allowed to touch any holy thing or go into the sanctuary
We should be full of joy whenever we come across the words 'the eighth day' or 'the first day of the week' in our reading of the Bible
Whether we are saved early in life or at an advanced age, in the sight of God our first course is only a week in length
To be circumcised is to be cut; it is to have that part of our being which is condemned in the sight of God cut off
As a result, we have been brought into the resurrection of Christ, not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life
Christ died for us to terminate our first course and, on the eighth day, to begin our new course in His resurrection
After we have been dealt with through His death and resurrection, we still need Him to be our burnt offering and our sin offering
In Leviticus 12 Christ is indicated by four matters: the eighth day, circumcision, the burnt offering, and the sin offering
Now in this new course He is our life and our living, for He is our burnt offering, a life that is absolute for God
In Leviticus 11 we see that we need discernment in diet, discernment in eating; that is, we must be careful in what we contact and receive
Being a sinner has nothing to do with what we contact outwardly; rather, being a sinner is a matter of our birth
We may say that leprosy originates from outside a person, that it is caused by the entering into a person of the germs of leprosy
We need to ask ourselves about what we contact, about our birth, and about leprosy with its outward factor and inward effect
If we cannot solve the problems we have related to these things, it will be impossible for us to live a holy life
In order to live a holy life, we must deal with our contact with things, with our birth, and with our leprous condition
Leprosy signifies the serious sin issuing from within man, such as willful sin, presumptuous sin, and opposing God with determination
The leprosy issues from within one's being, as illustrated by three Old Testament cases-the cases of Miriam, Gehazi, and Uzziah
In each of these three cases, the leprosy first entered into the rebellious one and then issued from within that one
Leprosy now issues in many different kinds of sins, that is, in many expressions, manifestations, of rebellion
The Lord Jesus and those who serve God, the serving priests, are qualified to examine one to determine whether or not he has leprosy
The hair turning white signifies that the strength for behavior, the strength to live a normal life, is deteriorating
If the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn
Justifying ourselves that is excusing ourselves and not confessing our failures mistakes and wrongdoings is a symptom of spiritual leprosy
It is difficult for us fallen human beings to forgive others, but it is easy for us to remember those who have offended us
Sometimes we may seem to forgive our brothers and sisters in the Lord, but we forgive without forgetting the offense
We remember the offense and may even talk to others about it, all the while claiming that we have forgiven the offending party
Our person, our heart, our mind, our emotion, our intention, our motive, our purpose-all these will be tested by the church life
As our sin offering, Christ takes care of our sin, not the sin before we were saved but the sin that we still have after our salvation
Before we go to sleep at night, we should have a time of confession before the Lord, asking Him to forgive our sins and impurities
We should take Him once again as our sin offering and trespass offering and apply His precious, cleansing blood to our situation
With a purged conscience, a conscience cleansed by the blood and by the Spirit, we shall be able to sleep in peace
According to the principles set up by God in His creation, everything is in order and is related to a certain kind of authority
A disease on the head signifies something wrong in the subjection to authority and in the thinking of the mind
A disease on the beard signifies considering oneself as somebody, being self-dignifying, hunting for others' exaltation
The one speaking may assume dignity by trying to make a display of how learned, knowledgeable, and eloquent he is
Spiritually speaking, if we are strong in our spirit to live a proper and normal Christian life, we shall have black hair
Such hair is a sign of rebellion against God; it indicates that, at least in certain things, one is not submissive or obedient to God's word
Shaving the beard but not the hair signifies dealing with considering oneself as somebody, with self-dignifying, etc
Washing the clothes signifies dealing with the stains of weak points in conduct offenses defects words of rebellion and improper activities
If the bright spots in the skin of their flesh are a dull white, it is a tetter that has broken out in the skin; he is clean'
The forehead being bald signifies being neither in subjection to authority nor in rebellion before men and on public occasions
His disheveled hair is a sign of his unruliness; it indicates that he is disorderly and that he does not care for regulations and rules
Covering the upper lip indicates that whatever issues out of a leper is filthy and contagious and that he should not be contacted
In studying Leviticus 13, a chapter full of types and figures, we need the proper knowledge and understanding of the Bible as a whole
As signified by these three kinds of garments, our conduct should be in meekness, in plainness, and in warmness
Our conduct in our daily walk is actually a matter of interweaving, that is, a condition which involves both God and man
The greenish or reddish appearance in the garment signifies the abnormal and strange change in one's living and conduct
Sometimes instead of such a strong dealing, we need another kind of dealing-the dealing signified by washing a garment
Washing the garment, the disease of which has not spread, signifies dealing with the suspected weakness in one's living and conduct
If we would live a holy life we need a daily washing, and this washing comes through our repentance and confession
In our family life the parents should be willing, when they have offended their children, to tell them that they are sorry
In order to live a holy life, we need to know the things concerning discernment in diet, concerning our birth, and concerning our condition
Verse 57 speaks of the disease breaking out again in the garment after the diseased spot has been torn out of the garment
Chapters thirteen and fourteen of Leviticus cover the matter of sin in more detail than any other chapters in the Bible
We need to repent of our failures, confess our mistakes, and deal with our failures and mistakes, seeking even to eliminate them
We need to live a life of repentance and confession, a life of dealing with our shortcomings and eliminating them by the cross of Christ
When we speak it is very easy for us to say something sinful, something that requires our repentance and confession
In Leviticus 12 we see that we are a totality of uncleanness, and in Leviticus 13, that we are a totality of leprosy
Now we come to the matter of cleansing, which is the all-inclusive salvation God has prepared and accomplished for us
The birds in verse 4a signify that Christ came from the heavens and that He belongs to the heavens and transcends the earth
Christ rose from among the dead for us that we might be delivered from our weakness by the power, strength, and energy of life
In 1 Kings 4:33 Solomon 'spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall'
The earthen vessel signifies the Lord's humanity, and the living water signifies the living and eternal Spirit of God
When He was dying on the cross, He offered Himself to God through the living water-the eternal, living Spirit of God-that filled Him
In 14:6 four things-the other bird, the cedar wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop-were dipped in the blood of the killed bird
The Lord's redemption, His noble, high, and lowly humanity, and His resurrection, ascension, and glorification are all implied in this type
We have seen that the cedar wood typifies Christ's noble and high humanity, and the hyssop, His lowly humanity
We have been redeemed by the crucified Christ, and now we are in the resurrected Christ, soaring in the air with Him
He who is to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean'
These are man's naturally good and strong points, which do not issue from the experience of God's salvation but from one's natural birth
Added together these five items equal getting rid of the self with all its glory honor excellencies merits virtues strength and ability
Leviticus 14:9 says, 'And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows-even all his hair
After watching and waiting for seven days, he shaved his entire body once more, washed his clothes, and bathed his flesh
If we simply read and understand the New Testament, we shall not have a clear, detailed picture of what is involved in this cleansing
From the types we see that to cleanse us of our leprosy the Lord had to be incarnated, to become a human being
Now we can see that for our cleansing we need a Christ of many aspects, a Christ who has gone through a number of processes
The blood shed by Him has been sprinkled upon us, and this sprinkling connects us, the sinners, to Christ, the Redeemer
Although the Lord has shown us much concerning these types, we hope that in the coming years He will show us even more
The previous message covered only the first part of the procedure, or the process, of the cleansing of a leper
The nature of our fallen being is sin, and this sinful nature is the essence, the substance, the element, of Satan
The trespass offering deals with our sins which are the issues of the sin within us the sin which is our nature our being our constitution
The sin offering and the trespass offering are actually of one category to deal with sin in total, including our sin and our sins
A third party comes in to act on behalf of the first party to remove the offense so that the second party can be one with the first party
A leper, a sinner who is under God's condemnation and who has a problem with God, needs three things: healing, cleansing, and propitiating
In order to make propitiation He had to be our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, and meal offering
The more we enjoy Christ as the meal offering, the more we shall live a life that is a burnt offering absolute for God
Through these four kinds of offerings the problem between us and God is fully solved, and the situation between us and God is appeased
In 14:10-32 we see that the leper who was to be cleansed needed to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God
He shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered, in the holy place'
The blood is applied to the tip of the right ear, to the thumb of the right hand, and to the great toe of the right foot
Having the Spirit poured upon our head will help us to subject ourselves to God's authority, taking Him as our head
Christ is our burnt offering and our meal offering that we may have the life supply to live a life which is absolutely for God
Based upon the principle that Leviticus is written in the form of types, we may interpret the house in 14:33-53 as a type of the church
When the church becomes leprous, sick because of sins and evils, we have the sense that we have lost our home, that we have become homeless
Since there is no longer a proper church, we are no longer able to enjoy all the blessings God has promised in His salvation
Putting other stones in the place of the removed stones signifies the using of other believers to fill up the gap
In dealing with the leprosy in a house, it is not adequate to remove certain believers and then fill the gap with other believers
We need to have a new start in the church life, that is, to renew the church with new experiences of the Lord's gracious works
The leading ones need to pray perhaps with fasting that the church will receive something new in the experiences of Christs gracious works
The church life will be renewed, replastered with new mortar, and all the members will be happy about the renewed church life
If the situation of a church reaches the point where it cannot be cured, healed, then it will be necessary for that church to be terminated
If we pay attention fully to the problems, there will either be more problems or the problems will be intensified
We should try our best to end the old day of the diseased church life and to help the church to have a new beginning
And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes'
Lying down is an indication that one is indifferent to the church life or that one is not positively in the church service
Although these saints are not positively engaged in the church service, having no heart for this, they are good at criticizing others
We need to ask the Lord to be merciful to us that none of us will be those lying down or caring only for our eating
Leviticus 14:49-51 reveals the leprosy in a house is cleansed in the same way as the cleansing of leprosy in a man
In order for a church to be cleansed, the church needs to experience again the processes through which the Lord Jesus has passed
The blood of the bird signifies the blood of Christ, the water signifies the cleansing Spirit, and the oil signifies the anointing Spirit
When the church enjoys Christ's resurrection and ascension, the church is above the earth, enjoying freedom in the heavens
When the honeymoon is over, our eyes will be opened to see all the problems, defects, and shortcomings in the church
In this message on 15:1-31 we shall cover the matter of the cleansing of the discharges from man's and woman's body
We have pointed out that chapters eleven through twentyseven of Leviticus intend to give us the way to live a holy life as Gods holy people
No matter what kind of person we may be, we all have discharges, and, as chapter fifteen shows us, these discharges are altogether unclean
The intention of God's revelation in the five chapters that come between chapters ten and sixteen is to show us four basic troubling factors
Contacting the wrong kinds of persons can cause us to be defiled and thus discredit us in the matter of a holy living as God's holy people
In 15:1-13 we see that the one who has a discharge is unclean and anything or anyone he touches becomes unclean
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that whatever issues from us is unclean and should be condemned and eliminated
After reading 15:1-13, we may wonder where we can stay without being defiled by the uncleanness of human discharges
Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge he is unclean'
We need the cross of Christ to end our old life, and we need the resurrection of Christ to have a new beginning
After we touch this washing element in the word, we shall continue to be cleansed in our being by it throughout the day
We need the cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the Holy Spirit as the water of life in the word of God
Again we would emphasize our need of the cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, and the holy Word
The earthenware vessel which he who has the discharge touches shall be broken; and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water'
As Gods created people however we do not need to be broken yet we do need to be rinsed with the Spirit the divine life and the holy Word
The function of Christ as the burnt offering is to be our life that we may live a life that is absolute for God
In typology this means that if we still have the defilement that comes from the issue of the natural life, we shall defile the church life
It may be rather easy to stay away from leprosy, but it is not easy to stay away from the effects of human discharges
If we stay in Christ's death, resurrection, Spirit, life, and word, we shall have a proper Christian life and church life
Day by day we shall live a revived life and an overcoming life in the death, resurrection, Spirit, life, and word of Christ
The Hebrew word translated 'propitiation' in Leviticus 16 means to cover; it has the same root as the word for the cover of the ark
How could a sinful person approach and converse with the One who is love and light and who is righteous and holy?
For this reason, our situation needs to be appeased by the cover that is placed over the condemning, judging commandments
In preaching the gospel, some have said that God is angry with us, but that Jesus, our Friend, asks God to do Him a favor and forgive us
He has loved us to such an extent that in eternity past He prepared a way first to cover our sins and then to remove them
In the Old Testament God's economy was to cover man's sins; in the New Testament God's economy is to take away man's sins
The glory of God was watching over the Ten Commandments, waiting to see what the holy and righteous God would do with the approaching sinner
A cover was inserted to cover the Ten Commandments so that the glory of God could not see the Ten Commandments but could see only the cover
In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the word propitiation is used to denote the cover of the ark
To make atonement is to cause two parties to be one; it is to bring these parties into an at-one-ment, to make these parties one
The repetition of the offering was an indication that the taking away of sins for the accomplishment of redemption was yet to take place
Hebrews 105 says Wherefore coming into the world He says Sacrifice and offering You did not desire but a body You have prepared for Me
A body was prepared for Christ that He might be the real offering not to cover sin and sins but to take away the totality of sin
Chapters eleven through fifteen are very negative and show us what we are, where we are, what our condition is, and what issues out from us
Aaron shall enter into the holy of holies in this way: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering'
And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two bucks of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering'
The goat shall bear away on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness'
The goat that was for Jehovah was to be killed, but the goat that was for Satan, the Devil, was to be sent away
According to Hebrews 2:14, through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed 'him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil'
The cross gives Christ the position, the strength, the power, and the authority to take sin away and send it back to Satan
We all should rejoice in the word spoken by John the Baptist: 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
On the one hand, in God's redemption Christ is the offerings that we may be redeemed from sin and that our sins may be taken away from us
His being burned as the incense to be our acceptance before God depends on His death on the cross for our sins
In the second picture we see that Christ, based upon His death, is burnt as a fragrance to God for our acceptance
Now we have the eternal redemption, which brings us directly into the presence of God so that we may serve Him as the living God
In our worship of God there is still the consciousness of sin, which also needs the propitiation by the blood of Christ
Because we are still in the old creation and still live in uncleanness, we still have the consciousness of sin
While we are still in the old creation, we still have the consciousness of sin and need Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering
Whereas the blood sprinkled on the altar is for our peace, the blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover is for God's satisfaction
Verse 19b tells us that Aaron was to cleanse the altar and 'sanctify it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel'
The word 'uncleannesses' in verse 19 refers to our sin, to our leprosy, to our rebellion, even to the satanic nature within us
Because the people of God were still in this uncleanness, even the altar used by God for the redemption of His people was contaminated
Verse 20a speaks of Aaron's finishing 'making propitiation for the holy of holies, the tent of meeting, and the altar'
The holy of holies, the most holy place in the universe, was contaminated by the uncleanness of God's redeemed people
From this we can see that the sin offering is for the burnt offering, that the sin offering is offered in view of the burnt offering
We have been redeemed so that, taking Christ as our life and life supply, we might become those who in Christ live absolutely for God
If Christ's redemption only removed our sin but did not enable us to live for God absolutely, His redemption would not be complete
He is our sin offering for the removal of our sins, and He is our burnt offering to make us those who are absolutely for God
We are accepted in Christ as the incense burned before God and also in Christ's heart, which is toward God and for Him
He who let the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and after that he may come into the camp'
He alone accomplished a perfect and eternal redemption on the cross, signified by the altar outside the tabernacle
When those in the denominations criticize and oppose our standing in the local churches, we bear the Lord's reproach
And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and after that he may come into the camp'
Verse 29a says This shall be a perpetual statute for you in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict yourselves
Complete redemption has been accomplished in a full way by Christ, and now we are enjoying it without any labor
In the preceding book, Exodus, the tabernacle was built up, the priesthood was set up, and, to some extent, the offerings were arranged
The next five chapters show us who and what the serving ones are what their origin condition and situation are and what comes out of them
The negative portrait in chapters eleven through fifteen is a background for presenting to us Christ as the One we need
In chapter sixteen we have a type, a shadow, of God's redemption, which, at the time this book was written, was still to come
Because the Old Testament time was not the time for redemption to take place, a type, shadow, of the coming redemption was needed
In chapter sixteen, the propitiation is fully applied, but the result of the four offerings-the peace offering-is not yet applied
It is one sacrifice in many aspects: the trespass offering, the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
We must care for the sacrifices and the blood; that is, we must care for the person of Christ and His redemptive work
In chapter seventeen of Leviticus, the Israelites were charged not to offer their sacrifices in any place they desired
Often we are reproached because we do not use a name to designate the church such as Episcopalian Lutheran Methodist Presbyterian or Baptist
To designate the church in this way is to denominate it, and this is to be abusive in the application of the sacrifices
Let us now consider in detail from Leviticus 17 the two matters of taking care of the sacrifices and of the blood
The sacrifices in 17:5 refer to the result of the sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, and meal offering
Otherwise, instead of being a pure virgin presented to Christ , we shall conduct ourselves like the great prostitute in Revelation 17
The burnt offering signifies Christ as our burnt offering to God, by whose life we can live absolutely for God
The religions in the world today are formed mainly with one of the two things typified in Leviticus 17:15a as the basis
From this we see that different beliefs, different religions, are based on different persons, that is, on different bloods
Speaking according to typology, nearly all the people have drunk a blood other than the blood of the Lord Jesus
If we applied Christ elsewhere, we would be prostituting ourselves, making ourselves into a prostitute who does not have a definite husband
Leviticus 17:15 tells us that the one who ate that which died of itself or was torn by beasts was to wash his clothes and bathe in water
Every sinner should believe only in Jesus Christ and take His blood for his redemption that he might be saved before God
The subject of this message is 'The Holy Living of God's Holy People-Putting Off the Old Life and Putting On the New'
In Old Testament terms Gods people were not to live according to the Egyptians among whom they once lived nor according to the Canaanites
They were to put off the old man with the old manner of life and to put on the new man with the new manner of life
Leviticus 18-20 is full of statutes and ordinances, which are explanations and extensions of the Ten Commandments
As a whole, the law is composed of the Ten Commandments plus the explanations and extensions of the Ten Commandments
In Leviticus 18-20 there is no repetition of the Ten Commandments, but there is the explanation and extension of the Ten Commandments
The Israelites were also charged not to walk in the customs of the Canaanites, into whose land they would come
When you sacrifice a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted'
Chapters eighteen through twenty are not concerned with propitiation but with the holy living of God's holy people
Concerning the holy living in Leviticus 18-20, we need to take care of the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering
It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire'
Our enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering for our fellowship with God and with one another should be fresh
In other words, we need a new washing, a new bathing in the Word or in the Spirit, so that we can have a fresh remembrance of the Lord
And he who eats it shall bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from his people'
The fact that no mixture was allowed indicates that God wants everything to be after its kind , without any kind of mixture
In both Catholicism and Pentecostalism there is the mixture of the things of the New Testament with certain things from the Old Testament
The garments worn by the cardinals in the Catholic Church are similar to the robes worn by the priests in the Old Testament
In Pentecostalism there is much prophesying in the Old Testament manner, with the speaker often saying, 'Thus saith the Lord'
Incest is the most destructive thing to humanity, and a lengthy section of these chapters is devoted to it in detail
We should not think that in the Lord's recovery we care only for Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church and not for ethics and morality
Although we have been regenerated into the holy priesthood we might still be disqualified from the priesthood in some ways even in many ways
As a holy people for God's holy priesthood, we must be careful not to touch anything that would defile us or profane us
They shall not make any baldness on their head, nor shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh'
To make our head bald indicates that we do not subject ourselves to God's headship, that we do not accept God's authority over us
As God's cooks, we should be a holy people, a people undefiled, so that we would not profane the name of our holy God
For us as God's priests today to wear the garments of consecration is for us to have a living that befits our priesthood
He had to remain in the priesthood as the high priest because of the sanctuary and because of the anointing oil that was upon him
All the points we have covered in this section are regulations for the living of a life that befits our priesthood
The people are somewhat ordinary, but the priests are altogether separated unto God, that is, sanctified, holy, to God
The priest with a blemish, that is, some kind of defect, was not allowed to come near to offer the food of his God
If we are short of Christ in His light, we shall not have the adequate sight, and this shortage will disqualify us from the priesthood
A defective sight signifies the sight in spiritual things that is not perfect because of the lack of a full view of Christ
Scabs signify something that causes oneself to be uncomfortable and in its appearance bothers others, because of a lack in living Christ
Both cause a saint to be uncomfortable and to have an appearance, an expression, that is troubling to others in the church life
There are such saints in the church, and often they cause trouble because of their 'itching' and abnormal expression
If we do not have the adequate experience of Christ as life, the organs for spiritual reproduction will be damaged
If, as New Testament priests, we have a blemish, a defect, this will disqualify us from doing the priestly service
We need to live a holy life, a life that befits our priesthood, and we need to keep ourselves complete, perfect, and properly balanced
Everything that the people offered to God is a type of Christ, whom God gives to us, the serving ones, for our enjoyment
If we are unclean or defiled in any way, we must have a thorough dealing, mainly by bathing, washing, ourselves in the Holy Spirit
No outsider shall eat of a holy thing; a sojourner of a priest or a hired servant shall not eat of a holy thing'
But if a priest buys a slave, the purchase of his money, that one may eat of it; and those who are born in his house may eat of his food'
Since we have been purchased by Christ and since we were born of God in His house, we are surely qualified to enjoy Christ
If he cuts off his relationship with the outsider without leaving any connection and returns to the church, he may still enjoy Christ
If we who belong to the priesthood are attracted by an outsider, we are finished with the priesthood and with the enjoyment of Christ
If a man eats a holy thing through ignorance, then he shall add one-fifth more to it and give the holy thing to the priest'
Now we shall consider from verses 18 through 33 the acceptable way for the offering of a vow and a freewill offering
We may wish to make up our mind to have a vow with God that we would be absolute for God for the rest of our life
Sometimes while we are enjoying Christ at the Lord's table, we may have the thought that we should be absolute for God
According to 22:18-21, each of these offerings needed to be a male without blemish, of the herd, of the sheep, or of the goats
In whatever way we offer a burnt offering to God, our offering must be a strong Christ without blemish whom we have experienced
Rather, we need to enjoy a Christ who is perfect, who is without defect, and who always bears a pleasant appearance
As for an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted, you may offer it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it will not be accepted'
Those who are too much and those who are too little in their experience of Christ are alike in that they fail to bear fruit
And anything with its testicles bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, you shall not offer to Jehovah; you shall not do this in your land'
Our experience of Christ needs to come to the eighth day; that is, it needs to be on the level of resurrection
If we are too immature in the divine life, we shall not be able to offer anything to God that would be acceptable to Him as food
And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted
The next item is the festivals, which are for rest and enjoyment, both of which are types of Christ as our rest and enjoyment
The principal denotation of all the annual seasons is for God's people to enjoy rest with God and with one another
It was not something light or common but something quite holy, sacred, and important for God's enjoyment and His people's enjoyment
A holy convocation signifies a corporate enjoyment of rest, not by individual believers separately but by the church corporately
In all the convocations, in all the festivals, we are doing one thing-resting before God and with God and one another
According to their dispensational fulfillment, the first four have taken place already, and the last three will take place in the future
These are the appointed seasons of Jehovah, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed times
The feast of the Passover signifies Christ as our redemption to begin our enjoyment of God's salvation with God
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Jehovah; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread
The feast of unleavened bread signifies the Christ who is without sin for our enjoyment as a feast in a life apart from sin
In that the feast of unleavened bread lasts for seven days, it typifies, or signifies, the entire course of our Christian life
We have been redeemed from sin, and now the Redeemer, who is without sin, is our feast for our entire Christian life
In their teaching, the Brethren did not have much to say about Christ being our life apart from sin for our entire Christian life
In this feast we enjoy one bread-the unleavened bread-which signifies the Christ who is unleavened, the Christ who is apart from sin
Corporately as God's New Testament people, we passed through the Passover on the day the Lord Jesus established His table
The Lord Jesus, the very Lamb of the Passover, after being examined for some days, was put to death on the Passover
He 'took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body'
He gave them the cup saying Drink of it all of you for this is My blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins
In the feast of unleavened bread, the main thing we enjoy is Christ as the unleavened bread, as our life supply without sin
On the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the people were to have a holy convocation and not do any laborious work
And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah that you may be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it'
On the day that you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to Jehovah'
Its meal offering shall be twotenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil as an offering by fire to Jehovah for a satisfying fragrance
As the meal offering, Christ supplies us, supports us, and strengthens us to live such an absolute life for God
The resurrected Christ has become a burnt offering that includes all His believers, who may now live a life that is absolutely for God
Meanwhile, since God is One who enjoys drinking, we should also be a drink offering poured out for God's drinking
The feast of the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, and the feast of firstfruits all took place within about three days
Christ was crucified on the Passover, and, within three days, He was resurrected on the day of the feast of firstfruits
Through His death and resurrection we now enjoy the feast of Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, and the feast of firstfruits
These four feasts are constituted of Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, and Christ's being poured out as the economical Spirit of God
After we experienced the feast of the Passover, we began to enjoy Christ as our unleavened bread and to live an unleavened life
The fourth feast, the feast of Pentecost, or the feast of weeks, took place seven weeks after Christ's resurrection
Counting seven weeks from this day, we reach the fiftieth day, which was also a first day of the week and an eighth day
Christ rose up on the first day of the week, and the day of Pentecost took place also on the first day of the week
The Lord's appearing to the disciples simply means that He made His presence visible to them; it does not mean that He ever left them
During those forty days after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was training His disciples to realize and enjoy His invisible presence
Such a One-the totality of the Triune God-was poured out upon the one hundred twenty disciples, who represented the Body of Christ
Prior to that time, in God's economy there was only the individual Christ to fulfill the desire of God's heart
Every local church is a small part of the universal extension of Christ, which came into being on the day of Pentecost
In a spiritual form, as the consummation of the processed Triune God, Christ is also the fulfillment and reality of Pentecost
We have participated in the Passover, in the unleavened bread, and in the firstfruit, and we have become a part of Pentecost
We may not have much realization of this today, but we shall have the full realization of it in the New Jerusalem
These two loaves signify the two parts of the church as the Body of Christ, the Jewish part and the Gentile part
Why were the loaves in 23:17 to be baked with leaven when according to Leviticus 2 there was to be no leaven in the meal offering?
The reason is that in each part of the church as the Body, as typified by these two loaves, there still is sin
These loaves are the increase, the expansion, of the fine flour that came out of the firstfruit on the day of resurrection
They poured out their soul to God for His satisfaction, even as Christ poured out His soul on the cross to God
You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings
The sin offering is for sin, the peace offering is for fellowship, and the wave offering signifies resurrection
On that same day you shall make a proclamation; you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work
Now we may enjoy the Pentecost Triune God, the Pentecost Christ, and the Pentecost all-inclusive Spirit as our portion
We, the Gentiles, are able to participate in the grace of Christ at the feast of Pentecost as that which was accomplished on the church
In His ascension He poured out Himself as the consummation of the processed Triune God in the form of the economical Spirit
By the time we come to the feast of Pentecost all the negative things have been cleared away and all the positive things have been released
We are enjoying the feast of Passover, and we are still in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first-fruits
We see that the feast of the blowing of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month, the beginning of the second half of the year
Between the fourth feast, Pentecost, and the fifth feast, the blowing of trumpets, there appears to be nothing
We may liken the distance between these two peaks to the time span between the feast of Pentecost and the feast of the blowing of trumpets
During the twenty-seven hundred years since the carrying away to Babylon, the Jews have been a people without rest
Only a part of the homeland has been recovered, and the Jews today are still struggling, for they are a people without rest
When the trumpet sounds, God will call His scattered people, who have so long been without rest, back to the land of their fathers
At the Lord's coming back, God's calling them together from their dispersion back to their fathers' land will be a real memorial to them
The sixth feast is the feast of propitiation, the day of propitiation closely following Israel's repentance unto God
After the Lord Jesus has descended from the air to the earth the Jews will repent mourn and return to God receiving Christ as their Savior
Speak to the sons of Israel and say, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days to Jehovah'
These seven days signify that the festival of tabernacles is not for one day only but for a complete course of days
Then on the fifteenth day of the seventh month when you have gathered the produce of the land you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days
The first is the dispensation of the fathers, also called the dispensation before law or without law, from Adam to Moses
Christ is not only full of fruit but also full of leaves, which in a particular way show the beauty of His humanity
Even today, as we are living in the church life, our relatives may be able to see something upon us that is green, beautiful, and overcoming
In the millennium all the overcomers will live out the evergreen, nourishing, beautiful, and rich scenery of the humanity of Christ
Eventually, the present, portable tabernacles will become a solid one-the New Jerusalem with a foundation of twelve layers
The feast of Pentecost was fulfilled fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit
The feast of propitiation will be fulfilled on the day of Israel's return to God, after they have been gathered back to their fathers' land
Israel's return to God will be not only a physical return to the land of their fathers but also a spiritual return to God Himself
Chapter twenty-five is the continuation of chapter twenty-three, but chapter twenty-four is inserted between them
We are, of course, referring not to the natural and human light and food but to the divine light and the divine food
If there had been no light in the tabernacle, it would have been difficult for anyone to enter it and to act, move, and serve God there
We need the divine food as our supply so that we may be able to act properly move behave and serve God with sufficient supply and strength
We need to have the proper supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in our spirit so that we may have the adequate daily life supply
That shining is the very Christ whom we experienced and enjoyed in the morning tending Himself within us as the shining light
You shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be a memorial portion for the bread as an offering by fire to Jehovah'
Sabbath by sabbath he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it shall be a perpetual covenant on the part of the sons of Israel'
The story of the blaspheming of the holy Name is recorded after the record concerning the arranging of the showbread table
In Leviticus 24:10 and 11 we are told that 'the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian blasphemed the Name and cursed'
We must live a life that always sanctifies our God, a life that always regards our God as the unique One, separate from all other names
We need to take care of the human life and the animal life, the life for the expression of God and the life for the worship of God
In order for there to be a jubilee, it was necessary for God's people to have the practice of observing the sabbath year
We need to enjoy Him not only as our sabbath day but also as our sabbath year, that is, not only as our rest in part but as our rest in full
We all need to learn how to labor with God and also how to cease our work and rest with God as long as He desires to rest
When you sow in the eighth year, you will eat of the old crop until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you will eat the old'
There could not be any landlords, for in God's wisdom the divine regulation, the divine ordinance, was a balance of the natural resources
As descendants of Adam, we all had sold the rights allotted to us by God and even sold ourselves to sin and Satan
The first and last years of this fifty-year period were eighth years, and in between there were six eighth years
The jubilee is a matter of sabbath upon sabbath, an eightfold sabbath signifying resurrection upon resurrection
The first of these words bears the denotation of a time of shouting; the second bears the denotation of trumpeting
At the Lord's second coming, the coming millennium will be a jubilee to them, and they will return to their lost possession
The first group of feastsPassover unleavened bread firstfruit and Pentecostconsummates in the feast of Pentecost to have the Body of Christ
With the second group of feasts-the blowing of trumpets, propitiation, and tabernacles-the highlight is the millennium
In buying or selling the land, the price was to be calculated according to the number of years after the jubilee
According to the greater number of years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewness of years you shall reduce its price'
We had lost our divine possession, but in the New Testament jubilee our possession has been returned to us for our enjoyment
The land shall not be sold into permanent ownership, for the land is Mine; for you are aliens and sojourners with Me'
Although we might become weak and backslided and thus lose our enjoyment of the divine possession, we can still regain it
When the Lord Jesus comes back, they will recognize Him as their relative, and then they will be redeemed by Him
If the lost enjoyment of the church life is not restored in the church age, it will still be lost in the millennium
The loss of the enjoyment of the church life is more serious than the loss of the enjoyment of Christ as our divine possession
We may think that the jubilee is able to accomplish the restoration of everything, but this is not the case, for there is a time limit
If we do sell the church, we have only a limited time to recover it, and not even the jubilee can help us in this matter
The enjoyment of the church life can be restored only within a short time of God's grace, as indicated by the one year
If you lose the church life and do not redeem it in a quick way, you will also lose the church life in the millennium
If you do not have the church life in this age, then the church life will be taken away from you in the coming age
It takes a much longer time to recover the lost church life, for there is a hardship that frustrates us from coming back to the church life
Although there is in the New Testament such a teaching concerning the loss of the church life, not many Christian teachers have seen it
Having this view of the loss and recovery of the church life will help us to realize our need to live a proper church life today
They are not living the church life, for they are simply a small group of believers who cannot be considered a church
As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites shall have a permanent right of redemption for the houses in the cities of their possession
If we are those who serve God adequately in the church life and we lose the church life, it will be easy for it to be restored to us
It will not be easy for us to lose the church life, but if we do lose it, it can be restored easily and quickly
But the fields of the pasture lands of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their permanent possession'
For both the enjoyment of Christ and the enjoyment of the church life, we need to engage ourselves more and more in the church service
If we lose such a church life, we need to redeem it within the time limit prescribed by the statute of limitations
Due to their unclean life, they have lost the church life in this age and the inheritance of the kingdom in the coming age
We cannot lose the church life eternally, but we can lose it temporarily and dispensationally for a thousand years
Rather, we need to be careful and be warned that concerning the recovery of the lost church life there is a time limitation
If we lose the church life, we should try to recover it right away, for we do not know how long the church age will last
To God one day may be as a thousand years, but to us a thousand years is a thousand years either for discipline or for reward
The enjoyment of the land typifies the enjoyment of Christ, and the enjoyment of the house typifies the enjoyment of the church life
The enjoyment of the land does not assure the enjoyment of the house, but the enjoyment of the house does assure the enjoyment of the land
We may take advantage of a brother not only in one way and in one aspect but in a number of ways and in a number of aspects
We may have such a feeling in our heart, and our attitude and spirit may express the feeling that the one indebted to us is our slave
In 2 Corinthians 4:5 Paul says, 'We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
Then he shall go out from you, he and his sons with him, and go back to his own family, and return to the possession of his fathers'
We see that neither the one who planted nor the one who watered could do anything to give life to those whom they served
When God gives growth, there is a revival, a revival that brings in all the grace needed for the spiritual life
In helping a weaker one, your attitude unconsciously may be that such a one is your servant or that he is beneath you
Not ruling over a sold brother with harshness signifies that we should not harshly treat a brother who is in debt to us spiritually
The unbelievers, however, cannot be considered our brothers and sisters, because they do not have the divine life, as we do
Because we and our brothers and sisters have the same life, the divine life, we are in reality of the same one divine family
If you become aware of this indebtedness and you realize that the sister needs help, it would not be right to avoid touching the situation
The selling price and the amount of the refund for redemption was to be calculated according to the number of years relative to the jubilee
We may sell our property and even ourselves, yet have the intention of redeeming what we have sold, either our property or ourselves
And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him'
The one who did not have any means to redeem himself was in a helpless situation until the year of jubilee, the time when he was released
The book of Hebrews deals with the enjoyment of the church life, and most of what is written in this book is the word of righteousness
If we keep this statute, we shall have the enjoyment of the church life in this age and also in the coming age
We need to take care of the saints in a good way, and this care involves our motive, our spirit, our attitude, and our words
Jubilee is not just a matter of shouting, release, recovery, and restoration, for in the last section of Leviticus 25 there are three tests
According to our understanding, we may think that the book of Leviticus should end with the jubilee in chapter twenty-five
In chapter twenty-six we have the word of warning, and in chapter twenty-seven, the devotions concerning a vow
The way of speaking, the contents, and everything related to this word are not simply human but are the divine oracle
In this word of warning there is a kind of prophecy pointing out that the God who had chosen Israel has never given them up
The word of warning in Leviticus 26 is full of instruction; it is full of things that we need to study and learn
We need to learn to receive, regard, respect, and enjoy what God has done and not try to do something for ourselves
Rains in their season signify that the Spirit, typified by rain, is given to the church or to the individual believers in due time
Verses 4b and 5 tell us that if the people obey, 'the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit
Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand; and your enemies will fall before you by the sword'
The lack of increase or multiplication in the church is a strong sign that before God the church is wrong in some way
He has passed through incarnation, through human living, through an all-inclusive death, and through a wonderful resurrection
Many believers ignore what God's work has accomplished for them and work by themselves to accomplish something for themselves
We may ignore God's work and seek to do something for ourselves and by ourselves under the cloak of doing something for God
These three matters-God, God's work, and the result of God's work-are covered fully in the sixty-six books of the Bible
After He became incarnate, He lived on earth as the God-man, as God in a man, for thirty-three and a half years
For thirty-three and a half years the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a wonderful man who was the expression of God
As such a God with humanity, He is 'condensed' as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling, life-giving, consummated Spirit
Seeing the vision of the processed Triune God with His work and the result of His work will constitute us into obedient ones
In a certain church there was a long period of time when there was no distribution of the spiritual food supply
All the days that it lies desolate it will keep a sabbath, a sabbath which it did not keep in your sabbaths, when you lived upon it'
They will stumble over one another as if before the sword, though no one pursues, and you will not be able to stand before your enemies
Now we come to a matter that is quite encouraging-the repentance of the people in captivity and the remembrance of God
No matter what the situation may be, we are still under God's New Testament covenant, and we still have our portion
In the New Testament, the grace of God is covered by the ministry of Paul, and God's administration is covered by the ministry of Peter
In the 1920s we studied books on prophecy and came to know the promises concerning Israel in Leviticus and Deuteronomy
During World War I, the British had a shortage of a certain chemical which was crucial for manufacturing ammunition
In 1948 the British forces went ahead of the Jews to drive the Palestinians from their homes, and the Jews moved in
In 1948 the Jews did not take possession of the old section of Jerusalem, which was still controlled by Jordan
In 1967, during what is called the Six Day War, Israel took over the remainder of Jerusalem and the West Bank of the Jordan River
The offerings refer to Christ, and the priesthood indicates the body of priestly service that takes care of the offerings
After seeing our condition, we were brought into the enjoyment of the feasts, and this leads us into the jubilee
When we add together the offerings, the priesthood, our condition, our enjoyment of Christ, and the jubilee, the sum, the total, is a vow
Leviticus, a book of the priesthood, ends with our devotion of ourselves and of our possessions, our cattle, land, and houses
In chapter twenty-seven we have not four kinds of consecrations for a vow but four kinds of devotions for a vow
The ones in this category, the most valuable, signify those who are spiritually strong, mature, experienced, and able to war in the church
We see that the valuation of a female from twenty to sixty years old is thirty shekels, second to that of the males above
If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels'
And if the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver'
Those in this category are the least valuable of the males and signify those who are spiritually the young children
We would note that in God's redemption there is no difference of degree, but in our devotion there is the difference of degree
If it is cattle such as they may offer as an offering to Jehovah, all such that a man gives to Jehovah shall be holy'
Some saints have had a change of mind after devoting themselves to God, and as a result they became indebted to God
And if he who sanctified it would redeem his house, then he shall add to it one-fifth of the valuation in money, and it shall be his'
Nowhere in the New Testament can we find so many details concerning our consecration, or concerning what is called in Leviticus devotion
We must take care of our devotion in these details regarding ourselves, our possessions, and our house and land
The value of this piece of land would be higher than a piece of land devoted only twenty years before the jubilee
We may consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but our consecration may not afford very much prospect of the increase of the church
When Paul devoted himself for the enjoyment of Christ, that devotion had a great prospect of the increase of the church
In these verses we have two ways of valuation: according to the seed required and according to the number of years from the jubilee
As we devote ourselves, our time, and our energy to preaching the gospel, we shall be helped to enjoy the Lord more
The amount, the degree, the level, of the enjoyment of Christ is figured by the seed required and by the number of years to the jubilee
And if he who sanctified the field would indeed redeem it then he shall add to it onefifth of the valuation in money and it shall remain his
If we devote and we want to reclaim what is devoted, we have to pay the price and then add one-fifth of that price
The important matter here is not the amount added to the price-it is getting ourselves involved with the enjoyment of Christ
But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore'
And when the field is released in the jubilee, it shall be holy to Jehovah, as a devoted field; his possession shall belong to the priest
In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought, to whom the possession of the land belongs'
According to the statute of the jubilee, the land was to be returned to the original owner, who was the devoter and also the seller
But the firstborn among the beasts which as a firstborn belongs to Jehovah no one may sanctify whether it is an ox or a sheep it is Jehovahs
And every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah
Every tithe of the herd or of the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to Jehovah
He likes to see that we devote to Him our time, ability, possessions, strength, whatever we have, and whatever we can do
Leviticus, a book on what God has done for our enjoyment, ends with God's aspiration that we devote ourselves to Him
Prophecies are implied in the types of the feasts, in the type of the harvest and the gleanings, and in the type of the jubilee
The harvest left at the corners of the field and the gleanings for the alien and for the poor denote God's salvation left for the Gentiles
The warning indicates that in obeying God Israel will be blessed, but in disobeying God Israel will be chastised
According to these chapters, our contact with others may be unclean, and our source, our origin, is uncleanness
We have not only been redeemed back to God and brought into His presence- we have been brought into God Himself
Our enjoyment of the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God brings us to the fourth point-the jubilee
The jubilee is the completion and the consummation of our enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God in God Himself
We all need to respect God's completed work, the work that God has accomplished for our interest and for our rest
When we agree with God and go along with Him, we spontaneously obey Him, and by obeying Him we receive His rich blessing
If we would be those who enjoy God, God's work, and the result of God's work, we need to respond to God's desire by making a vow
We need to make a vow in which we tell God that we shall enjoy Him according to what is revealed in the book of Leviticus
We should tell Him that we want to enjoy Him by regarding Him, by respecting His work, and by honoring the result of His work
We all need to regard God, His work, and the result of His work, go along with Him, and become those who enjoy Him
