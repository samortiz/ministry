   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS Practicing Having All Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Common Peking</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The First Step: Going Bankrupt Again</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After I returned to Peking, I fasted and prayed for one day with Brother Fang, Brother Xing, and Brother Sun. We wept loudly and felt very ashamed that we had not attained to the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before the Lord, we carefully considered having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all felt that we would not be able to get through inwardly if we did not practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, a few of us brothers began to practice having all things in common.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before we began this practice, our first step was to go bankrupt again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We pulled everything out and piled it together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this time onward, nothing was our own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On their lists the brothers did not just write down their clothes; they also wrote down the words "willing to be poor."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The brothers all felt very joyful and released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the end of 1950, the entire church had a time of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Almost ninety percent of the entire group attended, and there were eleven hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be a baptism meeting soon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were so many people sitting in the meeting hall on Kuan Street that no one could pass through, and the yard was also filled with people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord grants us to double or triple our number again in 1951, we do not know where we will meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These days we are expending all our energy to find a larger meeting place, but we have still not been successful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are really worried about the numbers increasing and not having a place to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are now eight separate halls for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All are full of people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The houses are too small and do not have enough seats.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If more people come, we will not be able to contain them in the present halls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the Lord's mercy, we are quickly preparing to add up to seven more halls to resolve our present problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two weeks ago the brothers from Shijiazhuang, Changjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, Taigu, Suiyuan, Baotou, and Shanba came to stay in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's presence was really in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We particularly mentioned the matter of migrating for the gospel, and everyone felt the same sense of urgency.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are making arrangements for such important matters, so we sent one brother to Changjiakou with the brothers who came from there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This brother returned to Peking a day ago and made a detailed report of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Chao Xu-dong said that Shanba could send a score or more in migration to Ningsia.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peking is also preparing to send some out to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is 720 miles from Shanba to Baotou on the east.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is 620 miles from Shanba to Ningsia, but the tickets from Shanba to Ningsia are more expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The capital of Ningsia is Yinchuan City with a population of over a hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past we have emphasized the importance of the brothers and sisters having skills, so some of the brothers and sisters have been learning them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since my return to Peking, we have started to encourage every brother and sister to learn a skill whether or not they stay in Peking or migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have recently sent Brother Fang to visit the brothers in Fengtai.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Xing and Brother Chiao went to Lungchuanwu.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Sun went to Changxingdien.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Chao Xu-dang went to Shijiazhuang.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the future, Brother Sun will go to Baoding with Brother Chao.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it pleases the Lord, this year we will start churches in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Chengde of Reho province, and Tungxian, east of Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our desire and prayer is that 1951 would be our year of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord gain brothers with a heart to seek Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are heavily burdened for this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we want to do our best to gain all those with a heart for this way who live in the provinces of this region.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We often seek fellowship with these people in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank the Lord that Brother Wang Jian-xiao of Shansi who has believed in the Lord for thirteen years and has been imprisoned eighteen times and Brother Yi have come to Peking to have formal fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, they stayed with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are more than five hundred brothers and sisters in the two areas from which they came.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not fall behind by even one step.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Caleb Yen</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>January 12, 1951</S>
