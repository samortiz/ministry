<h1 class="title">God&rsquo;s Economy in Faith versus Differing Teachings</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-4, 18; 6:3, 12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen and redeemed people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;1:4; 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy, as His household administration, is to produce and constitute a Body for His Son&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 2:16; 3:6; 4:4, 16; 5:30.</li>
	<li>The central subject of the Bible is the economy of God, and the entire Bible is concerned with the economy of God&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The governing and controlling vision in the Bible is the divine economy&mdash;Prov. 29:18a.</li>
		<li>In our reading of the Bible, we need to focus our attention on the divine economy for the divine dispensing&mdash;Eph. 3:9.</li>
		<li>Unless we know God&rsquo;s economy, we will not understand the Bible&mdash;Luke 24:45.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of God&rsquo;s eternal economy; He is everything in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Luke 24:44.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into our being that our being may be constituted with His being; this can be accomplished only by God dispensing Himself into us as the divine life&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a; Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
	<li>The economy of God is that God became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us as life and to dispense God into us that we may be transformed for the producing of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ, the ultimate aggregate of which is the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 1:14, 29; 12:24; 20:22; 14:2; 3:3, 5, 29-30; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is God becoming man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5; Rev. 21:10.</li>
	<li>According to the desire of His heart, God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues&mdash;John 1:12-14; 1 John 3:1a, 2; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
	<li>The divine economy is to produce the new creation out of the chaotic old creation&mdash;Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The history of the universe is a history of God&rsquo;s economy and Satan&rsquo;s chaos&mdash;Gen. 1:1-2, 26; Rev. 20:10&mdash;21:4.</li>
		<li>Both in the Bible and in our experience, the satanic chaos always goes along with the divine economy&mdash;Eph. 3:8-10; 4:14-16; 6:24.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs the overcomers, who will be one with Him to conquer the destructive satanic chaos and to triumph in the constructive divine economy&mdash;Rev. 2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 3:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s economy is initiated and developed in the sphere of faith&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>On the negative side, to exercise faith is to stop our work, our doing; on the positive side, to exercise faith is to trust in the Lord&mdash;Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>Faith is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God&rsquo;s requirements but that God has done everything for us and that we receive all God has planned for us, all God has done for us, and all God has given to us&mdash;John 1:16.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is carried out not by our doing in ourselves but by our believing into Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;3:15-16.</li>
	<li>Faith is a matter of seeing a view of the contents of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Heb. 12:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because we have seen a revelation regarding the contents of God&rsquo;s economy, we spontaneously believe in what we see&mdash;Eph. 3:9.</li>
		<li>The ability within us to believe is a product, a result, of having a proper view of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Heb. 11:6, 9, 23-26; 12:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Christian life is a life of faith, a life of believing&mdash;Gal. 3:2, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We do not live according to what we see; we live according to what we believe&mdash;John 20:25-29.</li>
		<li>Our walk is by faith, not by sight&mdash;2 Cor. 5:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s economy in faith is versus differing teachings&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Differing teachings refer to teachings that are not in line with the economy of God&mdash;6:3.</li>
	<li>The differing teachings in 1:3-4, 6-7; 6:3-5, 20-21 and the heresies in 4:1-3 are the seed, the source, of the church&rsquo;s decline, degradation, and deterioration.</li>
	<li>Teaching differently tears down God&rsquo;s building and annuls God&rsquo;s economy; even a small amount of teaching in a different way destroys the recovery.</li>
	<li>For the administration and shepherding of a local church, the first thing needed is to terminate the differing teachings of the dissenting ones, which distract the saints from the central line of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Titus 1:9.</li>
	<li>Paul charged Timothy, his faithful co-worker, to fight against the differing teachings and to fight for God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 2:3-4.</li>
	<li>To war the good warfare is to war against the differing teachings and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy according to the apostle&rsquo;s ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God&mdash;1 Tim. 1:18; 6:12.</li>
	<li>We must avoid differing teachings and concentrate on God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the church&mdash;1:3-4; Eph. 3:9; 5:32.</li>
	<li>The crucial point of the healthy teaching of the apostolic ministry concerns the Triune God processed to dispense Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit into His chosen ones so that they may be brought into an organic union to receive the divine transfusion and thereby become sons of God and members of Christ; as a result, they can become the Body of Christ to express Christ, the One in whom the fullness of God dwells&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 12:12-13, 27.</li>

John 14:2; Eph. 2:19, 21-22; 1 Pet. 2:5; 2 Tim. 2:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As saved ones and members of the church, we need to know the church&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 18:17; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:15, 19-22; 3:4, 10-11; 4:16; 5:32; 6:11.</li>
<li>The desire of the Lord&rsquo;s heart is to gain the church; thus, we should treasure the church and love the church, even as the Lord does and as Paul did&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 13:44-46; Eph. 1:5, 9; 5:25-27; 2 Cor. 12:14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God obtained the church &ldquo;through His own blood,&rdquo; and the church is under the care of the Holy Spirit; this indicates the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness of the church in the eyes of God&mdash;Acts 20:28.</li>
	<li>Because Paul&rsquo;s heart was fully for the church and on the church, he was willing to spend and be utterly spent for the church and to minister life to the church by dying&mdash;2 Cor. 12:14-15; 11:28; 4:10-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church is the church of God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32; 11:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression <em>the church of God</em> indicates that the church is possessed by God and that the church has the nature of God and is constituted with the element of God&mdash;Acts 20:28; Gal. 1:13.</li>
	<li>The church is <em>of</em> God because it is produced of God as its source and has God as its nature and essence, which are divine, universal, and eternal&mdash;1 Cor. 10:32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is the nature and essence of the church; therefore, the church is divine&mdash;Rev. 1:12, 20.</li>
		<li>The content of the church essentially is God Himself&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church of God is the house of the living God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To Christ, the church is the Body; to God, the church is the house&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; John 14:2.</li>
	<li>The house of God is the household of God&mdash;Eph. 2:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The dwelling place&mdash;the house&mdash;and the family&mdash;the household&mdash;are one entity&mdash;a group of called, regenerated ones indwelt by God Himself&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:16.</li>
		<li>The household of God is composed of the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The church is composed of those who have been born of God and have the life and nature of God&mdash;John 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			<li>God dispensed Himself in Christ into us, begetting us as His children; in this way we have become His household&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13.</li>
			<li>The Father is God, and the many sons are God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Just as Christ is not separate from the members of His Body but dwells in them, the Father is not a separate member of His household but is in all His children&mdash;Rom. 8:10; 12:4-5; 2 Cor. 6:16.</li>
		<li>The house of God is organic in the divine life, organic in the divine nature, and organic in the Triune God; because the church is organic, the church grows&mdash;Eph. 2:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul refers to God as the living God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The living God, who lives in the church, must be subjective to the church and not merely objective&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16.</li>
		<li>Because God is living, the church as the house of God is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him; a living God and a living church live, move, and work together.</li>
		<li>The house of the living God is living in the Father&rsquo;s name and in the Father&rsquo;s life, that is, living in the Father&rsquo;s reality&mdash;John 14:6; 17:2-3, 11-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the house of God, the church is the dwelling place of God&mdash;the place where God can have His rest and put His trust&mdash;Eph. 2:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In this dwelling place God lives and moves to accomplish His will and to satisfy the desire of His heart&mdash;1:5, 9, 11; Phil. 2:13.</li>
		<li>In the church as His dwelling place, God expresses Himself; all that He is and all that He is doing are expressed in the church&mdash;1 Cor. 3:16; 14:24-25.</li>
		<li>The dwelling place of God is in our spirit; thus, our spirit is the place of His habitation&mdash;Eph. 2:22; Isa. 57:15; 66:1-2.</li>
		<li>We need to grow in the divine life for the building up of God&rsquo;s house&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6, 16-17; Eph. 2:21; 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the house of God&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s house&mdash;is the enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation as the issue of Christ&rsquo;s being glorified by the Father with the divine glory&mdash;John 12:23; 13:31-32; 14:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is for the processed and consummated Triune God to have a mutual abode with the believers in Christ&mdash;vv. 2-3, 23.</li>
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is for Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, to make His home in our hearts&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a visible and solid household constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation&mdash;2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The house of the living God is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character, whereas the great house (2 Tim. 2:20) refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the great house there are not only precious vessels but also base ones; hence, the great house cannot be the house of the living God&mdash;2 Tim. 2:20.</li>
		<li>The great house is apostate Christendom, but the house of the living God is the genuine church of God&mdash;the household of God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>

The Pillar and Base of the Truth</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15; 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:15, 25; Titus 1:1, 14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As used in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, <em>truth</em> denotes the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 3:15; 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:15, 25; Titus 1:1, 14.</li>
<li>The Lord wants His church to know Him as the truth and to receive and enjoy Him as life&mdash;1 John 1:1-2, 5-6; John 11:25; 14:6; 18:37b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Truth</em> means reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God&rsquo;s Word, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 2:9, 19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The foundation in 2 Timothy 2:19 is the church as the foundation of the truth; this corresponds with the base of the truth, which holds the truth, especially the truth of the resurrection of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Acts 4:33.</li>
		<li>Because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the firm foundation of the truth, it is not hurt by any attack&mdash;2 Tim. 2:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church is built with the divine life in Christ, a life which is indestructible, unconquerable, and able to withstand decline into death from any source&mdash;1 Tim. 1:16; 6:12, 19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the firm foundation of God standing in the eternal life&mdash;2 Tim. 2:19.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is protected by the unconquerable divine life&mdash;Heb. 7:16; Acts 2:24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The recovery is built on something eternal and divine&mdash;God&rsquo;s life with its nature&mdash;John 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			<li>For this reason, not even the gates of Hades can conquer the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Rev. 1:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Both the truth and the life are Christ Himself&mdash;John 14:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Life is the inward and intrinsic content, and truth is the outward definition and explanation&mdash;1:4; 18:37b; 8:12, 32, 36; 17:17.</li>
		<li>The experience of the Lord as life is contained in the Lord as the truth:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If we are not clear about the truth and do not understand and know the truth, we will have no way to enjoy Christ as our life&mdash;Col. 1:5-6; 3:4.</li>
			<li>In order to experience the Lord as life, we must know the truth&mdash;John 14:6; 11:25; 8:32, 36.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The content of the church must be the growth of Christ in us as truth and life&mdash;Col. 2:19; 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Truth is the shining, the expression, of the divine light&mdash;John 8:12, 32, 36.</li>
		<li>The standard of the truth should constantly be raised higher among all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15.</li>
		<li>We need to grow in life, be saved in life, be filled with life, and reign in life&mdash;Eph. 4:13-16; Rom. 5:10, 17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By life and truth Paul encouraged Timothy and inoculated him against the decline of the church&mdash;2 Tim. 1:1, 10; 2:15, 25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Though the churches may become degraded and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, the eternal life remains forever the same&mdash;1:1, 10.</li>
		<li>The word of the truth, rightly unfolded, enlightens the darkened people, inoculates against the poison, swallows up the death, and brings the distracted back to the proper track&mdash;2:15, 25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church is the supporting pillar and the holding base of the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The truth is the Triune God, having Christ as the embodiment, center, and expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God&mdash;Col. 2:9; Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; 1 Tim. 3:15; John 3:3, 5.</li>
	<li><em>Truth</em> in 1 Timothy 3:15 refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Matt. 16:16, 18; Eph. 5:32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of these realities.</li>
		<li>A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church bears Christ as the reality; the church testifies to the whole universe that Christ, and Christ alone, is the reality&mdash;John 1:14, 17; 14:6.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ&mdash;Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19.</li>
		<li>As the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar, the church testifies the reality, the truth, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the church life, we all need to come to the full knowledge of the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization, of the real things revealed in God&rsquo;s Word&mdash;1 John 2:21.</li>
	<li>The full knowledge of the truth is a thorough apprehension of the truth, a full acknowledgment and appreciation of the reality of all the spiritual and divine things that we have received through faith&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim. 2:25.</li>
	<li>The present truth is the truth that is present with the believers, which they have already received and now possess&mdash;2 Pet. 1:12.</li>
	<li>To cut straight the word of the truth is to unfold without bias or distortion the reality of God&rsquo;s economy revealed in the New Testament&mdash;2 Tim. 2:15.</li>
	<li>For God&rsquo;s purpose, we must stand firm for the full knowledge of the truth and fight the good fight against the powers of darkness&mdash;1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7.</li>
	<li>The kind of church we build up depends on the kind of truth we teach; thus, there is the desperate need of the living truth to produce the church, to help the church to exist, and to build up the church&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15.</li>

John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9; Rev. 21:2, 10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, is to have many sons for the expression of His Son so that He may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit and in the Body, which consummates in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; 3:19b, 21; Rom. 8:29.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s manifestation was first in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16; Col. 2:9; John 1:1, 14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it reveals that God was manifested in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</li>
		<li>The entire God and not only God the Son was incarnated; hence, Christ in His incarnation was the entire God manifested in the flesh:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In His ministry in the stage of incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man; in Christ the infinite God and the finite man became one&mdash;John 8:58; 7:6; 12:24.</li>
			<li>Through incarnation the divine incorporation&mdash;God in His Divine Trinity coinhering mutually and working together as one&mdash;was brought into humanity; Christ is therefore the incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man&mdash;14:10-11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Word, who is God, became flesh&mdash;1:1, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The God who the Word is, is not a partial God but the entire God&mdash;God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit.</li>
		<li>The Word is God&rsquo;s definition, explanation, and expression; hence, the Word who became flesh&mdash;God manifested in the flesh&mdash;is God&rsquo;s definition, explanation, and expression in the flesh&mdash;v. 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&mdash;Col. 2:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>All the fullness of the Godhead</em> refers to the entire Godhead, to the complete God.</li>
		<li>Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</li>
		<li>That all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that the Triune God is embodied in Him&mdash;John 14:10.</li>
		<li>As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God but also the entire God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>First Timothy 3:15-16 indicates that not only Christ Himself as the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh but also that the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God is the manifestation of God in the flesh&mdash;the mystery of godliness:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Godliness</em> in verse 16 refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, that is, to God as life lived out in the church to be expressed:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Both Christ and the church are the mystery of godliness, expressing God in the flesh.</li>
		<li>The church life is the expression of God; therefore, the mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:24-25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God is manifested in the church&mdash;the house of God and the Body of Christ&mdash;as His enlarged corporate expression in the flesh&mdash;Eph. 2:19; 1:22-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The manifestation of God in the flesh began with Christ when He was on earth&mdash;John 14:9.</li>
		<li>The manifestation of God in the flesh continues with the church, which is the increase, enlargement, and multiplication of the manifestation of God in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When a church is taken care of according to what is written in 1 Timothy 1&mdash;3, the church will function as the house of the living God for His move on earth and as the pillar and base of the truth, bearing the reality of Christ and His Body&mdash;3:15; Eph. 5:32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Such a church becomes the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s manifestation of God in the flesh&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God.</li>
		<li>This is God manifested in the flesh in a wider way according to the New Testament principle of incarnation&mdash;1 Cor. 7:40; Gal. 2:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The principle of incarnation is that God enters into man and mingles Himself with man to make man one with Himself&mdash;John 15:4-5.</li>
			<li>The principle of incarnation means that divinity is brought into humanity and works within humanity&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; 7:40; 1 Tim. 4:1.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The great mystery of godliness is that God has become man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce a corporate God-man for the manifestation of God in the flesh&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; Eph. 4:24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ultimately, God will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in the new heaven and new earth&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2, 10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the house of God, but the New Jerusalem will be the city of God, signifying that the New Jerusalem, as the manifestation of God in the new creation, will be the enlargement and consummation of the church to express God in eternity&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
	<li>An outstanding feature of the New Jerusalem is that it has the glory of God; the entire city bears the glory of God, which is God Himself shining out through the city&mdash;vv. 11, 23.</li>
	<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source of the divine riches, the Son as the embodiment of the divine riches, and the Spirit as the realization of the divine riches&mdash;is the triune expression of the New Jerusalem for His glorious and utmost expression in His consummated manifestation for eternity&mdash;vv. 18-21; 22:1-2.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 4:7-8; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 4:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In the &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s original intention, man is the center of the entire universe, and the center of man is his spirit&mdash;Zech. 12:1; Gen. 2:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, contain God, worship God, live God, fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose for God, express God, and be one with God&mdash;Prov. 20:27; John 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>Without God being the Spirit and without us having a spirit to contact God, to be one with God, the whole universe is empty and we are nothing&mdash;Eccl. 1:2; 3:11; Job 32:8; 12:10; 2 Cor. 4:13, 16-18.</li>
	<li>Due to the fall, men have not only overlooked and neglected the human spirit but also have even refused to admit that man has a spirit&mdash;cf. 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12; Jude 19.</li>
	<li>Man as a vessel, through the exercise of his spirit, was to receive God in Christ as the tree of life so that life as a river would flow in and out of his innermost being for his transformation into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s eternal expression&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:7-12, 22; 1 Tim. 4:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The breath of God has become our human spirit, and our spirit is God&rsquo;s lamp to contain God as the oil and to give us light&mdash;Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27.</li>
		<li>Man&rsquo;s spirit became a broken lamp through his fall, but through God&rsquo;s recovery in His salvation, man&rsquo;s spirit is regenerated, rebuilt, and reinforced with the vivifying, sevenfold intensified Spirit&mdash;Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; John 3:6; Rev. 4:5; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>The central government and most prominent part of man&rsquo;s being should be his spirit; a man who is ruled and controlled by his spirit is a spiritual man&mdash;2:14-15; 3:1; 14:32; Eph. 3:16; 1 Pet. 3:4; Dan. 6:3, 10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The building of God into man is typified by both the tabernacle and the breastplate, and the key to God&rsquo;s building is our mingled spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The uniting bars of the boards of the tabernacle, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, signify the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit to become the uniting bond of peace&mdash;Exo. 26:26-30; Rom. 8:16; Eph. 4:3-4.</li>
		<li>In the New Testament the reality of the Urim and the Thummim put into the breastplate is the mingled spirit&mdash;the unveiling Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, indwelling our receiving spirit, our regenerated human spirit&mdash;Exo. 28:30; Rom. 8:4, 14; 1 Cor. 2:9-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The divine Spirit dwelling in our human spirit and the two mingled together as one spirit, the mingled spirit, is the strategic and central point of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;John 3:6; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; 1 Tim. 1:4; 2 Cor. 4:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The great way to fulfill God&rsquo;s economy is for us to live and do everything according to the Spirit by exercising our spirit&mdash;Job 10:13; Eph. 3:9; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:25.</li>
		<li>Whenever we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we touch the Body, because the Body is in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18.</li>
		<li>When we are in our spirit, we overcome the world, we cannot sin, the evil one cannot touch us, and we are guarded from idols&mdash;1 John 5:4, 18-19, 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The subject of 2 Timothy is the inoculation against the decline of the church, and the key to receiving and dispensing this inoculation is the exercise of our spirit&mdash;1:6-7; 1 Tim. 4:7-8; Acts 6:10; 1 Cor. 14:32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Godliness, a living that is the expression of God, is the issue of the divine dispensing for the divine economy, and this dispensing depends on the exercise of our spirit to live Christ in our daily life for the corporate manifestation of God in the church life&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4; 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 2 Tim. 1:6-7.</li>
	<li>The word <em>exercise</em> implies forcing; if we Christians want to be strong and want to grow in the Lord, we must force ourselves to use our spirit until we build up a strong habit of exercising our spirit&mdash;1 Tim. 4:7.</li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit is to fan our spirit into flame&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Fire is in our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit; actually, our spirit is the fire&mdash;cf. Luke 12:49-50; Rom. 12:11.</li>
		<li>We saved ones have the capital to live the Christian life and the church life; this capital is our God-given spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit we must deal with the parts of our heart surrounding our spirit&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;1 Pet. 3:4; Psa. 51:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A spirit of power is a spirit with a subdued and resurrected will, a spirit of love is a spirit with an emotion filled with God as love, and a spirit of sobermindedness is a spirit with a renewed mind&mdash;2 Tim. 1:7.</li>
		<li>To exercise our spirit is to exercise ourselves to have a good conscience without offense toward God and men and to have a pure conscience, which means to have a pure heart of seeking only God and His will&mdash;1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 2 Tim. 1:3; Acts 23:1; 24:16; Matt. 5:8; Psa. 73:25-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit by rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything to enjoy the indwelling Spirit is the secret of doing all things in Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 12:2a; Phil. 4:11-13; Psa. 91:1; 1 Thes. 5:16-18.</li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit is to pray, to approach God in a personal and confiding manner, for the interests of God&mdash;Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God&mdash;as the goal in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-8; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2:1-3, 8; 1 Kings 8:48; Jude 19-21.</li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit is to set our mind on the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:6; Mal. 2:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we set our mind on the spirit, we have the inner sense of life and peace, the sense of strength, satisfaction, rest, release, liveliness, watering, brightness, and comfort.</li>
		<li>When we set our mind on the flesh, we have the inner sense of death, the sense of weakness, emptiness, uneasiness, restlessness, depression, dryness, darkness, and pain.</li>
		<li>Our Christian life is not according to the standard of right and wrong but according to the spirit, and we know the spirit by the inner sense of life and peace&mdash;Rom. 8:6; 2 Cor. 2:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit is to discern our spirit from our soul&mdash;Heb. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should always be on the alert to discern and deny anything that is not of the spirit but of the soul, the self&mdash;Matt. 16:25; cf. Luke 9:25.</li>
		<li>Whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do must be in spirit; everything that God is to us is in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 2:28-29; 1:9; 8:4; 12:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To exercise our spirit is to live the normal church life and overcome the church&rsquo;s degradation by pursuing Christ with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Basic Factor of the Decline&mdash;<br />
Turning Away from Paul&rsquo;s Completing Ministry</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 1:12-18; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is the recovery of the central vision of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry; this is the vision of the age in the ministry of the age&mdash;Col. 1:25; cf. Acts 9:4-5, 15; 22:14-15; 26:16-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the New Testament the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, completed the word of God, the divine revelation, regarding God in us as our contents, Christ as the mystery of God, and the church as the mystery of Christ, thereby giving us a full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 3:9; 2 Cor. 4:7; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4.</li>
	<li>The goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the completion of the word of God, which is the commission of the age&mdash;Acts 26:18-19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to complete the word of God in the sense of fully preaching the word, declaring all the counsel of God, all of God&rsquo;s economy, so that we may present every man full-grown in Christ&mdash;20:26-27; Col. 1:28-29.</li>
		<li>We need to complete the word of God in the sense of experiencing Christ subjectively to enjoy Him in our daily living so that the proper church life may come forth to be the corporate manifestation of God in the flesh, the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; Eph. 3:16-21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The basic factor of the decline and apostasy of the church is the turning away from Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry&mdash;2 Tim. 1:15; cf. 2:17-18; 4:4, 10, 14-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For all those in Asia to turn away from Paul meant that they turned away not from his person but from his ministry centered on the economy of God&mdash;1:15-17; 4:4; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Eph. 3:2, 8-11, 16-21; Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17.</li>
	<li>Among the seven churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul&rsquo;s ministry&mdash;Acts 19:1-20; 20:17-38; Eph. 1:1; 1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>
	<li>About thirty years after Paul said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him, the Lord used John to speak to the churches in Asia in the stage of His intensification&mdash;Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6.</li>
	<li>Because they turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the churches in Asia declined into degradation; the first letter being written to the church in Ephesus proves that they took the lead to forsake Paul&rsquo;s ministry and teaching&mdash;2:1-7; cf. 3:16.</li>
	<li>The church in Ephesus left their first love because they left Paul&rsquo;s ministry&mdash;Eph. 1:4; 3:16-19; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2; 6:24; Rev. 2:4.</li>
	<li>The striking point of the churches&rsquo; degradation was the teaching of Balaam (v. 14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans (v. 15), and the teaching of Jezebel (v. 20); these different teachings crept in because the churches turned away from Paul&rsquo;s teaching, the unique teaching of God&rsquo;s eternal economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Different teachings separate us from the genuine appreciation, love, and enjoyment of the precious person of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as our life and our everything&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
		<li>Teachings that differ from the healthy words of the Lord always issue from people&rsquo;s pride and self-conceit, which blind them&mdash;1 Tim. 6:3-4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>One church in Asia was unique and highly appraised by the Lord&mdash;the church in Philadelphia; the Lord appreciated them because they kept the word, which means they did not turn away from the healthy teaching of God&rsquo;s economy, the teaching according to godliness&mdash;Rev. 3:8; 1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim. 4:3.</li>
	<li>The ministry of the healthy, living words of the Lord always brings forth godliness&mdash;a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13; Matt. 4:4; John 6:57, 63; Rev. 2:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whether or not a particular ministry is part of the New Testament ministry can be proved by applying three governing principles: the principle of the processed Triune God being dispensed into His chosen people; the principle of Christ and the church; and the principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10; cf. 14:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If your teaching can pass this threefold test, your teaching is a part of the New Testament ministry, the ministry of the age&mdash;1:10; cf. 14:8.</li>
	<li>The leadership in the New Testament ministry is the leadership of the controlling, God-given revelation of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Acts 26:19; Prov. 29:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>You should not do a work to attract people to follow you; such a one who makes himself attractive is wrong, and if you are attracted to follow him, you help him to be wrong, destroying yourself and him&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
		<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s work we should beware of the ambition to get a place or a district for our work, captivating people to be our private co-workers; our fallen disposition by birth likes to captivate people&mdash;1 Cor. 11:19; Gal. 5:20.</li>
		<li>We should never follow any person; we should simply follow the Lord according to the heavenly and consummate vision of the age&mdash;Acts 26:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The saints who have been raised up by this ministry have a taste for this ministry; this taste is the controlling factor in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;1 Pet. 2:3.</li>
	<li>Those who have been raised with this taste will reject a taste that is contrary to it; this means that if you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, your speaking will be rejected, and you will suffer loss.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two secrets of discerning the genuine New Testament ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The genuine ministry stirs up our love for the Lord Jesus as our Bridegroom so that we may enjoy Him to the uttermost as our Husband&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
	<li>The genuine ministry strengthens us to follow Christ in the fellowship of His sufferings for the sake of His Body&mdash;vv. 23-33; Col. 1:25; cf. 2 Tim. 2:12, 16-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to be preserved in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must &ldquo;guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us&rdquo;&mdash;1:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to verse 13, the deposit must refer to the deposit of the healthy words of God&rsquo;s economy, including the riches of life in the Lord&rsquo;s words, which He has stored in us; we have to deposit the Lord&rsquo;s healthy words into our being, like we deposit money in a bank&mdash;1 Tim. 6:20; Col. 3:16; Psa. 119:72:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To hold a pattern of the healthy words means to live by the healthy words, being nourished with the words of the full gospel concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the sweet words that contain and convey the riches of Christ&mdash;2 Tim. 1:13; 1 Tim. 4:6.</li>
		<li>If we are persons acting, behaving, and having our life in the Spirit through the exercise of our spirit, all that has been deposited in our being will be guarded through the Spirit who is indwelling us&mdash;2 Tim. 1:12, 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In a darkened and confused situation, we must cleave to the enlightening and ordering word in the New Testament, the healthy teaching of God&rsquo;s economy, which concerns God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself in His Divine Trinity into His chosen people so that they may be constituted into the Body of Christ for the manifestation of the Triune God&mdash;Titus 1:9; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The degradation and apostasy of the church took place at the end of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s ministry&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 9:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the believers in Asia turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry, including Phygelus and Hermogenes&mdash;2 Tim. 1:15.</li>
	<li>Hymenaeus and Philetus said that the resurrection had already taken place&mdash;2:17-18.</li>
	<li>Demas, a co-worker of the apostle Paul, loved the present age and abandoned Paul&mdash;4:10.</li>
	<li>Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to the apostle and greatly opposed the apostles&rsquo; words&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
	<li>At the apostle&rsquo;s first defense no one was with him to support him, but all abandoned him&mdash;v. 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Even during a period of decline, a downward trend when most of God&rsquo;s people are carried away, there is always a remnant who remains faithful&mdash;1 Kings 19:14, 18; Rom. 11:5; Ezra 9:8; Neh. 1:3; Hag. 1:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Onesiphorus was an overcomer who resisted the general trend and stood against the downward current to refresh the Lord&rsquo;s ambassador in spirit, soul, and body, not being ashamed of the apostle&rsquo;s imprisonment on behalf of the Lord&rsquo;s commission&mdash;2 Tim. 1:16-18.</li>
	<li>Timothy was one who was fully perfected and equipped to minister the word of God, not only in caring for a local church but also in confronting the worsening decline of the church; he was like-souled with the apostle Paul to genuinely care for the church with all the saints and remind them of Paul&rsquo;s ways which were in Christ&mdash;3:13-17; Phil. 2:19-22; 1 Cor. 4:17; 1 Tim. 1:16; 4:12.</li>
	<li>Luke was the beloved physician, a faithful companion of Paul until his martyrdom&mdash;Col. 4:14; Philem. 24; 2 Tim. 4:11.</li>
	<li>Titus walked in the same spirit and in the same steps as Paul to care for the churches&mdash;2 Cor. 7:6-7; 12:18; Titus 1:4-5; 3:12; cf. 2 Tim. 4:10.</li>
	<li>Mark was useful to Paul for the ministry&mdash;v. 11; cf. Acts 15:37.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Second Timothy is a book written for inoculators, those who would inoculate others against the decline of the church&mdash;2:1-7, 15:

	<li>The inoculator is a teacher&mdash;v. 2; Eph. 3:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord&rsquo;s healthy words, he should train the faithful ones that they too may have a good deposit from the Lord and be competent to teach others&mdash;1 Tim. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:12-14.</li>
		<li>We must shepherd the saints with the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 4:11; Col. 1:27-29; cf. 1 Tim. 3:2; 4:11-16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We should shepherd people by dispensing the divine life in the humanity of Jesus to cherish them and by teaching them the divine truths in the divinity of Christ to nourish them&mdash;Eph. 5:29.</li>
			<li>Shepherding the flock of God by declaring to them all the counsel of God, the economy of God, protects the church from the destroyers of God&rsquo;s building, mingles them with the Triune God as grace, and binds them together in His oneness&mdash;Acts 20:26-30; Eph. 4:14; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Rom. 16:17; cf. Ezek. 33:1-11; 34:25; Zech. 11:7.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The inoculating teacher, as a good minister of Christ Jesus, is nourished with the words of the faith and exercises his spirit to live Christ in his daily life for the church life&mdash;1 Tim. 4:6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The inoculator is a soldier&mdash;2 Tim. 2:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostle considered their ministry a warfare for Christ, just as the priestly service was considered a military service, a warfare&mdash;Num. 4:23, 30, 35; 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 4:7.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is the sounding of the trumpet for the army to go to war; to war the good warfare is to war against the different teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy according to the apostles&rsquo; ministry&mdash;1 Cor. 14:8; 1 Tim. 1:18; Num. 10:9; Judg. 7:18.</li>
		<li>To fight a good fight for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on this earth, we must clear away all earthly entanglements and lay hold on the eternal life, not trusting in our human life&mdash;1 Tim. 4:7; 6:12; cf. 2 Cor. 5:4.</li>
		<li>We must be vigilant to fight the battle against death, the last enemy of God, by being filled with life to reign in life&mdash;Num. 6:6-7, 9; 2 Cor. 5:4; Rom. 5:17; 8:6, 11.</li>
		<li>Our will must be subdued and resurrected by Christ to be like the tower of David, the armory for spiritual warfare&mdash;S. S. 4:4; cf. 1 Chron. 11:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The inoculator is an athlete&mdash;2 Tim. 2:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must run the Christian race until we finish our course, fully accomplishing our ministry in the unique ministry of God&rsquo;s economy so that we may receive Christ as our prize&mdash;1 Cor. 9:24-25.</li>

		<li>We must live the normal church life by pursuing Christ as righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The inoculator is a farmer&mdash;v. 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s cultivated land, and we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers, working together with Him by an all-fitting life to sow the seed of life into people and water them with the Spirit of life by His healthy words&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6, 9; 2 Cor. 6:1a; Luke 8:11; John 7:38; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The word of God, as a grain of wheat, dispenses God as life into us to nourish us; it is also fire and a hammer to purify us and break down our self, our natural life, our flesh, our lusts, and our concepts&mdash;Jer. 23:28-29.</li>
			<li>God has sent forth His word as rain and snow to water His people in order to sanctify them, transform them, and conform them to His image that the Body may be built up&mdash;Isa. 55:8-11; John 17:17; Eph. 5:26.</li>

	<li>The inoculator is a workman&mdash;2 Tim. 2:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion (as in carpentry).</li>
		<li>There is the need of the word of the truth rightly unfolded to enlighten the darkened people, inoculate against the poison, swallow up the death, and bring the distracted back to the proper track&mdash;cf. Acts 26:18; Psa. 119:130.</li>

<h1 class="title">A Man of God with the Breath of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:14-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s ultimate intention is to gain a corporate God-man for His corporate manifestation; God does not desire a good man but a God-man, a man of God with the breath of God&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; 2 Tim. 3:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. 2:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The breath of life breathed into man&rsquo;s body became the spirit of man, the human spirit&mdash;Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8.</li>
		<li>The breath of life breathed into man&rsquo;s body was not the eternal life of God nor the Spirit of God, but because the human spirit came out of God&rsquo;s breath of life, it is very close to the Spirit of God&mdash;cf. Gen. 2:8-9.</li>
		<li>Thus, there can be a transmission between God the Spirit and man&rsquo;s spirit, and the human spirit is able to contact God and be one with God&mdash;Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Pneuma&rdquo;&mdash;John 20:22, lit.:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Holy Pneuma is the Holy Spirit, or Holy Breath.</li>
		<li>In the Gospel of John there are three wonderful words: the <em>Word,</em> the <em>flesh,</em> and the <em>breath;</em> the Word is God, the flesh is man, and the breath is the Spirit&mdash;1:1, 14; 20:22.</li>
		<li>The Word became flesh to accomplish judicial redemption and then resurrected to become the Holy Breath indwelling us and supplying us for our organic salvation&mdash;1:14, 29; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 5:10; 10:12-13; cf. Lam. 3:55-56.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed&rdquo;&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Scripture, the word of God, is the breathing out of God.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s breathing out; hence, His word is spirit, or breath&mdash;John 6:63.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This all reveals that being a man of God with the breath of God requires the exercise of our spirit, the continual receiving of the Spirit, and the breathing in of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;1 Tim. 4:7; Gal. 3:2; Eph. 6:17-18a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The antidote of the divine inoculation against the decline of the church is the God-breathed Scripture, which is profitable for teaching, conviction, correction, and instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work&mdash;2 Tim. 3:14-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible is God&rsquo;s breath, this breath is the Spirit, and the Spirit gives life&mdash;John 6:63:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our reading of the Bible should be our inhaling of God to receive life, and our teaching of the Bible should be our exhaling of God to impart life&mdash;Acts 6:4.</li>
		<li>We need to read the Bible by means of all prayer and petition in the spirit to inhale God and minister the word as the Spirit to exhale God into others&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18a; Acts 6:10; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On God&rsquo;s side, the Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing; on our side, the Bible is for us to receive the breath of God as our profit in four matters: teaching, conviction, correction, and instruction in righteousness:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Teaching equals revelation; to teach is to roll away the veil so that others may see something of the Triune God and His economy&mdash;Eph. 1:17; 3:9.</li>
		<li>Conviction comes from the revelation that we have seen; whenever we see something of God, we realize our mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, and sins, and the result is that we are convicted and reproved; the more we see God, know God, and love God, the more we abhor ourselves and deny ourselves&mdash;cf. Isa. 6:1-8; Job 42:5-6; Matt. 16:24.</li>
		<li>Correction follows conviction and is a matter of setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, and restoring to an upright state&mdash;cf. 7:13-14; James 5:19-20.</li>
		<li>Instruction in righteousness is to be divinely instructed to enjoy Christ as our lived-out righteousness and to be divinely disciplined in being right with God and with man&mdash;Phil. 3:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The issue of God&rsquo;s breathing out of Himself through the Scripture for teaching, conviction, correction, and instruction in righteousness is that the man of God becomes complete, fully equipped for every good work&mdash;2 Tim. 3:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A man of God is a God-man, one who partakes of God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 1:12-13; 2 Pet. 1:4), thus, being one with God in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expressing Him.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s breathing produces God-men; we need to continually inhale the Triune God by reading the Scripture with prayer to receive revelation, conviction, correction, and instruction in righteousness.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To receive the word of God as the breath of God in order to be constituted with God is also to receive the word of God as the sword of the Spirit in order to slay God&rsquo;s adversary&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan is not only the enemy outside of us but also the adversary inside of us; to deal with this inward adversary, we need to experience the killing power of the word, praying over the constant word of the Bible so that it becomes the instant word of the Spirit&mdash;John 6:63; Eph. 5:26; Rev. 2:7.</li>
	<li>The sword, the Spirit, and the word are one; when the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word (the applied word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation), that word is the Spirit as the sword that kills the adversary&mdash;Heb. 4:12.</li>
	<li>The more we take the word of God by means of all prayer in spirit, the more the negative elements in our being are slain; eventually, the self, the worst foe of all, the enemy of the Body, will be put to death&mdash;cf. Rev. 1:16; 2:16.</li>
	<li>Whenever we are troubled by something negative within us, we should take the word of God by means of all prayer in spirit; when the negative things in us are killed through pray-reading, the Lord is victorious.</li>
	<li>We are preserved in the church life and in the ministry by receiving the word as the Spirit to be the killing sword, which is a spiritual antibiotic to kill the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within us so that we can live a healthy Body life, a healthy church life.</li>
	<li>The overcomers keep the Lord&rsquo;s word by always coming to the Lord to contact Him as the living Word in the written Word so that He can become the applied word as the dispensing Spirit in them&mdash;3:8; John 1:1; 5:39-40; 6:63.</li>
	<li>The overcomers are fully constituted with the Spirit as the word of God to be the bride of Christ and the new man, the corporate man of God with the breath of God as the killing sword for the destruction of the enemies of God and the manifestation of the sons of God&mdash;Rev. 2:7; 22:17a; 19:13-15; 2 Thes. 2:8.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord is with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as our empowering grace to stand against the downward current of the church&rsquo;s decline and carry out God&rsquo;s economy through His indwelling Spirit and equipping word for the building up of the church as the corporate expression of God&mdash;1 Tim. 4:6-7; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2:1; 1:14; 3:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Second Timothy begins with our God-given spirit fanned into flame and ends with the Lord being with our spirit to be our empowering grace as the unsearchably rich capital of our Christian life and church life&mdash;1:6-7; 4:22; Eph. 2:7; 3:8.</li>
	<li>Second Timothy begins with the wonderful Christ as our saving grace, continues with Him as our empowering grace, and ends with Him as our ever-present grace&mdash;1:9-10; 2:1; 4:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45), &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17), &ldquo;the Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:22), and &ldquo;he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord as the Spirit with our spirit, the two spirits mingled together as one spirit, is the key of the spiritual fellowship of the regenerated tripartite believers with the consummated Triune God&mdash;Rom. 8:16; John 4:24; Rom. 1:9.</li>
	<li>The Lord as the Spirit with our spirit, the two spirits working together as one spirit, is the skillfulness, the secret, of all the aspects of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;8:16; John 3:6; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; 2 Cor. 3:17-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grace is the circulating Triune God working, flowing, communicating, transporting, transmitting, and dispensing all that He is into us for our enjoyment; the entire church life depends on grace as the circulation of the Divine Trinity within us&mdash;13:14; 1 Pet. 5:10; cf. Heb. 12:28a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first case in the New Testament of grace is the case of God&rsquo;s incarnation&mdash;John 1:14, 16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Mary was graced by God and found grace with God because He came to visit her, and He entered into her and stayed in her to be the very essence of her conceiving a wonderful person, who would be both God and man, a God-man&mdash;Luke 1:28, 30, 35; Matt. 1:18, 20.</li>
		<li>In this principle, grace is God&rsquo;s visitation to stay in us, to be born in us, to be one with us, and even to become us&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Grace is the wonderful Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God in three aspects: what He is, what He gives, and what He does on our behalf for our enjoyment; He can be everything to us as grace because He has been processed and consummated to be the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit&mdash;Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; Philem. 25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Grace is the wonderful Christ in what He is&mdash;John 1:14, 17; 8:58; Rom. 5:17, 21; 1 Cor. 15:10; cf. Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>Grace is the wonderful Christ given to us, dispensed into us, superabounding with faith and love in Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If we are short of something, this shortage is our opportunity to be supplied with more of Christ as grace to meet our timely need for our growth in Him&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Rom. 5:17; 2 Cor. 12:7-9; 1 Pet. 5:5.</li>
			<li>When we cannot do anything, when we are not able to move, and when we have no strength, that is the time to trust in and enjoy the supply of God as grace&mdash;S. S. 8:5-6; Heb. 11:21; Gen. 47:29, 31.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Grace is the wonderful Christ doing everything in us on our behalf:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Grace is Christ as our burden-bearer&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10, 58; 2 Cor. 12:9; Phil. 4:6-7; Isa. 9:6.</li>
			<li>Those who wait on the eternal God (who stop themselves with their living, doing, and activity and receive God in Christ as their life, person, and replacement) will experience the resurrection power of Christ as grace to support, sustain, strengthen, cover, and protect them&mdash;2 Cor. 12:9; Isa. 40:31; Ezek. 1:8; Psa. 17:8; 57:1; 63:7; 91:4.</li>
			<li>We need to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim. 2:1) to be good stewards of the varied grace of God (1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2; 4:29) as teachers (2 Tim. 2:2), soldiers (vv. 3-4), athletes (v. 5), farmers (v. 6), workmen (v. 15), and vessels unto honor (v. 21).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to realize the following basic things and put them into practice so that we may be daily and continually empowered in the grace of Christ&mdash;v. 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be lovers of God to counteract the grievous days of the church&rsquo;s decline with the outward form of godliness and to bring in a day of glory in the church&rsquo;s victory&mdash;3:1-5; 1 Tim. 3:15-16a.</li>
		<li>We need to fan our God-given spirit into flame&mdash;a spirit of power, love, and sobermindedness&mdash;to stand against the downward current in the declining churches&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-8.</li>
		<li>We need to care for the testimony of our conscience by conducting ourselves in the grace of God&mdash;2 Cor. 1:12; Acts 24:16; 1 Tim. 1:19; 2 Tim. 1:3.</li>
		<li>We need to guard the deposit of the healthy words of God&rsquo;s economy, which the Lord has stored in us, through the Spirit who is indwelling us&mdash;vv. 12-14; 1 Tim. 6:20.</li>
		<li>We need to inhale the God-breathed Scripture by means of all prayer so that we can be men of God with the breath of God who exhale God into others&mdash;2 Tim. 3:14-17.</li>
		<li>We need to continue in and be immersed in the healthy teaching of God&rsquo;s economy for God&rsquo;s pleasure and stand against the degrading tide of those who heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears that seek pleasant speaking for their own pleasure&mdash;1 Tim. 4:6-16; 2 Tim. 4:2-5.</li>
		<li>We need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ as righteousness, faith, love, and peace, calling on His name out of a pure heart in our prayer and praise to Him &ldquo;with those&rdquo; in the practice of the normal church life&mdash;2:22.</li>
		<li>We need to continually exercise our spirit to enjoy the riches of Christ as the sufficient grace so that we may live Him as our godliness for the building up of the church as His testimony, bearing all the divine realities (truths) according to God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;4:22; 2:1; 1 Tim. 4:7; 3:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus must be with each one of us in every aspect of our daily life because we are saints; this grace consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and eternal expression&mdash;Rev. 22:21.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Washing of Regeneration<br />
and the Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Titus 3:5</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In 1 Timothy the church is stressed, in 2 Timothy the Scripture, and in Titus the Holy Spirit:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church is the house of the living God, expressing God in the flesh, and is the pillar and base of the truth, the divine reality of the great mystery&mdash;God manifested in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>
	<li>The Scripture is the breath of God, containing and conveying His divine essence for our nourishing and equipping to make us perfect and complete for His use&mdash;2 Tim. 3:15-17.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit is the divine person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature, that we might be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God&mdash;Titus 3:4-7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Greek word for <em>regeneration</em> here refers to a change from one state to another; being born again is the commencing of this change&mdash;cf. Matt. 19:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation, a process that makes us a new man; it is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</li>
		<li>Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&mdash;the divine essence of the new man&mdash;into our being:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation.</li>
		<li>Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Regeneration is a washing in God&rsquo;s salvation, and this washing is a great renewing of the believers by God&rsquo;s salvation to enable them to get rid of all that is of their natural life and the old creation and become God&rsquo;s new creation&mdash;Titus 3:5; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are in the process of being renewed day by day with the divine element by the renewing of the Holy Spirit through sufferings to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16-18; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is newness, and newness is God; the old creation has nothing of God in it, but the new creation is constituted with God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Ezek. 36:26; Matt. 9:17; Eph. 2:15; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rev. 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to be renewed day by day through the renewing of the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit, we need to walk according to the spirit in newness of life and serve in newness of spirit&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Everything related to our regenerated spirit is new, and everything that comes out of our spirit is new; our regenerated spirit is a source of newness because the Lord, the life of God, and the Holy Spirit are there&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:10, 16.</li>
			<li>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must be in spirit; everything that God is to us is in our spirit&mdash;1:9; 2:28-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Through regeneration, our spirit has become a part of God&rsquo;s new creation, but not our soul; we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind (the leading part of our soul) by allowing our mingled spirit to spread into our mind to make our soul a part of the new creation&mdash;Eph. 4:23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be renewed by having God&rsquo;s ever-new essence dispensed into us to replace our old element:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit of God renews the believers by infusing their inward parts with God&rsquo;s attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading&mdash;Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2a; Eph. 5:26-27.</li>
		<li>The Spirit of God renews the believers by causing them to pass through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, that they may be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 6:4; cf. Prov. 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His people is that He wants His people to gain Him, partake of Him, possess Him, and enjoy Him more and more, rather than all things, until their enjoyment reaches the fullest extent, as the divine revelation ultimately unveils in the New Testament, that His people may ultimately become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Phil. 3:7-14; 2 Cor. 4:16-17; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to tear down every aspect of our natural man and to rebuild us with Himself to make us a new man, a part of God&rsquo;s new creation, to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal economy for God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s appearing to Job implied that He wanted to help Job to know that he was in the wrong realm, the realm of building up himself as a man in the old creation in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity&mdash;Job 1:1; 42:5-6.</li>
		<li>Job glorified himself in these things, but God considered them frustrations to be stripped away so that Job might receive God in His nature, life, element, and essence and be metabolically transformed to be a God-man, a man in the new creation, expressing God and dispensing Him into others&mdash;3:1; 19:9; 2 Cor. 4:16; 3:6.</li>
		<li>Job&rsquo;s hope had been to build up the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of his integrity, but God would not allow such a tree to grow within Job; rather, God had plucked up this tree, this hope; although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him; neither did God consider Job His adversary but His intimate friend&mdash;Job 19:10-11; Ezek. 14:14, 20; James 5:11; Job 10:13; cf. Eph. 3:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>While we are in the midst of suffering, we need to receive the renewing; otherwise, the suffering we pass through means nothing to us; we need to be thoroughly and absolutely renewed day by day through the renewing of the Holy Spirit to be as new as the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>

<li>Faith and love are two inseparable, excellent virtues of the believers in Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14; 2 Tim. 1:13; Gal. 5:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through faith we receive the Lord, and through love we enjoy the Lord whom we have received&mdash;John 1:12; 14:21; 21:15-17:

		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith and love are the reality and expression of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;in whom we believe and whom we worship and receive&mdash;Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are out of the Triune God, who desires to be joined to us to be our everything&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Triune God passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and was ultimately consummated as the life-giving Spirit; this all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our regenerated spirit&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
			<li>When we contact the Triune God through prayer and by looking to Him, by means of our spirit, He infuses Himself into us to become the faith toward Him and the love toward those who belong to Him&mdash;Heb. 12:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Such faith and love are the rich grace given to us in Christ by the Triune God, not only to be the motivating power and expression of our spiritual life but also to become our breastplate, which covers and protects the vital parts of our being&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14; 1 Thes. 5:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith and love are connected and go together&mdash;Gal. 5:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Love comes from faith, and faith operates and works together through love:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Faith is active; it receives the Spirit and thus is full of power&mdash;3:2.</li>
			<li>Faith operates through love to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose to complete the sonship of God for His corporate expression&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;4:5-6; Rom. 8:14; 12:4-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Love with faith enables us to love our Lord in incorruptibility so that we may have an overcoming church life for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Christ for the church&mdash;Eph. 6:23-24; 5:32.</li>
		</ol></li>

	<li>Faith is given to us by God that by it we may receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and thereby enter into the Triune God and be joined to Him as one, having Him as our life, life supply, and everything&mdash;2 Pet. 1:1.</li>
	<li>Faith is to believe and to trust in God and in His word&mdash;John 14:1.</li>
	<li>The way for us to be saved and regenerated is simply to believe in the Lord Jesus&mdash;3:15-16; 1 John 5:10-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By faith in the Lord, we receive the forgiveness of sins and eternal life&mdash;Acts 10:43; John 3:16.</li>
		<li>When we believe in the Lord, we believe <em>into</em> Him&mdash;v. 15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By believing into Him, we enter into Him to be one with Him, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us.</li>
			<li>By believing into Him, we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 2:5-6; Col. 3:1.</li>
			</ol></li>

	</ol></li>
<li>Love is for experiencing, enjoying, and living out the immeasurably rich Triune God&mdash;Mark 12:30:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Love issues out of faith and enables us to live out all the riches of the Triune God in Christ with those who have believed into Christ with us in order that the Triune God may have a glorious corporate expression&mdash;Eph. 3:19-21.</li>
	<li>Love is for the believers to minister and transmit the Triune God to their fellow believers so that all the believers may love one another with divine, transcendent love and live a corporate life in Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5, 10.</li>
	<li>Our love for the Lord must be absolute&mdash;Matt. 10:37; 1 John 2:15; Rev. 12:11:

	<li>To give the Lord the first place in all things is to love Him with the first love, the best love&mdash;Col. 1:18; Rev. 2:4.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;To love God means to set our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)&mdash;absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied with Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 2:9, note 3.</li>
	<li>Whatever one loves, his heart, even his entire being, is set on and occupied and possessed by&mdash;1 Tim. 6:10; 2 Tim. 3:2-4; 4:8, 10a:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;I have fought the good fight&rdquo;&mdash;2 Tim. 4:7a:

	<li>A proper Christian life involves fighting the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness and for the interests of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Eph. 6:10-19.</li>
	<li>Whenever we minister Christ to others, we find ourselves in a battle; hence, we should be soldiers fighting for God&rsquo;s interests&mdash;2 Tim. 2:3-4.</li>
	<li>To fight the good fight of the faith means to fight for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; in particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 6:12; 1:4; Col. 2:9, 19.</li>

		<li>We conquer the chaos by the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace&mdash;1:9; 4:22.</li>

		<li>The crown of righteousness will be awarded not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness, and the One who awards it will be the Lord as the righteous Judge.</li>
		<li>The crown of righteousness, of which Paul was assured, is an incentive to the inoculator to overcome the degradation of the church&mdash;Rev. 2:7.</li>
