   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWELVE THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 6 THE BODY OF CHRIST 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further details regarding the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With Christ as the Head</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 5:23 Paul says, "Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Savior is a matter of love, whereas the Head is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We love Christ as our Savior, but we must also be subject to Him as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Head of the church, the Body, Christ is joined to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as in one's physical body the head and the body are one, so Christ, the Head, and the church, His Body, are joined and therefore are one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body is one with the Head in the divine life and in the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that what the Head has gained now belongs to the Body, for it is transmitted to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body, therefore, comes into existence from the transmission of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever Christ has passed through, obtained, and attained is now being transmitted into the Body. a. In Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the Head of the Body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is indicated by Paul's word in Colossians 1:18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before His resurrection, Christ was not yet the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 1 indicates that after His ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Christ's headship is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because Christ's headship is in resurrection, the experience and enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being. b.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With Preeminence</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the Head of the Body in resurrection and with preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Colossians 1:18 reveals that Christ, the Head of the Body, is the Firstborn from among the dead "that He might have the first place in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In both the old creation and the new creation, Christ is the first and occupies the first place, the place of preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both in the universe and in the church, Christ is the preeminent One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we see this as a vision, not as a mere doctrine, our living and our church life will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We shall realize that in all things Christ must be first, that He is the Head of the Body with preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the first, He is all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's way of reckoning in this matter is different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, from God's point of view, for Christ to be the first means that He is all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, for Christ to be the Firstborn from among the dead means that He is everything in the new creation, the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we shall not be separated from Him by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall remain in Him without any insulation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not receive the supply that comes from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when the Body is supplied by holding the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Body grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head.</S>
