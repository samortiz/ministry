[1]  CONTENTS COLLECTION OF NEWSLETTERS 2 AND WATCHMAN NEE'S TESTIMONY Preface
[2]  Volume 26 of The Collected Works contains the final three issues of Collection of Newsletters which was published from late 1933 until July 1935 in order to facilitate fellowship between the churches and communication among the saints in various localities.
[3]  10 September October 1934 A MESSAGE FROM BROTHER LAN CHIH YI
[4]  I returned to Hankow after the end of the Third Overcomer Conference and was dealt with deeply by God.
[5]  I have not written to you for a long time because I have been too lazy to write since we parted.
[6]  I would like to mention some matters briefly so that we may thank the Lord together!
[7]  I was enlightened by God during the meetings, so that my spirit sprouted new life and I learned something of His truth.
[8]  I was very joyful to be able to fellowship with the brothers in the Lord in the Body.
[9]  Since I left the denominations at the start of the year, two years ago, I believe that I have received God's grace and received His sweetness in my living.
[10]  It comforted and encouraged me very much because I was struggling, wanting the Lord to give me a meeting while at the same time feeling in my deepest part that I should wait for Him.
[11]  The following letter was written to Brother Witness and me by Sister Lee while she was traveling and working in southern China.
[12]  I did not mean to place a heavy burden upon the brother, but I have a desperate reason for not being able to return to Shanghai the sisters outside of Shanghai truly have a need.
[13]  At this time, in the various places, through personal fellowship with the brothers and sisters and from what I have seen and heard, I have much for which to be grateful to the Lord.
[14]  I lay sick in bed for thirty-one years just like the man in John 5 who was sick for thirty-eight years.
[15]  Today I have been completely healed by the Lord Jesus.
[16]  At first I was baptized by sprinkling, but later I went to another denomination and was baptized by immersion.
[17]  It was just like in Revelation 3:1 where the Lord said, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."
[18]  First, please ask the Lord to keep me and strengthen me to the end. Second, please ask the Lord Himself to do a good work in me and glorify Himself through this useless, weak vessel to testify for Himself.
[19]  1 Before there was a meeting here, we listened to the Word and worshipped in the meeting in the Ao Nei denomination.
[20]  At that time I listened to the Word, but I did not know that Jesus was crucified for me or that He died and lives for me.
[21]  Thank God, in 1928 Brothers Wang, Ts'ai, and a few other good servants of the Lord came from Wu Tai and Tai Sun to meet with us in Ts'uo Tze.
[22]  THE TRAVELS OF THE CO-WORKERS IN P'ING YANG
[23]  To our two brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:
[24]  Our Lord is to be praised because while we were walking in error, He called us and led us back so that we would walk according to His way.
[25]  In April I sent a letter to Collection of Newsletters with news of the co-working brothers.
[26]  I do not know much about the Little Flock, but I feel that you are taking the easy way and are not willing to bear the cross in the church to help the weak brothers more with the strength God has given you.
[27]  I thank you very much for your kindness, but there are a few things that I must explain:
[28]  I have a small question that I hope you can answer for me.
[29]  When I was in Shanghai, Brother Liu Tien Min of Shantung also wrote a letter asking about this matter.
[30]  He also preserved His servant, Brother Luan, so that he was very healthy physically...Many brothers and sisters who love the Lord in the denominations came to attend the meetings.
[31]  The edification which the children of God received at the last Overcomers' Conference seems to be more than they received in the two previous conferences.
[32]  When I was in Shanghai, I told you a little about the way I had been going for the past few years.
[33]  However, I can be silent no longer, because I need those who are in one accord with me to pray for me and instruct me.
[34]  I had a little knowledge about the denominations for quite some time, but because there are still a few faithful lovers of the Lord in the denominations, I really could not bear to separate from them actually, it was not being separated from the brothers but from the denominations !
[35]  To the brother in the Lord, Mr. Kuang Hsiung:
[36]  After leaving Shanghai, I have often thought about the grace the Third Overcomer Conference gave us.
[37]  If the Lord is willing, in the near future I will do my best to write something and to fellowship about the gifts from the Lord and how they edify and render help for people concerning their gifts from the Lord.
[38]  Question:If a believer's wife does not believe and the believer allows her to prepare the demonic feast when it is their turn to care for the family worship of demons, or if a believer's father and mother are not believers and he cannot stop them from worshipping demons, does the believer have a part in either of these two sins of idolatry?
[39]  With the exception of a few brothers who are clearly saved, it is difficult to tell whether or not the others are brothers.
[40]  Although Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing often works among them to help and encourage them, he is unable to do anything either! Nevertheless, thank the Lord and praise God! The Lord remembers and cares for His poor little lambs! He does not cast away the church He purchased with His blood.
[41]  Most of the brothers obeyed the Lord, but a few brothers wanted to preserve the denominations.
[42]  Although the brothers in T'o Ti received the enlightenment of the truth at the same time as the brothers in Hsiu Hsi, they were keener than the brothers in Hsiu Hsi in their obedience to the Lord.
[43]  After the meeting in T'o Ti left the denominations, Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih and Brother Lai Chi Ho were led by the Lord to come to this locality to preach the gospel.
[44]  We are writing this letter to you because we want to place a problem we have before all the brothers and sisters so that we can all seek God's will and He may be glorified.
[45]  In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing" 2 Kings 5:17-18 .
[46]  Greetings to the servants of God, my most respected and beloved brothers, Mr. Watchman and Mr. Kuang Hsiung:
[47]  I have not written for a long time, but I think of you often.
[48]  My dear brother, Wang Yu T'ing, was led by the Father God in March to go to the meetings in the Lord in Ya Yang, Tai Shun to do some work a five-day conference .
[49]  Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord
[50]  I read them several times and saw that an unworthy person like me can partake of God's grace only because I have been chosen by the Lord Jesus and sent by God.
[51]  When I first came here, there was no place to meet, and I did not know any who were believers.
[52]  Now he says to me, "When you first testified for the Lord to me, I did not really refuse it, but there were several questions in my heart which had not been resolved, so I did not want to accept it loosely."
[53]  May the brothers and sisters who walk with us in the way of the cross pray much for us so that Satan will not frustrate God's work and so that the glory will completely be to the Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[54]  1 Miss Peace Wang's father, the senior Mr. Wang, was convicted for political crimes and sentenced to jail a short time ago.
[55]  The brothers and sisters cared and prayed for him; his sentence is up and he has returned home.
[56]  On the one hand, we are happy for Miss Wang because God has comforted the heart of His maidservant so that she will be able to work in peace in the future, knowing that God is the responsible One.
[57]  11 February 1935 THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING IN SINGAPORE
[58]  I have twice received your letters; in my earthly loneliness, I have received comfort by the Lord's grace so that I could taste "gaining a hundredfold" in this life.
[59]  By the Lord's love I have received a copy of the book Worshipping God.
[60]  For this reason, whenever I thank the Lord, I often remember Sister Lee, the author.
[61]  At first they thought that I was a member of the Anglican Church although I clearly stated that I left them ; therefore, they hoped that I would go back there, and they often asked me to go there to testify.
[62]  Although your name is misunderstood among the public, may the Father God greatly bless you.
[63]  I am not writing this letter to apologize to you, nor am I trying to comfort you, but I want to testify concerning the Lord who loves sinners with His marvelous salvation, glorious freedom, and inscrutable guidance.
[64]  When my two younger brothers began pursuing and desiring the Lord, they were cheated by the miserable gospel of relying on works, keeping commandments, and hoping they might be saved.
[65]  The Lord sent His servant to me so that I would understand that salvation is by grace, not by works, that it is a present matter, according to Acts 26:17-18, which says, "I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me."
[66]  May the brothers and sisters in the Lord thank God unceasingly whenever they hear of or encounter a situation in which an individual or a church is misunderstood or persecuted, because the Lord is again using His marvelous salvation, glorious release, and inscrutable leading to call His children out of darkness.
[67]  To my dear brothers in the Lord, Shen Ting Ling and Mark Shen:
[68]  First I went from Hangchow to Shanghai where I took a steamer to Foochow.
[69]  I pray that God would direct me as to how to arrange my future so that I would glorify Him in all things.
[70]  When I did not have a place to live in August of last year, He suddenly prepared a place in P'o Nan Shih Yang of P'ing Yang for me to live.
[71]  There is no meeting here in the Lord's name, but there are a few brothers who live with me.
[72]  After the brothers received a little light of the truth, they still went to the denominations, but they felt that it did not help them as much as it once did.
[73]  I was afraid that they did not have the assurance of the truth and were only leaving the denominations to follow their emotions, so I was not really confident about them.
[74]  Greetings in love to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman:
[75]  I really miss you because we are so far apart.
[76]  I often think of writing you, but since my business is very busy, I do not have time to put a pen to paper and communicate with you.
[77]  I can only fellowship with you in my prayer before the Lord.
[78]  I listened to messages for six or seven years, and I was a preacher for one year, but I still did not know whether or not I was saved.
[79]  Greetings to Mr. Nee, Mr. Kuang Hsiung, and Mr. Shou Ling:
[80]  He really blessed us through the truth that was released; many brothers and sisters learned what the Body of Christ is all about.
[81]  I have told many people to trust in the Lord, but I myself did not!
[82]  When Brother Chung Chieh and I arrived in the port of Swatow, we did not do many things, but we first bowed down before the Lord with the brothers and sisters to learn to rely on the Lord.
[83]  I hope you can check them and correct them for me.
[84]  To Brother Watchman who helps me to rely on God
[85]  In the ninth issue of Collection of Newsletters, I read a paragraph you wrote concerning this publication that closely matched what I had felt in my heart for a long time.
[86]  This spring my life was dry and withered, so I had the idea to put away my Bible and was in a dilemma.
[87]  When I was the weakest, I continued to receive Collection of Newsletters and I felt the burden and strength in my heart to write the letter that was published in the ninth issue as "A Letter from Dairen" telling you of my condition and asking for your prayers.
[88]  With regard to the matter of consecration, I feel that everything is the Lord's. Are only giving money and preaching the gospel consecration? In my view, it seems that the greatest consecration in the Bible was when Joseph offered his grave to the Lord, because although the worldly people will give something to the poor, no one is willing to sell his burial plot.
[89]  I really am like a wounded soldier who has fallen near the line of battle in a remote border region.
[90]  From the time I left Shanghai until now, I have not broken bread once, nor have I prayed with brothers in the way.
[91]  May the grace, peace, and strength of the Lord fill you.
[92]  The Lord Christ loves us, died and rose for us, obeyed the Father's will, and delivered us from so great a perdition; He is still saving us and will save us in the future.
[93]  We hope that each reader prays earnestly and much before the Lord for us humble and weak ones, asking the Lord to grace and protect us and to give us the leading of the Holy Spirit as we walk in His way so that we would obey His will and serve Him faithfully until the day of His coming, amen.
[94]  Each believer which the Lord has purchased with the high price of His precious blood has passed through different situations.
[95]  A few believers from this locality have recently scattered to Changchow, Hsien You, and Fu Ch'ing because of their jobs.
[96]  Thank the Lord for opening the way for His children, lest they be taunted as "jobless believers."
[97]  Although it seems that there are more empty seats every time we meet, we believe that the Lord who wants all men to be saved will add more brothers and sisters to us.
[98]  We hope that they will obey the Lord one by one in the near future so that they will remember the Lord and have fellowship together with us.
[99]  THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST OVERCOMER CONFERENCE IN HANGCHOW The Beginning
[100]  During our prayer meeting in the middle of May 1934, the brothers meeting in the Lord's name in Hangchow perceived a hunger among God's children for the truth in our age of desolation, and felt that we should pray that God could have a conference through the Hangchow brothers to serve the brothers and sisters in the various places.
[101]  After much prayer, the Lord's Spirit led us, the brothers and sisters in Hangchow, to be of one mind in acknowledging this to be the Lord's will.
[102]  Under these conditions we did not think that we could do it; even the brothers with experience in the Lord thought that it would be impossible.
[103]  We have to thank God for many points concerning this conference.
[104]  There were brothers and sisters attending this conference from twelve different provinces.
[105]  Although they spoke different dialects, had different ways of living, different personal backgrounds, and different levels of spirituality, most of the people were of one mind in seeking God's eternal purpose, in pleasing God, and in expressing Christ's heart of love in the testimony of oneness.
[106]  The Lord used this to teach us, the brothers and sisters in Hangchow, a lesson so that we would know how to serve His members from now on.
[107]  Thank and praise the Lord that He led me to Hangchow and caused me to obey Him.
[108]  Brother Chiang Shun T'ien exhorted me to go the meetings in Hangchow, and I said at the time that I would go, but I never went.
[109]  However, I was very willing to read books by Brother Nee, and I often told others about them, but I was unwilling to go that way.
[110]  At first I felt that the "Little Flock" was a sect, but now I know that if I call others a little flock, I myself am part of the big flock the world and am not saved!
[111]  Peace to my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Shun T'ien:
[112]  I had already sent a letter on the eighth with Brother Yi Sheng's letter.
[113]  When I read your letter, it filled my heart with happiness because you and Brother Ma are going to come back soon and because Brother Nee is somewhat better and can go out on the street.
[114]  I am very, very sorry because I received your letter from Shanghai a long time ago.
[115]  When I received your postcard that was sent before you left, I thought that I could go by any means to Ch'ang-ch'un to see you before you left.
[116]  I deeply felt that I have offended the Lord much because I did not take care of our brother in love.
[117]  Yesterday, Brother P'ei Jan passed your letter on to me, and I got to know that you have placed me in the Lord's love and remember me continually.
[118]  I really thank the Lord for His grace, and I thank you for your love.
[119]  Before they held their first table meeting, I was led by the Lord to go to Singapore in June and have some deep prayer with Brothers Wang and Chang to seek the Lord's will concerning our future.
[120]  If the Lord is willing, I will probably take Brother Cheng Kai Hao from Jou Pu to visit my brothers and sisters in Sitiawan with me.
[121]  If the Lord does not send someone to bear the responsibility in Southeast Asia, we entreat Him to open the way for one of the brothers among us to go to Shanghai and be trained by the Lord in Brother Nee's place.
[122]  I received your last letter and have already passed it on to the brothers and sisters in Chefoo.
[123]  We have been calling on God for you in our prayers, asking that your body would be strong and that you would have enough strength to serve our Lord Jesus Christ and the brothers and sisters in all the localities.
[124]  Please deeply thank our dear brothers in the Lord for us Brothers Lee Kuan Hsun, Ma Ti Sheng, Chang Yang Teh, Jan Ch'i Yu, Yang Chen Chung, and all the other brothers.
[125]  We really thank the Lord for loving us so much and giving us His Word.
[126]  It is really marvelous that the Lord gave Brother Pi Chen a word from two places, but it was still the same word.
[127]  Many brothers and sisters were coming and going, and they needed rides to and from the station; there were also many other small matters that took up all our time, so we must ask you to forgive us.
[128]  I really thank the Father God that when I was suffering in my heart, He caused you to give me a verse from the Bible that really helped me.
[129]  Greetings to the holy brothers, partakers together of the heavenly calling in the Lord, with the brothers who bear the responsibility as elders and deacons.
[130]  I received good hospitality some time ago in Shanghai and was given many gifts which were really a sweet savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
[131]  I have no words to express my thanks to you for your loving care in the Lord while I stayed in Shanghai this time.
[132]  The first three days will be message meetings, and the last four days will be administrative meetings all the responsible brothers and sisters from all the localities in this region will be there .
[133]  After seeing you this time, I discovered that the brothers and sisters who meet in Shanghai still care for me and the assembly here in the Lord.
[134]  I know that there is a new battle to fight and a new course to run in the future, but by the Lord's victory, I deeply believe that the Father will give me the grace in the Lord to endure to the end.
[135]  It has been three months since we parted, and I really miss you.
[136]  There are also some other matters that I would trouble you about: 1 Please greet Brother Chou Wei Ku, Brother Chi, Brother Yang, and Brother Shen.
[137]  I received your letter on the evening of the eleventh and learned of your charge to me to preach the gospel to Mr. Chin Tao Pen.
[138]  That evening I gave the brothers and sisters the responsibility to pray and ask the Lord concerning His leading.
[139]  He left his house at 6:20 p.m. and did not find the place until 8:00 p.m. A few brothers and I preached the gospel to him.
[140]  Brother Luan and Brother Chen from Hua She came to meet the train when it arrived in Nan Hsin.
[141]  A LETTER FROM P'U MEN MA CHAN, P'ING YANG,
[142]  I am sorry that I have been too lazy to pick up a pen and write a letter of greeting since you left our locality.
[143]  Because I am not very learned, I am afraid to show you my letter.
[144]  Although the brothers in the denominations do not obey or walk the Lord's way with us, we thank the Lord much for one thing: God has blessed our meeting so that every day our number increases.
[145]  I was just thinking of you, when I suddenly received your letter.
[146]  According to my plan, I intended to go to Shanghai to be instructed, but because of different kinds of frustrations, I am unable to fulfill my wish this week.
[147]  Since we parted I have been blessed by the Lord.
[148]  When I went to Tsinan, I met Brother Liu T'ien Min there.
[149]  Our intention when first publishing Collection of News- letters was that through this little publication the brothers in all the localities might be able to share their news with each other and that the assemblies in various places might be able to fellowship with one another.
[150]  We had also hoped to obtain more news concerning the personal spiritual experiences of the brothers and sisters so that all the saints in different localities could be mutually edified in their spiritual life.
[151]  I am really fearful that in every locality there are brothers who, being limited in understanding and spiritual experience before God, only have a little knowledge about outward matters such as baptism, head covering, and denominations, and exhaust their effort to publicize these matters.
[152]  Several years ago seven believers from England and America visited Shanghai and requested fellowship with us at the Lord's table.
[153]  We immediately received them because they were brothers in the Lord.
[154]  We received them in the same manner we usually received brothers from different denominations.
[155]  4 Does this mean then that we should segregate the children of God or decide which believer can have fellowship with us and which cannot?
[156]  Who then could judge which one is an overcomer?
[157]  Can we reject, therefore, the fellowship of those whom we deem unspiritual and unworthy of our fellowship?
[158]  8 Some people may have doubt about our practice of receiving others, a practice which is based only upon whether they are Christians and which leaves the responsibility of attending the bread-breaking meeting to them.
[159]  However, we should realize that the fellowship among Christians is too spiritual a matter, with which no human hand should interfere nor defend.
[160]  11 This may conflict with your concept of what is right or wrong.
[161]  Many of God's children whom you judge to be "wrong" in their conduct could never be accepted by you.
[162]  Because I was suffering from heart disease in February of last year, I do not have much strength even when I am feeling somewhat better.
[163]  For this reason, I have not been able to answer many letters in a timely fashion; some have not been answered at all.
[164]  The following is a new edition of the original book Watchman Nee's Testimony.
[165]  These three testimonies were given by Brother Watchman Nee in a co-workers' meeting held at Kulangsu, an island off the southeastern coast of Fukien province, China, in October 1936.
[166]  As far as I know, this was the only occasion in his life on which he spoke about his personal affairs in detail.
[167]  I have often in the past been thinking of publishing these three testimonies, but in order to share his outlook, I have postponed until now after the lapse of thirty-seven years.
[168]  I hope that the readers will not pay attention to the person himself, but will pay attention to the work of the Lord in him, and to his willingness in allowing the Lord to perform His work.
[169]  As Paul said, "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ" 2 Thes 1:12 .
[170]  He preached the gospel to me, explaining that God loved me and gave His only begotten Son for me, and that if I would truly believe in Him, I would not perish but would have eternal life.
[171]  In 1935 in Chefoo, Brother Nee experienced anew the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[172]  After this, he held a conference in Chuanchow, Fukien, and asked me to attend.
[173]  There many were helped to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, with the result that they had power and boldness to witness for the Lord.
[174]  By that time I had become clear concerning the Lord's call and was prepared to resign my teaching job to live by faith and serve the Lord.
[175]  While I was seeking the Lord for His guidance, I received Brother Nee's invitation.
[176]  I thank the Lord that at this conference I was given the rare opportunity of listening to Watchman Nee's testimony, which I was later able to publish as three articles.
[177]  So she spoke to the Lord, saying, "If I have a boy, I will present him to You."
[178]  If I were to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior, I would simultaneously accept Him as my Lord.
[179]  At that time I was afraid of being saved, for I knew that once I was saved I must serve the Lord.
[180]  Whether I sat or reclined, I could find no rest, for within was this problem of whether or not I should believe in the Lord.
[181]  After being saved, I continued on in school, though I had little interest in books.
[182]  Others read novels in class, but I diligently studied the Bible.
[183]  I even considered that I was quite good and that I had been transformed in many ways, not realizing that there was much yet to be learned and much to be dealt with.
[184]  I admitted that I was not yet good enough, but I felt that with the passing of more time I would improve.
[185]  When my schoolmates saw me, they recognized that I had changed, but I had not changed thoroughly, for I still occasionally lost my temper and did some things wrong.
[186]  Though some had been saved, I was still not satisfied, because many in the school and in the town were still not saved.
[187]  I felt the need to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to receive power from above that I might be able to bring more people to the Lord.
[188]  But when I heard this testimony, I said to the Lord, "I am willing to remove anything standing between God and me in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[189]  I must admit that I did love her, but at the same time I suffered her laughter at the Lord I believed in. I also questioned at that time whether she or the Lord would have first place in my heart.
[190]  In 1923 seven of us worked together as co-workers.
[191]  Today I want to testify concerning four things: 1 learning the lesson of the cross, 2 leading in the work, 3 receiving healing to my sickness and experiencing God as my Healer, and 4 four aspects of work entrusted by the Lord.
[192]  When I was being tempered together in the service with my co-workers, the Lord ordered many crosses for me.
[193]  Inwardly, however, I knew that if the cross were ordered by the Lord, it would be the right thing, though it would still be difficult to obey and accept it.
[194]  At the beginning of 1923, we started to hold meetings in Foochow in a pavilion of a brother's house.
[195]  Because the Lord had started something, it was easy for many people to be saved.
[196]  During the period between 1921 and 1923, revival meetings were held to lead people to the Lord.
[197]  At that time preaching the gospel was believed to be the unique work for God.
[198]  But God opened my eyes to see that His purpose requires that those who have been saved by grace stand upon the ground of oneness in local churches to represent and maintain God's testimony on earth.
[199]  I was not afraid of death but I could not help thinking of what I had learned from the Lord during the many years before and the lessons I had experienced, none of which had yet been put into writing.
[200]  When I arrived in Nanking, I learned that a number of brothers and sisters who were standing on the ground of unity in the local church broke bread together, so naturally I went to them and joined them in remembrance of the Lord.
[201]  This was not the so-called policy of exclusion, nor should it be taken to mean that we considered ourselves alone to be right; our only wish was to be loyal to the end. I wrote The Spiritual Man while I was ill; when it was completed, I became worse and was confined to bed practically all the time.
[202]  When I first became aware of my illness in 1924, I was feeling feeble, there was pain in my chest, and I had a slight fever.
[203]  Dr. H. S. Wong said to me, "I know you have faith and that God can cure you, but allow me to examine you and diagnose your disease." After the examination he spoke to Brother Wong Teng Ming for some time in a very low voice.
[204]  But when I informed them that I was not afraid, Dr. Wong told me that I was afflicted with tuberculosis and that my condition was so serious that prolonged rest would be necessary.
[205]  I could not sleep that night; I did not want to meet the Lord without having completed my work.
[206]  For half a year I could not grasp the Lord's will, but there was joy in my heart, and I believed the Lord could never be wrong.
[207]  I felt that even though I might not live long, I should believe that God would increase my strength and that I must work for Him.
[208]  My concept had been that one should not write books until he was old, but when I considered that I might be leaving this earth, I felt I should begin writing.
[209]  When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.
[210]  From the time I was bedridden by illness until the time I was healed by God, I was being shown more clearly the kind of work God wanted me to do.
[211]  Before I became ill, I not only visited various places to conduct special meetings, but I also had a great ambition to compose a good comprehensive commentary.
[212]  After completing The Spiritual Man, which I began in Nanking when I became ill, I realized that the task of expounding the Scriptures was not for me.
[213]  After my illness, God revealed to me that the central point of the messages He gave me was not for expounding the Scriptures, preaching the ordinary gospel, paying attention to prophecies, or anything outward, but for laying stress on the living word of life.
[214]  CHAPTER THREE THE THIRD TESTIMONY Given on October 20, 1936 Scripture Reading: Acts 26:29 LIVING A LIFE OF FAITH
[215]  Having given two testimonies, I had no intention of giving any more.
[216]  However, while I was praying, it seemed that the Lord wanted me to testify once again.
[217]  Those who know me are aware that I seldom testify regarding my own affairs.
[218]  I have pointed out in a previous testimony that after I was saved I continued to study in school and at the same time work for the Lord.
[219]  But you will expect me to earn money in the future and support you in return, and I must tell you beforehand that since I am going to be a preacher, I will not be able to repay you in the future nor pay you interest.
[220]  To the best of my knowledge, Sister Dora Yu was the only preacher at that time who did not receive a salary and who depended wholly upon God for her living.
[221]  Yet when I looked to the Lord, He said to me, "If you cannot live by faith, you cannot work for Me."
[222]  When once I found that there was only about ten dollars in my wallet, which before long would be fully spent, I suddenly recalled the widow of Zarephath, who had only a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse 1 Kings 17:12 .
[223]  I prayed to the Lord again, "O Lord, if You really want me to give away five dollars, I will," but I was still rather unwilling inwardly.
[224]  This time I had a feeling of certainty in my heart, recalling that before I left Foochow, God had asked me to give five dollars to a co-worker, which I then begrudged giving.
[225]  Then he said, "When you get back to Foochow, I will give you The Dynamics of Service written by Mr. Padgett Wilkes, a gospel messenger greatly used by the Lord in Japan." I soon felt that I had missed a great opportunity; what I needed then was money for traveling expenses, not a book.
[226]  I said to God, "If You order me to do anything else, I will do it, but I am unwilling to confess to her."
[227]  When I prayed to God, He told me that I am not like a Christian, for I have never done well in the matter of offering, and that I love money too much.
[228]  I have long been thinking of writing to you, but I have put it off lest my thoughts were not sufficiently mature to do so.
[229]  I hope what I am going to say below will, through the grace of the Lord, help towards changing the situation there.
