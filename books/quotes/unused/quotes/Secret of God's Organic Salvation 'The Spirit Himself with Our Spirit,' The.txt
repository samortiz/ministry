1) The generating Spirit in our spirit, quickened by Christ, regenerates us, giving us authority to be the children of God, begotten of God
2) The nourishing Spirit in our spirit, cherished by Christ, feeds us with the spiritual milk of the Word that we may grow unto salvation
3) The sanctifying Spirit from our spirit, captivated by Christ, sanctifies us with the nature of God, making us holy unto God
4) The renewing Spirit in our spirit, indwelt by Christ, renews us that we may put on the new man through the breaking of the cross
5) The transforming Spirit in our spirit, filled by Christ, transforms us into the glorious image of Christ for His expression
6) The building Spirit in our spirit, possessed by Christ, builds us into the house of God and the Body of Christ for Their dwelling
7 The maturing Spirit in our spirit enriched with Christ conforms us to the image of Christ the firstborn Son of Godthe model of Gods sons
8) The sealing Spirit in our spirit, exulting with Christ, saturates us with and brings us into the glory of God for our glorification
Our deadened spirit was redeemed by Christ and, having been redeemed, it has been quickened, enlivened, by the Spirit, who regenerated us
When we speak of the Spirit with our spirit, we mean that the consummated Spirit is with the believers' created and regenerated spirit
In these messages we are using the word secret as a noun meaning skillfulness in doing things or in making things
The Second of the Divine Trinity, the Son, came to seek the lost sinners outside of them objectively as a shepherd seeks his lost sheep
Whereas the Son's seeking is objective on the cross, the Spirit's seeking is subjective and within the sinner's heart
God has a way to rescue us, and this rescue is a matter of righteousness, which is not only of Christ but which is Christ Himself
The Spirit's coming to convict concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment involves three persons-Adam, Christ, and Satan
Sin entered through Adam , righteousness is the resurrected Christ , and judgment is for Satan , who is the author and source of sin
The Spirit convicts sinners that they may be born anew of water and of the Spirit in their spirit enlivened by Christ in resurrection
The only other place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium
The Pentecostal people talk much about the baptism of the Spirit but say little, if anything, about drinking the Spirit
The life-giving Spirit as the living water is the Spirit flowing as the river of water of life from the throne of the Triune God
The living water which the Lord Jesus gives to a believer regenerated by Him becomes a spring of water gushing up into eternal life
God is the fountain, the Spirit of Jesus is the spring, and we, the believers, are the ones in whom the spring is gushing up
The Spirit regenerates us in our spirit, and then He witnesses with our spirit that we, the regenerated ones, are the children of God
The regenerated believers in Christ are not part of a company going to heaven; they are a part of the bride of Christ
The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride is a composition of all the regenerated believers
Every child of God should learn to worship God, who is Spirit, with his regenerated spirit mingled with God's Spirit as one spirit
In this message we will cover two sections of God's organic salvation-the section of feeding and the section of sanctification
We feed them through cherishing them to pray-read the word and call on the Lord by exercising their spirit cherished by Christ
When we are cherished by Christ, first we feel happy, and then spontaneously we exercise our spirit to pray, calling on the Lord
Reasonings are of our mind and come mainly from the brothers, whereas murmurings are of the emotion and come mainly from the sisters
Christ as the great Shepherd shepherds God's flock in resurrection for their perfection to do God's will within them
The believers can do God's will within them by being perfected through the shepherding of Christ in resurrection
Our soul needs Christ's shepherding with His observation, oversight, and correction so that we may be strengthened
Christ Himself is the Shepherd, and He has established elders in the churches and has charged them to shepherd 'the flock of God'
The first responsibility of the elders is to shepherd God's flock, the church, not to take care of business affairs
The elders should leave the business affairs to the deacons, the serving ones, and devote more time to shepherding
In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul says that 'those who labor in word and teaching' should be counted worthy of double honor
The elders should labor not in the business affairs but in word and teaching, shepherding God's flock by teaching faithfully
Peter 1:2 speaks of 'the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ'
In verse 8 the seeking Spirit is likened to a woman who lit a lamp, swept the house, and sought carefully until she found the lost coin
Regarding the three aspects of God's sanctification we need to remember three words: initially, judicially, and organically
We became fallen from God, and we were lost in our position and in our nature , becoming common, a very serious matter
In God's organic salvation we are being sanctified in our disposition with the divine, holy nature of God that we may be holy unto God
The Holy Spirit is sanctifying us also with the element of the resurrection life of Christ, which we received through the feeding
The more we feed on the Word, the more we receive the element of the resurrection life of Christ for our dispositional sanctification
We acknowledge that You are the Lord of all that You are the speaking God and that You are the Spirit who dispenses Your life into our being
All the regenerated believers have been created into one new man in Christ ; hence, they are God's new creation
We may regard ourselves as quite good, but whether we are good or bad, we are of the old creation, and thus we need to be renewed
Regeneration lays the foundation of the divine life upon which the renewing continues to build up the divine life within a believer
In regeneration a new life, the divine life, is added to our natural life, causing these two lives to become one
In renewing the mingled spirit penetrates our troublesome mind, causing it to be changed and even to become the mind of Christ
We, the regenerated saints, as parts of the new man and as God's new creation should walk in the newness of the divine life in resurrection
Much of the believers environmental suffering is related to their family life to their daily life with their spouse children and relatives
God arranges our environment so that little by little and day by day our outer man will be consumed and our inner man will be renewed
The believers must be thoroughly and absolutely renewed that they may be practically the genuine new creation of God and for God
The believers should be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem since they all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem
Since the New Jerusalem will be constituted with the believers, they need to be thoroughly and absolutely renewed
On the one hand, the old 'I' has been crucified; on the other hand, there is a new 'I,' and this new 'I' lives by the faith of Christ
Transformation is accomplished by the Lord Spirit , transforming the believers into the image of the glory of Christ
We have God's life, God's nature, God's mind, and the divine element of all His riches, and now we can participate in God's divinity in full
He is making us God in His life, in His nature, in His thinking, and in His expression but not, of course, in His Godhead
For God to work Himself into us in such a way is not merely to make us holy and it is not merely to make us perfect victorious and spiritual
God is working His life, nature, mind, and element into us in order to make us God in life, in nature, in mind, and in expression
Our oneness to which we testify in the Lords table meeting is according to the divine oneness which is an attribute of the Divine Trinity
We need not only to have the oneness but also to be in sweet harmony with other believers and to be in one accord with the Body in prayer
The believers need to practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does
Some claim to be practicing the oneness of the Body, but they are actually practicing a sectarian, factious oneness
The three of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are continually practicing the divine oneness
The oneness of the Father and the Son includes the Spirit, who is the consummation and totality of the Triune God
We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine life with its source, the divine name of the Father
We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity also by the divine word as the truth that sanctifies the believers from the world
Anyone who does not have the divine life and nature is not a son of God, for such a one does not have the divine sonship
We keep this oneness in the constitution of the Body with the Divine Trinity as the source , the element , and the essence
We also keep this oneness through the perfection by the gifted members for the building up of the Body of Christ
If we would enter into the building, we need to magnify Christ through living Him by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The New Testament reveals that although Christ surely is building the church, He is not the only builder of the divine building
The first builder is Christ the Head, who speaks the words of God, imparts the divine life, and gives the Spirit without measure
The gifted persons, especially the apostles and the prophets, perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ
If He is to make His home in your heart, you need to be strengthened by God the Father with power and through His Spirit into your inner man
Christ's making His home in our heart results in our being filled unto all the fullness of God for His universal expression
The foundation is also the apostles and the prophets with their revelation received of Christ as the rock and their teaching
The materials of the divine building are the Divine Trinity as the transformed precious items-gold, silver, and precious stones
Silver or bdellium and pearl signify Christ in His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection
The materials also include the transformed believers who are the divine plants transformed into the divine minerals
You should build only with the precious materials, that is, with the Triune God and with the transformed believers
The work of the divine building is the believers' growth in the divine life and their being joined together in the divine life
The building is also by the Spirit's operation, distributing to each member different gifts for the building up of the Body
When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will send His angels to collect all the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them
All the churches are one Body, and the co-workers should be doing not a regional work but a universal work for the universal Body
Those who blow the wind of divisive teachings by stressing things other than the central teaching concerning God's economy
When some hear that there are destroyers of the divine building, they may say, 'Is this not the divine building, the building of God?
We thank You that we also have the divine mind, the mind of Christ, and by this also we participate in God's divinity
God's intention is to make man like Him in His divine life, in His divine nature, and in His image as His expression, but not in His Godhead
We are more blessed than the angels, for they are merely God's servants, but we are God's sons, possessing God's divinity
We have to be fully matured in order to be a fully grown man at the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ
His humanity did not need to be redeemed but His humanity which died on the cross needed to be sanctified enlivened uplifted and transformed
Through resurrection the Lord's dead humanity was sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed into the divine sonship
The firstborn Son of God was therefore begotten of God with both divinity and humanity, and we are being conformed to His image
Whereas the inner saturating is a lifelong process, our being brought into God's glory outwardly will be instantaneous
The day is coming when our body will be redeemed and we will enter into the full enjoyment of the divine sonship
The word redemption indicates that the redemption of the body is judicial because the believers' redeemed body is of the fallen old creation
The divine glorification of the glorified believers makes the consummated believers participate in God's divinity to the uttermost
Gods goal in these eight sections of His organic salvation is simply to make us God that is to make us a duplication a xerox copy of God
At that time we will have God's life, God's nature, God's mind, God's being, and God's glory and we will bear God's image
When our body is redeemed and transfigured and we thereby enjoy the highest portion of the divine sonship we will be able to say Hallelujah!
The secret of the intensified work of God's organic salvation is something in addition to God's organic salvation
In order for God's economy to be completed and consummated, that is, for God to have the New Jerusalem, something further is needed
Christians often say that Christ's ministry is of two parts or sections-His earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry
Christ's ministry in this section is altogether organic, for it is carried out by Him in His resurrection life
The first section of Christ's ministry was judicial, the second section is organic, and the third section is sevenfold intensified
Alexander the coppersmith who might have been quite close to Paul did many evil things to the apostle and greatly opposed the apostles words
Many deceivers as antichrists, not confessing that Christ came in the flesh, taught beyond the teaching of Christ
At the end of the ministry of the three main writers of the New Testament-Paul, Peter, and John-there was degradation
Because of this degradation, the life-giving Spirit, that is, the pneumatic Christ, had to be intensified sevenfold
Christ as the life-giving Spirit was intensified to be the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit
When you look at someone, your eyes look at that one, and when your eyes look at someone, you yourself look at that one
The fact that the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ the Lamb indicates that Christ and the Spirit are one
Just as the eyes of a person are not separate from the person, so the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of Christ are not separate from Christ
As a result of this infusing, the brother has the supply to go to his wife, confess, and ask for her forgiveness
As the sevenfold intensified Spirit Christ saves the believers from the things related to the degradation of the church
Those who are defeated in the way described in verses 10 and 11 may taste of the second death, the lake of fire
We need to realize, therefore, that it is possible for a saved person to be hurt by the lake of fire as the second death
The believers need to be saved from the spiritual death-from being dead and dying-in Protestantism, signified by the church in Sardis
Some in Brethrenism had gained the crown but eventually were defeated and were in danger of losing the crown at the Lord's coming back
We know that the church in Laodicea was Christless by the fact that He was outside the church, standing at the door and knocking
At the beginning of each of the seven epistles it is Christ who is speaking but at the end of each epistle it is the Spirit who is speaking
Christ saves the believers also by the participation of the overcoming saints who are living in their spirit drawn by the Lamb
Without the overcomers the Body of Christ cannot be built up and unless the Body of Christ is built up Christ cannot come back for His bride
Christ will come back not only as the Savior but also as the Bridegroom to marry His bride, who will be the totality of the overcomers
The building up of the Body of Christ is by the overcomers produced by God in the intensified work of His organic salvation
John 3 indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom coming for the bride, who is composed of all the regenerated people
The overcomers produced by Christ's intensified work will build up the Body of Christ, which will become the bride of Christ
At the end of this age Antichrist and his false prophet will rise up to be the top enemies of Christ in humanity
Christ's intensified work is for the binding of Satan and the casting of him into the abyss for one thousand years
Finally, Christ's intensified work is for the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ and of God which will be the millennium
The believer who is joined to the Lord can experience the Lord to the climax, even to be one spirit with the Lord
