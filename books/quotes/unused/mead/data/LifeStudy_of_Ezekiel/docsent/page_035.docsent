   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second aspect of the practical condition of coordination is walking according to the Spirit Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The living creatures follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever the Spirit goes, there the living creatures go also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that if we, as living creatures in Christ, would be coordinated, we must walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not follow ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we deny ourselves and walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 , we will have genuine coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if we walk in an arbitrary way according to self-will and if we live in the flesh, we cannot coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moving Straight Forward</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and Accommodating Others</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another aspect of the practical condition of coordination is moving straight forward and accommodating others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the living creatures move, they go straight forward; they do not make any turns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If one living creature takes the lead to move straight forward toward the east, the other living creatures also move in this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that everyone functions properly in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church life today, every member has his own function 1 Cor 12:14-30 and moves in a straight forward direction to fulfill his function, without turning to do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As one of the four living creatures moves forward in a particular direction, the others accommodate him by moving in the same direction, walking backward, sideways to the right, or sideways to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only one living creature at a time can move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in moving with him, the others do not turn; rather, they walk backward or sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regardless of the direction in which the living creatures move, one moves forward, one moves backward, and the others move sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, those who move backward and sideways accommodate the one who moves forward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This should be the situation in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often we need to move backward or sideways in order to accommodate the one who is moving forward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the meetings or in the practical service, as someone is exercising his function, moving forward, we need to accommodate him by moving either backward or sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if everyone goes his own way and does not accommodate others, we cannot be a corporate entity and we cannot coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The move of the living creatures is not individual it is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The living creatures move by coordinating together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would participate in such a coordination, we need to deny ourselves, experience God s grace, and follow the Spirit in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that in the Bible the clearest picture of coordination is found in chapter one of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A central feature of the vision of the four living creatures is their coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see not the move of an individual living creature but the corporate move of four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This portrays the move not of believers in an individual way but of the church in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We, the living ones who are in the grace and power of God, have become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone has his ministry and carries out his proper function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that everyone goes forward in his own direction without making any turns.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the directions may differ, the move is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When someone goes toward the north, all the others follow him to move in this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If someone else moves south, all the others move with him toward the south.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever someone is moving forward, all the others accommodate him by moving either backward or sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we study the clear picture of the coordination of the living creatures in Ezekiel 1, we will understand what coordination is.</S>
