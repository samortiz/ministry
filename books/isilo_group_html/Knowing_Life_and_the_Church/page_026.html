<p>The third thing that the church should not have is special fellowships. This also causes confusion and division. Among Christians, there are groups that insist on everyone having the same beliefs. For instance, if they believe there is one rapture before the great tribulation, they insist that everyone must believe that Christians will be raptured before the great tribulation. This fellowship is a special fellowship, not a common fellowship. In proper circumstances, as the children of God with the same Father, we can have fellowship with one another in the Father&rsquo;s life (1 John 1:3). However, some Christians will not fellowship with those who do not share their views, beliefs, and feelings. Their fellowship is a special fellowship which has been brought in by man; it is outside of Christ.</p>
<p>Having special names, special beliefs, and special fellowships are three main factors that cause division and confusion in the church. If a group has any of these, it loses both the nature and the ground of the church. If any Christian group has a special name, special belief, or special fellowship, it immediately loses the ground of the church because there is only one church in the universe, and there is also only one expression of the church in each locality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Being the Greatest Hindrance to the Church</h2>
<p>In addition to the preceding three matters, being independent is another serious point concerning the church. Some Christian groups do not violate the three matters above; that is, they do not have special names, special beliefs, or special fellowships, but they are independent. Since they do not have special names, special beliefs, and special fellowships, their condition should be quite normal. However, they remain individualistic and independent; they do not have fellowship with the saints in other localities and even do not recognize such fellowship. This is another great problem brought in by the things of man.</p>
<p>If we know that the church is Christ and that the church and Christ are one, we will see the seriousness of this matter; the church is a strong test to us. Today the church has lost her nature and the proper ground because the things of man have been brought into the church.</p>
<p>The saints are lovable and love the Lord very much. Nevertheless, when we touch the matter of the church, a few say, &ldquo;I think this matter should be done this way, and that matter should be done that way.&rdquo; It seems as if things should be done only according to their preferences. These are human words; they are the things of man which should not be brought into the church. There are so many divisions in today&rsquo;s Christianity because many people bring their own views and preferences into the church. When we speak of the matter of names, for example, some people say that having a name is good, and they even have a list of names that can be used. They speak in a very light and loose way, and sects are produced.</p>
<p>If we do not touch the matter of the church, everything is fine; however, once we touch the matter of the church, our whole being should be in awe because the church and Christ are one. Anything that is apart from Christ is not the church. Therefore, the church does not have anything that is of you, me, or any man. The only things that can be brought into the church must be of Christ and must be Christ (Col. 3:10-11). Whenever we bring our own things, our own views, our own preferences, opinions, intents, desires, and ways into the church, the church is nullified. All of these cause the church to lose her nature and the local ground of oneness.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to see that the reason there is so much confusion and division in Christianity is because believers do not want to submit and prostrate themselves before the church. Man&rsquo;s views, intentions, inclinations, and preferences have come into the church, and these things result in different sects. When believers who love and seek the Lord are willing to prostrate themselves, putting aside the things of man, their eyes will be opened to see the ground of the church. Today the most difficult problem is for the things that are apart from Christ to be put aside; instead, believers continue to hold on to these things rather than to Christ. This is the greatest frustration to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE TESTS FOR EXAMINING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we touch the matter of the church, we should not simply look at the outward things. We also need to touch the church&rsquo;s inward essence. It is easy for us to bring our own opinions, preferences, ways, and practices into the church life. This is a big problem. Some may ask, &ldquo;How can we be certain that what we bring into the church is not something of man?&rdquo; There are three tests in this regard. The first test is the Bible. We must consider whether our actions, including our thoughts, views, activities, and practices, are according to the Bible. Whatever does not match the Bible is certainly something of man. If something does not match the Bible, we cannot allow it into the church. We need to filter everything with the Bible so that we can keep out everything that is not according to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, it is not sufficient simply to test everything by the Bible. We need another test, and that is to examine whether the things we are bringing into the church are of Christ or of ourselves. The church is Christ, and the content of the church is also Christ. Everything in the church should be Christ. We should examine ourselves to see whether the things we bring into the church are of Christ or of ourselves.</p>
<p>The third test is the Holy Spirit. We need to pass through the test of the Holy Spirit. We need to ask ourselves if what we are bringing into the church is under the ruling of the Spirit in us or if it is from our own decision. Is it from the operation of the Spirit in us, or is it from our own opinion? This is the root of every problem.</p>
<p>Today the churches in most localities can pass the first test; their condition is according to the Bible. Nevertheless, when we examine them according to the second test, we have to admit that many of their ways are not necessarily of Christ; probably, they are related to the things of man. If we examine them with the third test, we discover even more problems. The activities in some local churches are mainly the work of the flesh; we cannot see the authority of the Holy Spirit in these activities. Outwardly, they are according to the Bible, but in reality, the flesh is moving and reigning, and the Holy Spirit has no authority among them.</p>
<p>When we examine the church, we need to examine her from within and without, according to these things, to determine whether it has a special name, special belief, or special fellowship. Are they an independent unit or an independent group? Are their activities according to the Bible and of the Holy Spirit? If the results of these tests are positive, we can bow our heads and say, &ldquo;O Lord, I have met the church here.&rdquo; But if the results are negative, we should be very cautious.</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and the church is Christ Himself; thus, in the church there is nothing other than Christ. Everything in the church should be out of Christ and out of the Spirit. Moreover, every local church should have fellowship with the churches in other localities. I hope we all would see how to have the reality of the church in our practice of the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing Life and the Church &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
