   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD TAKING THE WAY OF RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should never think that we are one of the many groups in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The leading that the Lord has given us is different from what is in Christianity; we are His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity lost this way more than one thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord wants us to take the way of recovery in order to fulfill the words He has spoken in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Romans, the Lord spoke many deep things, but we do not see much of the reality of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not think that it is impossible for these words to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We believe that the words in the Bible, regardless of how deep, high, or mysterious they are, will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are not willing to cooperate with the Lord to allow His words to be accomplished in us in this age, He will delay His return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To the Lord one thousand years are as a day; if He delays his coming for one thousand years, He will come one day later.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord has great patience, and He has endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The day will come when He will fulfill His word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May we be those who have received the grace and the blessing to allow the Lord to pass through us in this age so that His word can be accomplished and fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God desires to gain a group of people who are clear concerning the truth and who have growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also desires to obtain the church life as the expression of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are preaching the gospel, speaking the truth, and leading people to salvation so that they may receive grace and enlightenment to be a part of the golden lampstand for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We believe that this is what the Lord wants us to do, and we also believe that if we are faithful, the Lord s grace will take us on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We truly are blessed people because the recovery is not what it was in the time of Martin Luther or what it was three hundred years ago or even what it was one hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every generation in the Lord s recovery surpasses the generation preceding it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope that the younger generation will surpass us and will constantly follow the Lord and advance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their ability to surpass us depends on the truth, life, the church life, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Truth, life, and the church are the foundation, and the gospel is for spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is only by having truth, life, and the church that we will be able to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OUR EMPHASES IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are a few more points for us to fellowship about.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, our feeling toward the church is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not think that we are great gospel preachers who can bring one hundred people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A believer with this attitude is finished; in other words, he has killed himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that we are tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the Lord s mercy and grace if He uses us in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be humble and understand that everything we have is in the church and that the result of all our labor must be turned over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the church can preserve us and balance us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as we do not have the church life, we are on our own, and we are in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, if we do anything special on our own, we will wither, because it will result in division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is only one Body of Christ, and there is only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we must lay a firm foundation in truth, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The firmer the foundation is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will not suffer, nor will we be in any danger when we go out to preach the gospel, even if we lead tens of thousands of people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, we must always remember that there must not be parties in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not say that Apollos is higher than Paul or that Paul is deeper than Peter or even that Peter is older and more experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not make such distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must see that Paul is for us, Peter is for us, and Apollos is also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul said that all are ours 1 Cor 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We thank the Lord that He gave us Peter and Apollos and Paul; they are for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we say that we are following the way of Paul or that we belong to Peter or to Apollos, we have brought division into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This has been church history.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot afford to take that way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BEING HUMBLE IN LEARNING FROM OTHERS,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>IN NOT CRITICIZING OTHERS,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IN BEING HARMONIOUS IN ALL THINGS,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND IN NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Lord s recovery we must be humble in order to learn from others, to not criticize others, to be harmonious in all things, and to not cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must love all the churches and all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must continually maintain such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Lord s recovery we are one, and everyone has his function.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The elderly saints have their function, and the young saints have their function.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must thank the Lord that He gave us Paul, Apollos, and Peter ; we must receive the supply from them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We absolutely cannot say, I am for Paul, or I am for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must not allow other saints to take sides with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must condemn any situation that results in the saints in a locality beginning to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not want people to follow us, nor do we want to follow men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, we are for the Lord s recovery, and we love the Lord s recovery, all the churches, and all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We receive whoever can give us help, and we help whomever we are able to help.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Wherever we go, we do not criticize, nor do we say, This church is not as good as another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must not have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some churches have more growth and others have less, but we should not discuss this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our attitude must be that we are here to supply others with the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must also be humble, and we must receive the supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must always be willing to learn no matter where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If there is something that can help us, we should learn from it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same manner, wherever we go, we must supply others and receive the supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the way for everyone s spirit to be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot expect that every local church will have the same growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not even have such an expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be one to harmoniously supply the saints wherever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Moreover, we should not focus only on our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord has given us a portion, which we must take care of, but we must not push others aside or trample on their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must remember that the Lord has richly given every member to the church and that every member has the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For example, even the little finger has its use.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All the members have the riches of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, we must treasure all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>PRACTICING THE SMALL GROUPS TO GAIN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>AND ALL THE MEMBERS BEARING THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>OF SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we want the church to continue to spread, every saint must pick up the responsibility to shepherd and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We will form small groups in every district, and every group will have twelve people, just as the Lord Jesus had twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the one hand, we will preach the gospel, and on the other hand, we will lead and perfect a few saints.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the number of saints in a group becomes too many, the group will split.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This means that when those whom we have perfected learn how to lead others, they will go out to do the same things that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In this matter, we do not need to wait for the church to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Instead, we should begin to take care of a few saints and gradually increase the number of those under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>On the one hand, we will preach the gospel, and on the other hand, we will take care of the saints by feeding them as our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The saints who have been under our care for one year will have some spontaneous growth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The goal of leading people to salvation is to bring them into the church so that they will be established in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, we need to support those whom we lead to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we do not support them, we will lead people to salvation with one hand and allow them to slip away through our other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not bear children and then neglect to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After we beget, we must feed our children and bring them into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Newly saved ones need to be led for some time before they will be stable in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is our goal.</S>
