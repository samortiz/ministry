   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REVIEW OF THE MOVE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to church history, the first meeting of the church was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church there was raised up and established by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the beginning there was a large number of saved ones in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the record in Acts, one hundred twenty disciples prayed in one accord in the upper room for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out, and three thousand people heard the gospel and were saved 1:13-14; 2:1-4, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the first church was raised up, three thousand people were added to it on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not long after Pentecost, another five thousand men believed in the Lord on another day 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, Acts does not say much about how the service in the early church in Jerusalem was carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The saints did not have their own meeting hall; they met in the temple and from house to house 2:46; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 46 of chapter 2 says that all those who believed met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These words in Greek are specific.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the very beginning the church in Jerusalem had their meetings in the homes of the eight thousand saved ones; the saints met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what the book of Acts reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The record in Acts does not show another church that had as many believers as the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, it is difficult to find a pattern of a large church in the New Testament; the New Testament does not record another church that had more than a thousand believers or that had more than ten thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, it is difficult to know how to build up a local church that has a large number of saints and how to spread in such a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though there were numerous revivals in church history, it is difficult to find a record that indicates that a church had several thousand or tens of thousands of believers meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is difficult for us to find a pattern for the administration of a large church from church history.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s Recovery in China</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first church was raised up in Foochow in 1920.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the beginning there were only three saints, and they met in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, even though they were only three, they quickly increased to ten and then to more than twenty believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After they increased to about one hundred, they did not have further increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number of saints in the church remained at around one hundred for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1927 we spread from Foochow to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After five years in Shanghai, in 1932 we spread up to the north and began meeting in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meetings in Chefoo began in the living room of my home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were eleven of us at our first bread-breaking meeting, and we sat around an old-fashioned Chinese square table.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord s mercy, our numbers increased to one hundred in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The strange thing is that when we reached about one hundred, it was difficult for us to increase further.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For eleven years, from 1922 to 1933, the number of saints in every church from Foochow in the south to Shanghai and on up to Chefoo in the north was about one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One hundred is not a large number, but when our numbers first reached one hundred, we wanted to celebrate, because we thought that it was a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is easier to administrate, to lead, and to shepherd a church with this many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason the churches stopped increasing when they reached one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The number of new believers we would baptize never exceeded forty at one time; at the most there were thirty-seven or thirty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was in 1940, in Chefoo, that we received light to promote the whole church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The term the church preaching the gospel was first used in 1940 in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as we began to practice the whole church preaching the gospel, the number of saved ones increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During the second year of the whole church preaching the gospel, we received a great blessing many were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first time we baptized more than one hundred twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we had baptisms every month for at least four consecutive months.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We baptized one hundred people, then around ninety, and then around eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result of the four times that we had baptisms, several hundred new ones were brought in. From that time onward, the number of saints in the church increased greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chefoo is my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church raised up by the Lord in that locality began meeting in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the church in Chefoo was raised up in 1932, our numbers increased to over a hundred saints in the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, I felt that I needed to leave my job to serve full time in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In August 1933 I left my job.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In October I made a special trip to Shanghai to visit the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I first arrived in Shanghai, there were no more than one hundred fifty saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The city of Shanghai is huge, and the meeting hall was located in the west on Hardoon Road.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since some of the brothers and sisters lived in the northwest district of the city, there was the need to meet in two places.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later, they had another meeting hall in the northwest district, besides the meeting hall on Hardoon Road.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The total number of saints in both places was not more than one hundred fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was not until after 1940 that there was a church in the Lord s recovery, the church in Chefoo, where the number of saints increased from a little over one hundred to several hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Soon afterward the War in the Pacific broke out, and there was a great change in the domestic situation, and many brothers and sisters moved inland.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, churches were raised up in the inland areas around Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There were very few saints in these localities.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church in Shanghai had to temporarily close its doors and stop meeting because Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the Chinese victory over the Japanese, the church in Shanghai resumed its meetings in 1946.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Initially, there were less than a hundred saints in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the summer of that year, I was invited back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I arrived, there were less than ninety saints in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Later, the brothers suggested that I move my family from northern China to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So at the end of 1946, I moved my family to Shanghai, and I also began traveling between Shanghai and Nanking to work in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the beginning of 1947 I began to lead the saints in Shanghai into the practice of the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This practice was successful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church preached the gospel during the Chinese New Year holiday, and more than one hundred people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For the next two or three months, many people were baptized every month.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the way we had a great increase in the number of saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church in Shanghai had a slightly longer history than the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It also had a considerable number of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, due to the political situation, from 1942 to 1946 the doors to the meeting hall were closed, and the saints were unable to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a result, the saints were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nevertheless, the meetings were resumed in 1946, and in the beginning of 1947 a revival occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By the summer of that year, several hundred new ones had been added and most of the original saints, who had been dormant, came back to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In 1947 there were more than one thousand saints meeting in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since the saints were spread out all over Shanghai, we felt that we should begin district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>So in the summer of that year we separated into sixteen different districts for the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After more than one year of meeting in districts, our numbers increased even more.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In 1949, due to another change in the political situation, the Lord led me to leave Shanghai and come to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>During the time that I was in mainland China, there was only one locality that had over one thousand saints, and that was the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All the matters related to service were divided among the sixteen district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every district meeting had from a few dozen to one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This was the largest number of saints that we had in one locality in the work in mainland China.</S>
