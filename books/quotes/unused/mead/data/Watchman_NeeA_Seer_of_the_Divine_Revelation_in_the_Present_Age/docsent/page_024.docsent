   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE LIVING BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the very beginning, Watchman Nee realized fully that he should live by faith, not only for his living, but also for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus he learned to trust in the Lord for all his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This forced him to pray much, to consecrate himself to the Lord absolutely, to thoroughly deal with the Lord, and to obey the Lord in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to trust God in a living and practical way, he needed to keep his conscience free of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He would often say that a hole in our conscience would cause our faith to leak out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Living by faith kept him in the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When living and working by our own means, we do not need to be restricted and limited by the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can do whatever we like, whenever we like, without needing to seek the Lord's will or to wait for His guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But to live by faith requires us to be restricted to the Lord's will; otherwise, when we pray in faith He will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will never support us and supply our need in anything we are doing according to our own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through living by faith, Watchman Nee was preserved from being distracted by the outward appearance of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What he cared for was the Lord's will, not a booming work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His desire was to live by a faith that God would honor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that if he performed any work which was not done in life and according to God's will, God would never respond to his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, both his personal life and his work were continually under restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Down through the years, he continually exercised himself to live such a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In China he pioneered such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He became a strong example for all his close associates who had been called by the Lord to live and work for Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WATCHMAN NEE'S PERSONAL TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GIVEN AT KULANGSU, FUKIEN,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OCTOBER 20, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While praying last night, it seemed that the Lord wanted me to testify once again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who know me are aware that I seldom testify regarding my own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has been my observation that people often abuse others' testimonies, treating them as news for circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also true that some testimonies are not sufficiently founded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The third heaven experience of the apostle Paul was not disclosed to others until after fourteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regarding many spiritual testimonies, an appropriate length of time should be allowed to elapse before they are divulged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many, however, would speak them forth not in fourteen years, but in fourteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matters concerning Money</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The matter of money can be either a small or a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I began to serve the Lord, I was somewhat anxious about the question of my livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Had I been a preacher in a denomination, I would have been on a large monthly salary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But since I was to walk in the Lord's way, I would only rely upon Him to support me; I could not depend upon a monthly salary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the years 1921 and 1922, very few preachers in China lived in sole reliance on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was difficult to find even two or three; the great majority lived on salary.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time many preachers were not bold enough to devote their entire time to serving the Lord; they felt that if they were not receiving a regular salary, they would not know how to face a situation in which they had nothing to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I also had such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In China today 1936 there are approximately fifty brothers and sisters in fellowship with us who live by relying solely on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a situation is more common now than it was in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters in various places today also care for the workers more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I think that after ten years or so, brothers and sisters will show even greater concern for the need of the servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it was not very common ten years ago.</S>
