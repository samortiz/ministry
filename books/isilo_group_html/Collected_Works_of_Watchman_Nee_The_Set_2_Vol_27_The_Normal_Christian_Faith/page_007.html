The man forcefully and vehemently denied the existence of God. With enthusiasm he gave more than ten reasons, one after another, to prove the nonexistence of God. After he finished speaking, he asked, "Is there any one of you who would like to object? Please come up here."</p><p>For a while there was silence. The missionary decided that he should say something. He stood up and told the crowd, "Friends, I cannot give many reasons. I can only give facts and tell you a story. Yesterday I was walking along the bank of the big river which, as you all know, is very rapid and leads to a treacherous waterfall. I was at the bank and I heard a man shouting for help. He distinctly cried, `O God! Save me!' I ran toward the sound and found a man in the midst of the river tumbling toward the waterfall. Without hesitation or thought of danger, I jumped into the river. The torrent was rapid, and I fought hard to keep myself from being swept under. Fortunately, I was quite strong. With one arm around him and the other swimming through the water, I managed to drag him ashore. After I did this, I felt quite happy. Do you know who the man who was crying to God for help is? Let me introduce him to you." At these words he pointed towards the man who just made the speech. "The one who called on God yesterday," he concluded, "is the same one who denies God today. This is what you call an atheist!"</p><p>All problems come from inside. When a man is on the border of life and death, he calls on God. When danger is over, he argues and denies God. In our heart we all know that there is a God; there is no question about it. We know it because there is a capacity for God. The capacity for God proves that there is God.</p><h2 class="head1">IS PRAYER ANSWERED?</h2><p>We should look not only at objective phenomena but also at our own subjective experience. We know that God answers prayers. Once I spoke to a person who resolutely denied the existence of God. I told him not to be too bold or presumptuous. The history of mankind is about five to six thousand years old. During this span of time, countless numbers of people both in Christianity and outside have prayed to God. Can you prove that not even one of these many prayers, throughout many years and among many people, has been answered? Are you so bold as to brush aside with one stroke the validity of all answers to prayers? These people prayed to heaven. Can you say that none of their prayers were answered? Let me testify that not only have there been one or two answers; there have been countless answers. Of course, one answer would suffice to prove the existence of God. Friends, do you think that there has never been an answer to prayer? Would you say that all answers to prayer are false? I personally have had at least two to three thousand answers to prayers. Is it conceivable to regard them all as mere coincidences? Many other people had their prayers answered. Are all those also coincidences?</p><p>Once a preacher was traveling across the Atlantic when a thick fog suddenly surrounded the ship. The vessel could not proceed and had to be anchored in the middle of the sea. The man went to the captain and said, "You have to hoist the sail again; I am scheduled to preach in Quebec on Tuesday." The captain replied, "Do you see the thick fog? It is impossible for the ship to proceed. If you can pray to dispel the fog, I will surely pull up my anchor." The preacher answered, "Go right ahead. I am going to pray right here while you pull up the anchor. There is no time to lose." He began to pray. The captain began to work on the anchor as the preacher prayed. When the anchor was up, the fog was gone. The ship arrived on time. Was this a coincidence?</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRUE GOD ANSWERS PRAYERS</h2><p>Once I went with a few brothers to a village to preach. Many people there said, "Our god is most powerful; he is called Dah-wang (i.e., the Great King). Once a year we hold a procession for him, and for years good weather always prevails that day. We have never had bad weather on that day." Prompted by God, one of us said, "Tomorrow when the procession goes on, it will certainly rain." The next day, the parade was scheduled for ten o'clock. But from nine o'clock in the morning, it rained heavily; the Great King was not able to come out, and the scheduled parade was called off. After much debate it was announced that as a result of careful calculation the day had been erroneously chosen; it should have been the fourteenth instead of the eleventh. We boldly declared that it would surely rain again on the fourteenth. The day came, and it did rain again. With no other choice, the people carried the statue of Dah-wang out for the procession. The bearers slipped on the way more than once, and Dah-wang fell and was broken to pieces. Was this a coincidence? There are innumerable incidents of this same nature. They are only a very small part of the Christian experience. If all the answers to prayers were enumerated, no one knows how big a volume it would take. These answers to prayers are a strong proof of the existence of God.</p><h2 class="head1">PARCEL FROM THE UNITED STATES</h2><p>When I was young I had a wild and stubborn mentality. Not only did I refuse to believe in a God, but I refused to even believe in a United States of America. After seeing its map I still did not believe that there was such a place. One day when my father was going to order some items from there, I casually put in an order for a pair of shoes and a toy boat. Later when he brought back a parcel from the post office and gave me the shoes and the toy boat, I began to believe in the reality of the United States because I saw with my own eyes the parcel from America. Years afterward when I was in Chicago, I purposely visited the department store from which I obtained my toy. Pointing to the building with my finger, I told myself that this was what made me believe in America.</p><p>I cannot give you a direct proof or a direct answer to the question of the existence of God. But I am presenting all these testimonies of answers to prayers. You should not be so bold to make a sweeping denial of God and a categorical rejection of the credibility of prayers.</p><h2 class="head1">CONTACTING GOD THROUGH PRAYER</h2><p>Once I met a student at Yenching University. He confessed to me, "When I was in high school, both the chaplain and the teachers taught me that there is a God, and I believed in Him. Later I went to college, and everybody said that there is no God. The world, they said, came into existence by natural evolution, and the universe was formed by chance. After so many people said the same thing, I became confused. For many months this problem troubled me. I had to choose one of the two possibilities. Is there a God, or is there not a God? At first I pondered the theory of chance. Is it conceivable that several things which are lumped together, shaken, and mixed with each other can result in a living human being? Is it conceivable that the whole world and even the whole universe were constituted in this fashion? I could not arrive at a conclusion with this kind of conjecture. Finally, I could not help but bow down on my knees and say, `O God, I do not know if You really exist. The more I think about it, the more I am confused. Please show me Yourself.' Two weeks after this prayer, I rejected the theory of chance and believed that there is a Creator. I cannot tell you why I made this decision. But I believe that God answered my prayer and led me to believe in Him." This is another case of prayer being answered. I know God too well. I have had dealings with Him numerous times, and too many transactions have been settled between Him and me. I know what I am saying. If you have ever touched God, you will know what I am saying also.</p><h2 class="head1">CAREFUL JUDGMENT</h2><p>Now what would you say? After looking at nature and the universe, after checking with your inner feeling, and after listening to the testimonies of so many witnesses, it is up to you to decide whether or not there is a God. But you should not be irresponsible; your attitude must be sober because everyone has to meet God soon. One day you will all stand before Him. Everything concerning yourself will be laid bare. On that day you will know God. But now is the time for you to be prepared. We should all be prepared to meet our God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 27: The Normal Christian Faith &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
