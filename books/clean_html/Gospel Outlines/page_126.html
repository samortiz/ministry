<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 5:30-32</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men are sinners
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men are born in sin, raised up in sin, and living in sin.</li>
	<li>Use examples to prove the sinful condition of men.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is the Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>His crucifixion on the cross has borne the sins of men.</li>
	<li>Having been raised from the dead, He has become the living Savior of men.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Repentant heart and redeeming grace
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since men have sins and the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption, God sends the Holy Spirit to move men to repentance. This repentant heart does not come from one&rsquo;s self but is given by God through the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li>The repentant heart firstly includes a turning of the mind toward God. Secondly, it includes regret and sorrow for sins. Thirdly, it includes confession before God. Fourthly, it includes a forsaking of sinful deeds.</li>
	<li>Redeeming grace comes by the redemption of Christ and is given to us through the Holy Spirit. When we repent, the Holy Spirit brings the peace of forgiveness of sins into our heart. This peace proves that we have received redeeming grace.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to have a repentant heart and the redeeming grace
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Do not harden your heart against the moving of the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit is moving in your heart. Do not harden your heart. You should soften your heart.</li>
	<li>Repent and confess your sins.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ and His redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
