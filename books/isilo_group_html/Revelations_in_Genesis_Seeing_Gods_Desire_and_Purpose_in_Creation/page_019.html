<p>The condition of the garden of Eden is similar to the condition of the New Jerusalem. The garden of Eden is a garden; the New Jerusalem is a city. Although a garden is different from a city, the content of the garden of Eden is similar to the content of the New Jerusalem. For example, the tree of life is in the garden of Eden, and the tree of life is also in the New Jerusalem. The water of life is in the garden of Eden, and the water of life is also in the New Jerusalem. The flow of the river in the garden issues in gold, bdellium, and precious stones. Gold, pearls, and precious stones are also in the New Jerusalem. The picture at the beginning of the Bible is seen at the conclusion of the Bible. This picture is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>If we are enlightened by God, we will realize that the garden of Eden in Genesis is the same as the New Jerusalem in Revelation. The only difference is that the garden of Eden is a miniature symbol, and the New Jerusalem is a full manifestation. When everything in the garden of Eden is fully manifested, we have the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If we know the Bible, we will understand that the garden of Eden is a very important place. The garden of Eden is the garden of God; it is a place where God is pleased and finds delight, a place where He can be satisfied. God&rsquo;s desire and purpose depend on man receiving His life. For this reason, God put man in the garden of Eden and also put the tree of life in the garden of Eden. Hence, the garden of Eden contains what is needed to accomplish God&rsquo;s desire and purpose.</p>
<p>When God put man in the garden of Eden, He wanted this man of dust to receive the tree of life, which signifies the life of God. No adjective can describe this life, because the life of God is unique. In the universe only the life of God can be considered as life, because the life of God is eternal and divine. Only the life of God possesses the nature of being eternal and divine. No other life is eternal or divine in nature, and no other life can attain to the standard of being eternal and divine. This is the unique life in the Bible.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:9 says that with God is the fountain of life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo;; that is, in Christ, the embodiment of God, was life. The embodiment of God said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10), and &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (11:25). First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; <em>Life</em> in these verses refers to the unique life of God. Therefore, God put man in front of the tree of life to show that He wanted man to receive His unique life.</p>
<p>In addition to the tree of life, in the garden of Eden there was a river. If we stood in front of the tree of life and watched the flowing river that issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stones, we would probably admire what we saw. Because we know that we are of dust, we might say, &ldquo;How can I, a man of dust, become gold, bdellium, and precious stone?&rdquo; Perhaps God would answer, &ldquo;Do you want to become gold, bdellium, and precious stone? Only the water of life can produce these precious materials. You must receive this life. When this life enters into you, it will flow within you as living water and will &lsquo;flow&rsquo; you, a man of dust, into gold.&rdquo; This is the revelation in this portion of the Bible.</p>
<p>The divine, eternal, and uncreated life of God is at the center of the universe, and we, as men of dust, are standing before this divine life. God&rsquo;s desire is that we would receive His life. On the one hand, this life is the fruit of life, and on the other hand, it is the living water of life. We can eat this life, and we can also drink it. When the water of life enters into us, it flows. It is wonderful that after flowing within us, it &ldquo;flows&rdquo; us, who are men of dust, into gold. This is spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:7, which says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; Earthen vessels are vessels of dust; our bodies were formed from the dust of the earth. The treasure is the life of God and is typified by gold, pearls, and precious stones. This treasure refers to God&rsquo;s element. When the life of God enters into us, it transforms our human life and nature until we become the same as God in life and nature, that is, until we become gold, pearls, and precious stones.</p>
<p>At the end of Revelation the men of dust become a city. In this city there is nothing other than gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the garden of Eden there was the Adam of dust, but in the New Jerusalem there is no man of dust. The men of dust have become a city of precious stones. There was no wall in the garden of Eden; there was only a keeper, a man of dust. Thus, &ldquo;foxes&rdquo; could enter at will. In the New Jerusalem, however, the keeper has become the wall. The Adam of dust has become a city of jasper. Everything in the New Jerusalem is precious stone; there is no longer anything of dust. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages has been to transform men of dust into gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the New Jerusalem God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We praise God because His doings are excellent and wonderful. He created man with a human spirit as a receiving organ so that man might receive His life (Gen. 2:7; cf. Job 32:8). On the one hand, His life is food, and on the other hand, His life is living water. When we receive the water of life, we are transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones by its flow. Even though man is the highest creature, he must receive the life of God in order to become a treasure. A person is noble, precious, and valuable when he has the life of God in him. If he lets the life of God flow through him, he becomes precious. When the life of God enters into us, it brings the element of God into us. Because God is exceedingly noble, precious, and indescribable, the gold, pearls, and precious stones signify God&rsquo;s noble and precious element. In order for men of dust to have the noble and precious element of God, we must let the life of God flow in us. This life transforms us to be as noble and precious as God is until we express God&rsquo;s glory and deal with His enemy. Then God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fulfilled, and God will be satisfied and at rest.</p>
<p>After man was created, he was put in front of life. This life is God Himself coming to be man&rsquo;s food and drink so that man may gain Him. Furthermore, this life will flow through man so that man may gain the element of gold, pearls, and precious stones. This is the meaning of the picture in Genesis 2.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:15 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.&rdquo; <em>To work</em> and <em>to keep</em> indicate man&rsquo;s responsibility. Verses 16 and 17 say, &ldquo;And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; This was a warning. The result of eating of the tree of life is life, but the result of eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. To eat is to receive; therefore, the result of receiving life is life, but the result of receiving the knowledge of good and evil is death.</p>
<p>The first step that God took in order to fulfill His purpose was to create man with a human spirit. The human spirit is an organ for man to contact and receive God. God created man with a spirit because He wants man to receive Him. Dogs, cattle, and sheep do not have a spirit; therefore, they cannot receive God. Man, however, has a spirit. Therefore, we can receive God, and we need God. Our spirit is a special organ created by God. The second step in the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s desire and purpose involves man receiving God&rsquo;s life. Man is a vessel to contain the life of God. Therefore, after creating man, God put this vessel in front of His life so that man might receive Him as life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
