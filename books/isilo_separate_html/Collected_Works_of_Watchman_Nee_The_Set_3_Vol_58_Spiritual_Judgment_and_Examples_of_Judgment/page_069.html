C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. In 1937 I saw that I was a sinner and believed in the Lord Jesus. At that time I was very zealous, but later I became cold and backslidden. At a certain point I repented in tears, yet I dared not turn back to the Lord. The brothers exhorted me to go back to the meetings, but I dared not go. While I was praying one day, I cried, "Lord, be merciful." I felt like a prodigal son returning. I began to read the Bible and to pray again. When I came to John 18, I felt like I was Judas, the Lord's betrayer. I loved money and the world. I could not help weeping and repenting. Later one of my sons became ill, and I prayed much. The Lord did not answer my prayer, and he died. I began to wonder why God treated me in this way. After that I began to love my wife and children more than the Lord. I am not worthy to be called the Lord's disciple.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has to learn to exercise his spirit. He has to judge people and things by his spirit. To judge means to discern. Some brothers and sisters first discern with their mind and then with their spirit. I am not saying that we should not use our mind. I am saying that we should first exercise our spirit and then explain things with our mind. If we only exercise our mind, we are just a psychologist. Our spirit should be very available. It should be like an ink pad; others' words should easily leave an impression in us. I like what Brother Yu wrote in the first issue of The Present Testimony. He said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding. When our spirit is calm and available, we will have a clear impression of others' testimonies, and their spirit will make its mark on our spirit. We will be able to sense others' peculiarities. We have to learn to free our spirit from all distractions. This will enable us to know others' spiritual condition. A worker must learn this lesson sooner or later. We are not like the doctors, who use instruments to diagnose their patients. We have our spirit which examines the true condition of every person.</p><p>If we continue to exercise our spirit, our whole being will be held solemnly in check like a thousand horses held silently by reins; it will wait earnestly for a command. When a man comes to us, we will have a strong spirit to discern him. A worker must serve others by exercising his discerning organ&mdash;the spirit. We must be able to exercise our spirit as freely as we exercise our emotion, mind, and will. Brother Yu said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding. The organ for understanding is the mind. This is a unique statement. We should not try to guess what others are doing by our mind. Rather, we should try to get an impression of others with our spirit. A subjective person cannot exercise his spirit, nor can a confused person. The spirit is the organ which receives impressions. After we receive an impression, we interpret it immediately with the mind. This interpretation is like developing an image on photographic film with chemicals. We must stop all noise around us before our ears can pick up singing at a distance. We should exercise our spirit like a man who concentrates himself to pick up sounds from far away. Once there is a little interruption, the ear will not hear clearly. We have to listen with our spirit and receive impressions with our spirit. This is the reason our outer man must be broken and torn down. This is the only way for the inner spirit to remain calm. This is our way. First we exercise our spirit. Then we exercise our mind.</p><p>Our brother's pathway has been relatively straight, and we have much hope for him. But he needs to go through deeper lessons and experience deeper dealings. He needs to receive a severe breaking that comes with the discipline of the Holy Spirit before he can launch into the deep in spiritual matters and before the living water will flow. The Lord will tear you down in a deeper way and follow up with a deeper breaking work in you, in addition to all the fragmentary breakings that He has done. The goal of this breaking is to straighten your pathway. Some people receive a series of dealings from the Lord, but there is a big question as to whether or not these dealings are deep enough.</p><p>As for the time that you were backslidden, perhaps the Lord was dealing with you to turn you from trusting in yourself. There is profit to not sinning, and there is profit even to sinning. Sometimes God breaks down our self-confidence through our failures. When we fail, not only should we stand up again, but also we should learn some lessons through our fall. In the future we will experience more discipline of the Holy Spirit. At any rate, we have to dig the ditch deep before water will flow in. The Lord allows many failures to happen to us for the purpose of breaking our self. There are blessings for falling, and there are blessings for not falling. We should not only learn to stand up when we fall, but also we should learn the proper lessons in the midst of our falling. Romans 8 says that all things work together for good to those who love God. This means that even when we fall, the Holy Spirit can turn it into our good. We have to learn deeper lessons through our falls. We should learn not only to refrain from sin the next time but also to give up our self-confidence and self-righteousness. What we need is not just to learn how to stand after we fall, but also to learn how to fall through our falling. We must daily experience the breaking and tearing down by God before we can experience the building. God has to tear down our self-justification, self-arrogance, and self-trust. All these things will be torn down through our falling. Jeremiah 1:10 says, "To pluck up and to break down,/To destroy and to tear down,/To build up and to plant." May the Lord remove our self-confidence. May He break us day by day so that we can be built up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
