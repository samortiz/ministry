   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basic problem in the matter that John covers in this accusation concerns the understanding of the relationship between the ministry and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the relationship between the ministry or the work and the churches, it has been our practice, from Brother Nee s time up to the present time, that whatever the ministry or the work does is absolutely for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in the building up of the work or the ministry, the purpose and goal are for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The initial purpose and final goal of our ministry or work are absolutely and utterly for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever we do preaching the gospel to save the sinners, feeding the new believers that they may grow, perfecting the saints that they may do the work that the gifted persons can do to build up the Body of Christ, teaching the word and expounding the Bible that the saints may be edified both in the truth and life, training the saints that they may be built up in the Lord s service and work, and even establishing the ministry or the work itself is for the building up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our history has fully proven this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In such a practice as ours, we also stress that all the churches with all the saints should cooperate and be one with the ministry, so that the ministry will be strengthened and be more effective, that the churches with all the saints may benefit more in the ultimate goal for the Lord s interest, that is, to have His organic Body fully built up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Apostle Paul s ministry, such a coordination fellowship and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this Phil 1:5; 4:16, 18; 1 Cor 16:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostle even praised this kind of fellowship as a good work begun by the Lord, and believed that the Lord would complete such a good work until the day of His appearing Phil 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The thought in John s accusation concerning the relationship between the ministry and the churches with all the saints can only weaken the ministry in its work for the church and deprive the churches and the saints of their enjoyment of the benefit of the ministry s work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the cooperation of the churches and the saints, it would be difficult for the ministry to be strong and effective in its work, and without the churches with the saints being one with the ministry, it would be difficult for the Lord s recovery to be prevailing in its spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Dissenting Accusation a Great Effort</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Promotion to Unite the Saints and</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Churches around a Certain</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leader and Organization</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There has been a great effort and promotion to unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of great effort and promotion should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization is to build up a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There has never been such a thing in the Lord s recovery from its beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this does not mean that there is no need for a proper leadership under the Lord that brings the divine revelation to the Lord s people and keeps the Lord s interest from suffering the damage of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the New Testament revelation, in the church the elders take the lead Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8 , and in the ministry Peter took the lead in the Lord s work among the Jews Gal 2:7b , and Paul took the lead in the Lord s work among the Gentiles Gal 2:7a; Rom 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the proper leadership under the Lord, the kingdom of God on the earth today would become an anarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Dissenting Accusation the Pressuring</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>of All the Saints and the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>to Conform to the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>in Full Uniformity</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There has been much pressure with full expectation that all the saints and the churches will conform to the burden of the ministry and be identical with one another in full uniformity of practice, to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely, to have any kind of uniformity is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, to have intentional differences among the churches also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The problem lies in the matter of what vision we are under and what motive we have.</S>
