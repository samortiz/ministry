   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ELDERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE ADMINISTRATORS AMONG GOD S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament God originally ordained for elders, not kings, to be the administrators.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s desire was not that kings would take care of the administration among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the elders need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of us should think that if we become an elder, we become a king.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person becomes a king, he is through; this is not what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is not seeking to have kings; rather, He desires to have elders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among God s people, the elders must represent God to carry out His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s administration cannot be carried out according to the elders view; rather, it must be carried out according to the perpetual law of God, represented by the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament, which are firm and unalterable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, God s administrators must follow His instant, living revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, there is not only the perpetual, written law but also living revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first thing spoken of in the Old Testament in regard to God s administrative arrangement among His people is God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as the kingdom and the people of God came into being, there were elders among them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These elders were not appointed in the same way as kings are appointed in a monarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The principle for the appointment of elders in the church is that elders must be grown-up and older ; hence, it is a matter of life, growth, and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PRIESTS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING THOSE WHO BORE GOD S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God s Old Testament economy God did not arrange for the elders to come directly into God s presence in the Holy of Holies; rather, He wonderfully arranged for there to be another group of people the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the priesthood there was a high priest who, according to God s Old Testament economy, entered into the Holy of Holies once a year to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he wore two kinds of plates.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One kind was the shoulder plates upon which were two onyx stones engraved with the names of the sons of Israel; six names were engraved on the one stone and six names were engraved on the other stone Exo 28:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the high priest should bear God s people on his shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The high priest also wore another kind of plate, the breastplate, which hung upon the high priest s garment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The garments of the high priest were very special.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most important garment was the ephod, which was similar to a vest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bible translators have found it difficult to express this word with an equivalent in their own language; as a result, they simply transliterate the Hebrew word v. 4 . The ephod was a long vest worn over the robe of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ephod was attached to the breastplate, on which were twelve precious stones, each representing a tribe of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved on the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These names contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, according to the Hebrew alphabet, there was still a shortage of four letters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, God instructed Moses to add another object the Thummim, which means perfecters, completers v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this object was added, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The breastplate was similar to a typewriter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An English typewriter contains keys for the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet, and the combination of these letters is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They can be combined to form words, sentences, and even a composition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The breastplate was a spiritual typewriter worn on the breast of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Its being worn on the breast signifies care.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The high priest cared for God s people and carried them with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The high priest needed to put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate v. 30; Lev 8:8 . Some versions indicate that the Urim was a kind of illuminator and that the Thummim was an object upon which were inscribed four letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a problem arose among the children of Israel that could not be solved according to the Ten Commandments, the high priest would bring the breastplate before God to inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the process of inquiring, one of the letters or one of the names of the tribes would suddenly become dark.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This can be likened to the telegraph, in which a message is sent letter by letter until eventually the entire sentence can be read.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The breastplate along with the Urim and the Thummim were the Old Testament telegraph.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the breastplate of the high priest was called the breastplate of judgment Exo 28:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When there was a problem among God s people, the high priest would receive a judgment from God by means of the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
