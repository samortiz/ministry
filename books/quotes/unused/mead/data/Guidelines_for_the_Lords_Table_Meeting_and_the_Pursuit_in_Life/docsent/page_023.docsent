   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE STEPS FOR CHRIST TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FORMED IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some saints are not clear concerning matters such as Christ s being in us and Christ s being in the church; therefore, we would like to have some fellowship focusing on their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Question: How can such a rich Christ become the reality in the church and in the individual believers?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can He be formed in us quickly?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: If a person is walking on the right path while pursuing the Lord, sooner or later he will see that throughout the ages God s work in His plan is primarily to work Christ into man, whether in creation or redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not say that no one has seen this matter in the last two thousand years, but we can say that very few have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man s natural concept and natural thought is his greatest problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christians must have the realization that man s natural concept is a problem that hinders Christ from living in them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We each have our natural concept and natural view.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After salvation, some saints think that it is good to never lose their temper, and others focus on the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Christ can be hindered from living in one who regards the way of the church above everything else, because his firm belief in the way of the church may not be the result of revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps there is an affinity to the way of the church in his background, environment, and state of mind; thus, it is easy for him to comprehend and to accept the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, his understanding and acceptance of the way of the church is something natural and human.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who is saved should have a heart for the Lord, but the fact is that many do not have such a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to speak concerning the following matter with one who does not have a heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord desires man to live by Him and let Him live in man so that man may live out His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord has no way in one who does not have a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the Lord also has a problem with those who have a heart for Him; this problem is their natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We either do not love the Lord, or once we love the Lord, we think we should be zealous, humble, work diligently, preach the gospel for the Lord, fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apparently these are good concepts, but in those who love the Lord, these concepts are the biggest enemies of Christ and hinder Him the most.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, strictly speaking, even our eager expectation to live out the riches of Christ can possibly be according to human concept and therefore be the biggest enemy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us consider, can we actually live out Christ by our eagerness?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Can we live out Christ merely because we want to do so?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that with many of us, our eyes have not been opened to see that wanting to live out Christ is a human concept, a human work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s wanting to live out Christ is actually an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever man wants to be and do originates from man himself, and this hinders Christ from being lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There must be a day when God shows us that we have nothing, that we are good for nothing, and that we are devoid of any merit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, we must see that God s intention is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we need to see that all of our concepts are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regardless of how good our concepts are, they frustrate Christ from being lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we need to see that God s intention is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a revelation and a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to ask God to have mercy on us that we may have such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Merely listening to man s preaching is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once a person sees the vision, no matter who he is, he will prostrate himself before the Lord and stop all his speaking; he will no longer say that he will be good, zealous, humble, gentle, and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may be eager and try to study how to live out Christ, but we will be unable to make it in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Question: What if we genuinely want to let Him live?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Answer: This is a mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one has a vision, letting works, but if one is without a vision, letting does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The shining upon Paul on the way to Damascus is a typical case Acts 9:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before receiving the light, Paul was full of natural concepts in his service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He went to Damascus for the purpose of arresting Christians because he was exceedingly zealous for God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not have the thought, the intention, to sin or oppose God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, he loved God and followed the footsteps of his forefathers to serve God in a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, after the shining of the light on the way to Damascus, his whole being was stopped, and he became blind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that he no longer had his own view and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we want to let Christ live in us, we must have a vision and a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be a day when the Spirit of God shows us that the greatest hindrance to Christ s being lived out of us is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our concept represents our self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to see this in order for us to stop our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean that we do not need to pursue the Lord and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must still have a heart for the Lord and pursue to go on with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in our pursuit of Him, we must stop ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have the revelation of the Holy Spirit and truly stop our doing, allowing Him to work in us and to give us vision and revelation, we will see a strong twofold revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a revelation, on the one hand, will cause us to love the Lord even more fervently and, on the other hand, will cause us to stop our entire being, to stop our self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all love the Lord, we at least love Him a little, but we may have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, whenever we draw near to the Lord, we have the hope that our temper will be improved, and we therefore ask the Lord to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we need the Lord to open our eyes to see that even such a little hope is a natural concept that can be a hindrance to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to stop ourselves, but this is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we see the light and receive revelation, we must stop ourselves; then we must give ourselves, consecrate ourselves, to Christ, not to do something for Him but to consent to His living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He cannot live in us before He has obtained our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must agree with Him and give ourselves completely to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We often have the thought of doing something for the Lord when consecrating ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we give ourselves to the Lord, we frequently have a desire and make the decision to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Very few consecrated ones do not have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fact, nearly every consecrated one has an intention of doing something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is right for us to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but we need to drop our desire to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a natural concept, a human concept, to want to do something for the Lord, and it is this concept, this very thought, that frustrates Christ from being lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our consecration we do not see that Christ is all and that He wants to live in us to be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, we think that Christ needs our service and our work and that we are somewhat useful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a thought becomes a hindrance to the carrying out of God s eternal plan in us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although we have a heart for the Lord, when we have such a thought, we do not let Him have all the room in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we must see that we are a problem to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we hand ourselves over to Christ without bringing along our own terms, desires, and intentions, He will be able to do what He desires in us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we hand ourselves over to Christ, we should not hope that He will help us control our temper and make us gentle, nor should we pray that He will help us become useful in His hand and enable us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should merely give ourselves to Him to be of the same mind with Him and to walk with Him, not having our own hope, view, and purpose but simply allowing Him to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need strong light from the Lord to show us that the way to enter into God s life depends upon our seeing these two points.</S>
