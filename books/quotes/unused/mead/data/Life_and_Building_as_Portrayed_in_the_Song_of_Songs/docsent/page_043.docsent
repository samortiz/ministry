   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN PRODUCING THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:2-6, 8, 16; 6:1-6; Phil 3:10; Col 1:24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Song of Songs is really a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Again we must say that our intention is not merely to understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we must see are all the turning points in life that we may grow up for God's eternal purpose, the corporate building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our main emphasis in all these messages is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life is for building, and building issues out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see the turns in life to have the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The maturity in life will then produce the building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Though we have no intention to merely understand this book, yet we still need to be familiar with all the terms, expressions, illustrations, and figures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a poetic writing, and in such a writing these figures are important.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not for the mere knowledge of the Bible, but we are for knowing all the turns in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, I feel we need a review of all the figures we have covered thus far.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SEEKING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This book shows us that the spiritual growth in life begins with seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our seeking is always the result of our being attracted and drawn by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever the Lord shows Himself to us, spontaneously we will be drawn to seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seeking in this book is in a way of love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are attracted by the Lord, we start to seek Him by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the seeking, there is the finding, which brings us into the real fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The seeking brings the finding, and the finding brings the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first chapter of this book, the seeking one was brought into the inner chamber of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was even sitting at the King's table.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates an intimate and intensified fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by fellowship with the Lord that we begin to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first step in our experience is not to enjoy the Lord directly, but to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here the seeking one began to appreciate the Lord as a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of henna flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These were all appreciations of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She truly appreciated His sweetness, His fairness, and His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the last verse of chapter one, she entered into a further and deeper fellowship with the Lord: "The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cedar signifies resurrection, and the rafters of fir signify the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this she came into a closer fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TRANSFORMATION BEGINS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By all these appreciations of the Lord she entered into the first step of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was likened by the Lord to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She still had her natural strength, and she was carrying something worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But gradually her eyes were changed to doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, her concept was radically changed by more appreciation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we appreciate the Lord's sweetness and fairness, the more our mind will be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will lose the view of our natural birth and begin to have the insight of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the closer and deeper fellowship with the Lord mentioned in the last verse of chapter one, she became a lily trusting only in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A horse is full of its own strength, but a lily has no strength in which to trust.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The natural strength was lost; she realized that to go on with the Lord she must drop all her natural power to do things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She began to put her trust in God; this is the living of the lily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She became even as one of the little lilies growing in the field, trusting in God's care.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She did not live by her own labor and toil, but by trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is real transformation.</S>
