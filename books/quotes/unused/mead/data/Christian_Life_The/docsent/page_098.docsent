   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN LIVING AND WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNDER THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST 3 Scripture Reading: John 3:5; Gal 2:20a; 1 Cor 15:36; Matt 16:24-26; Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6; 8:13b; 2 Cor 4:10, 16; Phil 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In message twelve we saw that we were regenerated crucified, born crucified John 3:5; Gal 2:20a , and that now we are dying to live 1 Cor 15:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In message thirteen we saw that we need to bear the cross of Christ as our cross in dealing with our soul-life, our self Matt 16:24-26 , and that we need to crucify our flesh with its passions and lusts in dealing with our body of sin Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6; 8:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to see something further concerning our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>UNDER THE KILLING OF CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THAT HIS LIFE MAY BE MANIFESTED IN OUR BODY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Christian life we are under the killing of Christ's death, and this has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The purpose is that His life may be manifested in our body in the renewing of the inner man 2 Cor 4:10, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 4 is concerning the renewing of our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As regenerated believers, we are complicated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were born in the physical realm, and then we were regenerated in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have had two births, so we are a "double person."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By our natural birth we are an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though a person is only nineteen years old, he is still an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through regeneration, through the second birth, we all became a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now outwardly we are old, but inwardly we are new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, God is not satisfied to leave us in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants our old man to be renewed by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Transformation transfers us from one form, the form of the old man, to another form, the form of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word transform means to be transferred to another form.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord accomplishes this by the killing of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In message twelve we pointed out that we were born crucified, regenerated crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, from the day of our regeneration, we have been a dying person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In one sense, we are living, but in another sense, we are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are dying to live 1 Cor 15:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is no death, there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not die, we cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul said we are "always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Putting to death here means killing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The death of Christ kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His death is the killing capacity within us.</S>
