	 <h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE ELDERSHIP</h2>
<p>A short time later, the system of the elders&rsquo; administration of the church was recovered. Some believers saw in the Bible that the older and more mature ones among them should administrate the church; they spontaneously formed the Presbyterian Church. This church was also independent of earthly governments.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF A HOLY LIVING</h2>
<p>The next recovery was of a holy living; this recovery was brought in by the Wesleys and their followers. The Wesley brothers, John and Charles, were excellent students at Oxford University in England. John Wesley was good at preaching sermons, and Charles Wesley was good at writing hymns. They both preached that people should live a holy life. Thus, they made many rules for people to follow regarding how to live a holy life. Some of their rules were according to the truth, but they also made some errors.</p>
<p>At that time the winds of revolution were sweeping through Europe, and they could have swept through England as well. Because of the tremendous influence of the Wesleys and their followers, however, many English people were changed, and reforms were made in English society. Thus, there was no need for such a revolution; a bloodless revolution occurred that saved England from the misfortune of much bloodshed.</p>
<p>John Wesley&rsquo;s influence was very great. His group emphasized holy living; by <em>holy living</em> they meant &ldquo;sinless living.&rdquo; They used Romans 6:22 to say that the result of sanctification is sinlessness. They said that anything unholy is a defilement. Although they did not understand the true meaning of holiness, they still exercised to be holy and to have a holy living. However, because they did not really understand what holiness is, they expounded what the Bible says concerning holiness in a manner that seems correct but is actually incorrect. Nevertheless, many people had a genuine change in their behavior through the recovery of the teaching of a holy living. Prior to this recovery, even the people in Protestantism were corrupted, not to mention those in Catholicism; although the Protestants spoke much about justification by faith, their living was not proper, and they were defeated.</p>
<p>God raised up John Wesley to do the work of recovery in England, but he was very much influenced by the Moravians and received much help from them in the matter of teachings. Thus, the word preached by John Wesley mainly came from the Moravian Brethren.</p>
<p>Later, the teachings of Andrew Murray were primarily based upon the works of William Law. William Law brought great change to the mystics. At William Law&rsquo;s time, the teachings of the mystics were not able to spread, but after his changes, their teachings became more practical. Many of Andrew Murray&rsquo;s teachings were derived from the writings of William Law and therefore from the mystics. John Wesley could not escape from the influence of the mystics; thus, many aspects of his doctrine of holiness contain a mystical viewpoint.</p>
<p>I have read books by the mystics, which teach that sanctification is equivalent to regeneration; thus, if a person is not sanctified, it means that he is not regenerated. Experientially, this is correct, but the truth is not sufficiently accurate. It is not absolutely wrong to state that regeneration is equivalent to sanctification, but there are some problems with such a statement. If sanctification is regeneration, then have those believers who live a defeated life been regenerated or not? This question is problematic.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan recovery was very strong. It was a recovery calling people to live a sin-overcoming life and causing many to pursue a holy living. George Whitefield was the most famous contemporary of the Wesleys, and he was also a very capable person. The Wesleys and Whitefield did not preach the gospel to unbelievers; rather, they preached the gospel to Christians. They said that if a person was not regenerated, he would not be sanctified; this caused people to make a great turn and have a change in their living. People had been living messy lives, but at that time, they had a change in their living. We should not question whether this was from the human element or the divine element; we do not need to analyze it. The main thing is that at the time of the Wesleys, many people had a turn. This recovery caused the boundary line of white linen hangings around the tabernacle to be drawn more clearly.</p>
