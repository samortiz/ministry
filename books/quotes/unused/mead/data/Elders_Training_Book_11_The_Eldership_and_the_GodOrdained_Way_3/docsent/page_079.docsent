   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul says in Ephesians 4:3 that we should keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences due to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In so doing, He has made peace for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This peace should bind all believers together, thus becoming the uniting bond.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There should never be any kind of fighting within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to keep the oneness by remaining in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 4:2 says that we need to keep the oneness with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and meekness is not to fight for oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have these two virtues in dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Longsuffering is to endure mistreatment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should have this virtue in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By these virtues we bear one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to bear me, and I have to bear you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what it means to walk worthily of the Lord's calling Eph 4:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Division Annulling the Body and the Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any division annuls the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Body is annulled, the oneness is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the recovery is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to keeping the oneness of the Body, we need to maintain a good order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the highest entity in the universe with the top standard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we need to have a beautiful, pleasant order among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is a problem among us, we have to take care of it in a biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a problem arose concerning circumcision, Paul and the brothers with him took care of it in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 15 speaks of their going to see the brothers in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They came together in a proper way to give testimonies and to seek the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the decision was made through Peter by James.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through Peter's testimony and by James's word, a conclusion was reached.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They said that this conclusion seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to them v. 28 . This shows that the conclusion reached was by them and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the right way to solve a problem in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to come together properly, pray, study the Word, and make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By taking care of Christ and by taking care of His Body, we will avoid division, keep the oneness, and maintain a good order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I feel I must say this because another turmoil may suddenly rise up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not repeat anything of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us come together with an open spirit to pray together, get into the Word, and check our situation with the Word in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we can get a divine answer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the right way.</S>
