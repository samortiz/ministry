   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERSECUTION BY POLITICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter fourteen we are told that Herod the king killed John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the report of this was brought to the Lord, He simply retreated into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Remember that this is a book of the revelation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the Lord Jesus repudiated everything natural and made the kingdom a mystery, the religious people rejected Him and the kingdom, and the political people persecuted and killed those who accepted the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, He went into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you had lived at that time and had wanted to follow Him, you would have had to go to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter thirteen through the first part of chapter seventeen is a section showing us the period of time from the rejection of the Lord Jesus and His kingdom until the full coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During this period between His rejection and the full manifestation of the kingdom, the kingdom people must follow Him by leaving religion and politics and going into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are still living in this period today, for it began at the time of Matthew 13 and will continue until the full manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the full coming of the kingdom, there will be the real and full transfiguration of all the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountaintop in Matthew 17 was a miniature of the full coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was the coming of the kingdom on a small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The full coming of the kingdom will occur in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The section of Matthew which we are presently considering goes from chapter thirteen until the full coming of the kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During this period the kingdom people must follow the Lord Jesus by going into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The background for this move into the wilderness was His rejection by religion and His persecution by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we mean business with the Lord for the kingdom, we will certainly be rejected by religion and persecuted by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not expect anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There can be no friendship from religion and no kindness from politics.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be the kingdom people means that we will undergo opposition from religion and persecution from politics.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, the synagogues rejected Christ, and King Herod killed John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus heard of this, He did not fight or say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He and His disciples retreated into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that the kingdom people are a people out of this world, out of religion, and out of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a sense, until the kingdom comes in full, we are in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In reality we are the kingdom people and we are in the kingdom, but outwardly speaking we are living in the wilderness.</S>
