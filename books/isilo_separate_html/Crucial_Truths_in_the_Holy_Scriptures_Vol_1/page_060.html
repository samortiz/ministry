<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Save His people from their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:21).</p>
<p>The first result of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is deliverance from sin. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation saves us from our sins. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is delivered from the punishment and authority of sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Redeemed us out of the curse of the law&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation satisfied the requirements of the law and redeemed us out of the curse of the law. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us from the curse of the law. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is no longer under the curse of the law</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Delivers us from the wrath which is coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation solves the problems of our sin and the punishment related to our sins. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us from God&rsquo;s coming wrath. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation does not need to fear God&rsquo;s coming wrath because the Lord on the cross received the punishment of God&rsquo;s wrath in our place and drank the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath for us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Delivered us out of the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us out of the authority of darkness. The authority of darkness is Satan and his kingdom. Through His death on the cross, the Lord defeated Satan and his kingdom. Satan and his kingdom have no ground in us. We have been delivered from Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and his domination.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, the world was judged through His death on the cross. Furthermore, when we were baptized into the Lord&rsquo;s death, being buried together with Him, we were also saved from the world. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation rescues us out of the present evil age.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we escape judgment and death because He bore our sins on the cross, He was judged by God, and He fully tasted death on our behalf. We are saved, and we will not be judged and condemned again. We have already passed out of death into life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Proof</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:77; see also 1 John 5:13; 3:14; Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>We can know that we are eternally saved now. We know we are saved because our sins are forgiven, our conscience is at peace, the burden of our sin has fallen away, and our spirit is released. The Word of God, the Bible, also tells us that we have the Lord&rsquo;s life and that we are saved when we believe. The change in our life and living also proves that we are saved. The Holy Spirit is in our spirit, and He testifies that we are the children of God. These things give us the assurance to know that we are saved. (We will study the details of this point in chapter 15.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Testimony</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Baptism</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:21).</p>
<p>A person who is saved by faith should not only be assured inwardly of his salvation but also testify outwardly of his salvation. As soon as one is saved, his first testimony should be baptism. Baptism is the way to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation; it is also a testimony that one has obtained the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. When one is baptized, he receives the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation and testifies that he has obtained the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. He testifies that his sins were washed away by the Lord, that he is joined to the Lord, and that he has died together with the Lord. Baptism is a silent testimony that comes out of a clear conscience. Although this is before God, it is also before others. Under normal conditions, when we see someone being baptized, we know he is saved.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
