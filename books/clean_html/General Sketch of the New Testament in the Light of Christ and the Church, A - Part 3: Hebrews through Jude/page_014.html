<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>ENTERING THE VEIL AND GOING OUTSIDE THE CAMP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:1-3; 13:10-13; Exo. 33:7</h1><p>The book of Hebrews may be divided into two main sections. Chapters one through ten may be considered the first major section, dealing with certain truths. Chapters eleven through thirteen are the second main section, dealing with the way of faith. In the first section there are four subsections. The first tells us that Christ is superior to the angels, the second that Christ is superior to Moses, the third that Christ is superior to Aaron, and the fourth that Christ’s new covenant is superior to the old. Christ is superior to everything in Judaism.<p>The second section of Hebrews deals with the way to follow the Lord. Chapter eleven speaks concerning the witnesses of faith. Then, as we have seen, each section of Hebrews contains an exhortation and a warning, which in the last section of this book is the whole of chapter twelve.<h2 class=head1>FOLLOWING JESUS ON THE PATHWAY OF FAITH</h2><p>After dealing with the matters of the truth in a full way, the writer goes on to tell us that we have to follow Jesus on the pathway of faith. The pathway of faith is a narrow way, the way of the cross. It is the narrow way of suffering and the way of loss. Therefore, we must walk this way by faith. All the patriarchs and prophets in the ancient time are witnesses of this way. They are a cloud of witnesses surrounding us and testifying to us of the pathway of faith.<p>Hebrews 12:1-3 says, “Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.” Christ is the unique Author and Perfecter of our faith. Therefore, for this faith by which we walk the narrow way, we need to look away unto Jesus. This living faith is not something originating from us, but it is from Him. We must look away from ourselves, from all our circumstances, surroundings, environment, and all things, unto Him and take Him as the Author and Perfecter of our faith. In ourselves we do not have the faith by which we can walk the narrow way of the cross, but we can look away from all things other than Christ unto Him. Then He will be the Author and Perfecter of this faith. If we look away unto Him, we will have His living faith for us to walk the narrow way of the cross. This is the main content of chapters eleven and twelve.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING CHRIST WITHIN THE VEIL</h2><p>Hebrews 13:10 says, “We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.” This verse tells us that there is a unique altar in the universe. On this altar we have an offering to eat and enjoy. The priests of Judaism have no right to eat from this altar, but we the believers do. This altar is the very cross of Christ, and on this altar the offering we enjoy is Christ Himself.<p>Verse 11 says, “For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.” The blood of the offering was brought into the sanctuary, but the bodies of the offerings were burned outside the camp. This signifies that we enjoy Christ as our offering in two aspects, an aspect in the heavens and an aspect on the earth. First, the blood of Christ was brought into the heavenly sanctuary to be effective for us there. This is a matter of the priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec. By and through Christ’s redeeming blood, which was shed on the cross and brought into the heavenly sanctuary, the heavens were opened to us and we were brought into the heavenlies, that is, into our spirit, to contact and enjoy the heavenly things. This is the enjoyment of the heavenly Christ in the heavenly Holy of Holies.
