<h1 class="title">PROPHECIES AND TYPES OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:10-12, 18-20; Rev. 13:8; Rom. 1:2; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Luke 24:44-46; Heb. 8:5; 10:1; Col. 2:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to work His life into man so that man may have the sonship and be conformed to the image of the Son of God, making His Son the Firstborn among many brothers (Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:29). Both God&rsquo;s eternal plan and His creation in time are for the purpose of gaining man and working His life into man to conform man to the image of His Son to become His many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF THE FALL OF MAN</h2>
<p>After man was created, however, Satan seduced man to sin, and before God could work His life into man, he fell. Satan injected his defiling, sinful, and evil life into man. Hence, the clean and pure man whom God had created for His plan was defiled and mixed with sin and death. This posed a problem for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s plan. Once man had sinned and was defiled by sin and death, the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory could not permit man to contact God&rsquo;s life (Gen. 3:24). In order to accomplish His eternal purpose of creating man so that man would receive His life, God&rsquo;s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory had to be satisfied by taking away man&rsquo;s sin and dealing with the element of death.</p>
<p>God created man so that man would have His life and be the many brothers of His Son, but He also wanted man to deal with His enemy, Satan. Consequently, Satan deceived man in order to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; him from God. Before the fall of man, Satan and his angels were in rebellion against God. With the fall, man joined Satan in his rebellion against God. Even though man fell and was rebellious, God did not destroy him, because He wants to fulfill His eternal purpose with man. In order for God to fulfill His eternal purpose with man, He needs to deliver man from Satan&rsquo;s hand and destroy Satan. Negatively, He has to deal with the problems caused by Satan by putting away sin, dealing with death, and destroying Satan. Positively, He desires that man would have His life and be conformed to the image of His Son in order to be His many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION IN GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>In His eternal plan God not only created all things and man in order to accomplish His eternal purpose, but according to His foreknowledge that man would fall, He also planned for man&rsquo;s redemption after the fall. Redemption in God&rsquo;s plan was not something in His consideration only after the fall. God&rsquo;s plan was predetermined by Him in eternity past, and God prepared Christ, the Accomplisher of His redemption &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20). In His eternal plan God determined that Christ would accomplish redemption after man&rsquo;s fall; thus, Christ was slain &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<p>Just as God&rsquo;s creation is according to His plan, God&rsquo;s redemption is according to His plan. In God&rsquo;s plan there are both creation and redemption. Creation alone cannot accomplish His plan; there is a need for redemption in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. In God&rsquo;s plan creation is for redemption. God created all things and planned for redemption. Creation is only the beginning of God&rsquo;s procedure to accomplish His plan; redemption is the completion of this procedure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHECIES OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Redemption was preplanned, predetermined, by God. Even before redemption was accomplished, God clearly spoke of various aspects of redemption through many prophecies in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3, after man sinned, fell, and was &ldquo;stolen away&rdquo; by Satan, God came in to curse Satan and to speak of His promise of the seed of the woman, saying, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord promised that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on the head; that is, a seed would come and deal with the seducing, incriminating, and corrupting serpent. Whereas Satan would bruise the seed of the woman on the heel, the seed of the woman would put the seducing, incriminating, and corrupting Satan to death. Although Satan would afflict the seed of the woman, Satan&rsquo;s bruising could not destroy him, because the bruising would merely be to his heel. The seed of the woman, however, would bruise Satan fatally on the head.</p>
<p>When Eve gave birth to Cain, she thought Cain was the seed that God had promised (4:1). Although Cain was born of Eve, a woman, he was not the seed of a woman but the seed of a man, Adam. The genealogies in the Bible always present offspring as being the seed of a man, not of a woman. Thus, everyone who is born of a father in the flesh cannot be considered to be the seed of a woman.</p>
<p>The New Testament fulfillment of this seed is the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:23). Among all mankind, only He was born of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He came to the earth to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). Through death He destroyed him who had the might of death, that is, the devil (Heb. 2:14). Hence, when Satan &ldquo;stole&rdquo; man away, God&rsquo;s promise of a seed was a promise that Christ would come to be born of a woman so that He might destroy Satan.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
