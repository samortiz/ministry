   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN SANCTIFICATION IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we come to the section on glorification, I have a burden to give an additional message on the matter of sanctification in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>HOLINESS, AND GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was an excellent writer and his thought was very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Romans Paul firstly covers the subject of condemnation and then proceeds to cover justification, sanctification, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As God deals with us, He always cares for three of His divine attributes His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is righteous, God is holy, and God is a God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Righteousness is related to God s acts, to His ways, actions, and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything God does is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Holiness is God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Holiness is not a matter of action, but of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the nature of a table is wood and the nature of a book is paper, so the nature of God is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s acts are righteous and His nature is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is glory?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Glory is God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God is expressed, that is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in righteousness we see God s ways, in holiness we see God s nature, and in glory we see God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three of the sections in Romans justification, sanctification, and glorification were composed according to these three attributes of God: justification according to God s righteousness, sanctification according to God s holiness, and glorification according to God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first stage of God s salvation we participate in the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is justification in which we gain God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the second stage we are in the process of sanctification, a process in which God works His divine nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s righteousness is reckoned to us in justification, but it is not wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in God s sanctification His holiness is wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we have obtained and participated in God s righteousness outwardly, God s holiness needs to be wrought into us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second stage of God s salvation is that He works His holy nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to accomplish this God has been processed into the available Spirit of life 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before being processed He was not available to perform this subjective work of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before He was processed He was able to create the world, but He was unable to enter into His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although He could do many things outside of us, He could not come into us until He had passed through the complete process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since being processed, He has become and still is the available Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, like the air for breathing John 20:22 , it is so easy for Him to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the available Spirit of life, God has come into our spirit, making it life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since Christ, the life-giving Spirit, is in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has made our spirit life by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, as the Spirit of life in our spirit, He is spreading Himself from our spirit into our soul into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, He will even expand into our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a way God saturates us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This saturation is called sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through this saturation God works Himself with His holy nature into our entire being, into our spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, our whole being will be fully permeated, sanctified, with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are presently undergoing this process of sanctification, the second stage of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the next stage we will be raptured and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That will be the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Glorification means to transfigure our vile body into a glorious body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time we will be completely and absolutely brought into God Himself as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we will be fully glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first stage of God s salvation, justification, takes care of our spirit; the second stage, sanctification, mainly deals with our soul, with a slight amount of saturation in our body; and the third stage, glorification, concerns our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Romans 8:10 Paul says that if Christ is in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness, meaning that in God s justification we have gained righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through this righteousness our spirit has been made alive and actually becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, there is not yet the divine life in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we need to cooperate with the indwelling Christ by setting our mind upon the spirit, enabling the Spirit of life to saturate our mind with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then our mind will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we continue to cooperate, this saturating and spreading One will spread Himself from our spirit even into our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we only need wait for the time when our body will be brought into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we can understand why Paul wrote Romans in the order that he did, with justification first, followed by sanctification and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These three sections cover the three stages of complete salvation and correspond to the three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In justification our spirit is made alive, in sanctification our soul is made life, and in glorification even our body will be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When this process is completed, we will not only be justified and sanctified, but also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Presently we are in the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, I am burdened to give this message on sanctification in life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although you may never have heard the term sanctification in life, it is nevertheless a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From the beginning of the book of Romans through 8:13 two main things are covered, justification and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In justification God gives us His righteousness, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has made Christ righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, this is objective, for righteousness is Christ as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, righteousness is objective, like a roof that covers us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, in the second stage, sanctification, God is working Christ into us to make Him our sanctification subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our whole being will be permeated with the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is sanctification in life.</S>
