After I had given some messages concerning taking Christ as our person, a sister testified that in the past she had difficulty going to sleep at night. She used to pray earnestly, asking the Lord to help her go to sleep. But since she understood the real meaning of taking Christ as her person, she began to change her way of prayer. She prayed in a simple way, saying, "Lord, do You want to sleep or not? If You want to sleep, then I sleep. If You don't want to sleep, then I don't sleep." She told us that after she prayed this way, she immediately went to sleep. This is a good example of what it means to take Christ as your person.</P><P>Recently, I checked with one of the young students. I said, "Brother So-and-so, after tonight's meeting, you are going to take a bus. How would you pray?" He said, "I will pray, 'Lord, which bus should I take?'" I told him that his prayer was a religious prayer and that it was wrong to pray that way. Then I told him, "When you go out of the meeting hall, you need to have a little talk with the Lord, saying, 'Lord, which bus are You going to take? If You take bus number one, I will take that too. If You take bus number two, I will also take the same bus.'" It is so simple to take Christ as our person.</P><P>Do not try to be holy, spiritual, or victorious. Forget about all these things. Always take Christ as your person. Always tell Him and tell the whole universe that now you are not living by yourself. You are living by Christ not only as your life but also as your person. It is so simple. I encourage all of you, the younger ones as well as the older ones, to try it. We need to be simplified. We have become complicated by Christian teachings. We were taught that we should be holy, but we need to forget about this. Instead, be so simple and go to the Lord. Just tell Him, "O Lord, You are not only my life but also my person. I am good and qualified for taking You as my person."</P><P>Wherever you are, whatever you do, and whatever you say, simply take Christ as your person. Suppose tomorrow you plan to go to the beach. You have to put this into practice and ask, "Lord, will You go to the beach tomorrow? Lord, if You go, I will go. If You do not go, neither will I. You are my person." It is so simple. If we all take Christ as our person, spontaneously we will express God, and we will also subdue the enemy. We will conquer all the enemies and have a conquering life, instead of a conquered life.</P><P>Just be simple. Learn to practice taking Christ as your person in all the things in your daily walk. In everything learn to take Christ as your person. Do not take this as a doctrine. Take this word and put it into practice in your daily living. Then you will see how prevailing it is. If you take Christ as your person, you will spontaneously express God and represent God. All day long the enemy will be under your feet. You will have a subduing life instead of a subdued life. This means you will be victorious.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
