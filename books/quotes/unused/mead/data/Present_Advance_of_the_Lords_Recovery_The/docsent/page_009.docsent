   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we are living an overcoming life, we abide, remain, stay, in the fellowship with the Lord 1 John 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as an appliance stays in the electricity, it works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once it is cut off from the electricity, its function stops.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to remain in the divine electricity, the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we rise up early in the morning to have a new revival, that brings us again into the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the whole day, we need to keep ourselves in this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>SPEAKING CHRIST AND FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN ALL KINDS OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are abiding in fellowship with the Lord, we will speak Christ and function in all kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will speak Christ to all people at all times in season and out of season 2 Tim 4:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To the sinners we will preach Christ as the Savior, as the gospel, and to the saved ones we will minister Christ as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All day long we have to practice speaking Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our speaking Christ is a strong sign that we are persons in the present advance of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need to function in all kinds of meetings by praying and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In any kind of meeting we have to learn to pray and learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we have fellowshipped in this chapter is the life that is needed for us to take the way of the present recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s present recovery needs persons living such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we practice the points in this chapter, we will be saved from ourselves, our flesh, and our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of life will not allow us to be slothful with the Lord, to be idle in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a life will save us from many abnormal things, and we will be altogether normal in every way and in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not revived persons, it is difficult to go out to save sinners by contacting them where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not touch the saints first concerning preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to touch them first concerning having a revived life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to help the saints to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to preach or promote door-knocking in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to do something to minister Christ to the saints that they may be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then they will begin to live an overcoming life to such an extent that we may not need to tell them to go to visit people in their homes with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will do it spontaneously because they will have a desire to preach Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their motive for preaching the gospel will not be our teaching but it will be Christ abiding in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ abiding in them will be the motive for them to get sinners saved, to have home meetings, and to have group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need such a revived life for the Lord s present recovery.</S>
