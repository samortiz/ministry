LOVING THE LORD</h2><p>In this lesson we want to fellowship about having a normal daily Christian life that is in spirit and expresses Christ. The first and most important thing in a normal Christian life is loving the Lord. [If we love the Lord, we surely will be filled with Him. Whatever fills us within will come out of us. The overflow comes from the infilling. When we love the Lord, He will fill us.] Revelation chapters two and three contain seven epistles to seven churches in Asia. The first item of degradation was the loss of the first love by the Church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:4). They did many good works, but losing their first love could cause them to lose the church status if they would not repent (Rev. 2:5). Due to the loss of their first love, the churches became lukewarm, and the Lord wanted to vomit them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:14-16). Therefore, the first thing we must do is to repent by praying, “O Lord, forgive me for not loving you first, for not loving you supremely, and for not loving you hotly. Lord, I still love so many things in the world. I even love myself. O Lord, forgive me, cleanse me with Your precious blood. Lord, I want to declare to You and to the whole universe that I love You now. I love You more than anything else in the world. I do not love myself. I love only You. Fill me with your Spirit. Amen!’’ If you would pray this way, you will start to love the Lord again. Your first love will be restored and you will be filled with His Spirit.
