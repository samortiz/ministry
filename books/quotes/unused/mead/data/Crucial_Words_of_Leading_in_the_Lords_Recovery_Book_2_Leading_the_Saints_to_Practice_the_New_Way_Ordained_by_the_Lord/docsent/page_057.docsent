   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New Testament Ministers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Being Ruled by Man Directly</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Sent by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps some may say that Paul led a group of co-workers and that everything was under his direction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although this is not altogether wrong, if we consider carefully the record in the Bible, we cannot find a definite verse that indicates that Paul was directing his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did write to Timothy, saying, Be diligent to come to me quickly;...the cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments 2 Tim 4:9, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians Paul severely rebuked the Corinthian believers, but when he wrote the book of 2 Corinthians, he was apprehensive and sorrowful within, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Titus so that he would know the condition of the Corinthian believers 2 Cor 2:13; 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of 1 Corinthians, Paul indicated that he had hoped that Apollos would go to comfort the Corinthian believers, but Apollos was not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regarding this Paul said, Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a strong proof that every co-worker has the liberty in the Holy Spirit in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to our natural concept, we may think that Paul took the lead in the work in the same way that the pope does today; however, this understanding is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the pope were to say to a bishop under him, Go and pay a visit to Corinth, I doubt that any bishop would be like Apollos and dare say to the pope, It is not at all my desire to go now; I will go later when it is convenient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that Paul did not direct the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Catholic Church the Virgin Mary, the so-called mother of God, is considered to be without the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Beginning in the Middle Ages, a great controversy began concerning whether or not Mary was without original sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally in 1854, Pope Pius IX broke the deadlock and made it church dogma that Mary was without original sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From then on, all Catholics and Catholic theologians must say that the Virgin Mary was without the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even Madame Guyon, author of Sweet Smelling Myrrh, obeyed the pope to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the pope put her into prison, she still obeyed him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Relying on the Teaching of the Apostles The Apostles Teaching Not Allowing Man</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>to Teach Things That Are Different</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>from God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The example concerning Paul and Apollos shows that Paul was not the directing one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, a matter was not settled simply because Paul said something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In sending co-workers to particular places, Paul did not insist; rather, he gave the brothers absolute freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the matter of speaking the truth, however, he was unyielding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy, Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the context, these different things refer to the law, Old Testament genealogies v. 4 , and profane and old-womanish myths 4:7 . According to Paul s thought, we should speak only God s economy, which is in faith; that is, we should speak only the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we draw the conclusion that it was the apostles teaching that took the lead in the New Testament, not Paul as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles teaching, the truth, the faith, the teaching of God s economy took the lead in the New Testament ministry.</S>
