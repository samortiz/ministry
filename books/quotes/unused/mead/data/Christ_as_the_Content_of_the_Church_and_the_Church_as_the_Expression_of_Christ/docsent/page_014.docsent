   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST AS GRACE AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the reality and content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truthfulness, or truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I was taught that truth means sincerity, so we have to worship God in spirit and in sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the more one reads the Gospel of John, the more he realizes that this is not the right meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way, the truth reality , and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say that the Lord is the way, the sincerity, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not fit the concept of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, I was taught that truth means the proper doctrines or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some Christian teachers say that John 4:24 means that we have to worship God in the spirit and according to the proper doctrines or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not a proper interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord surely did not mean that He is the way, the doctrine, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real meaning of the word truth in John is not according to our natural or religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 1 says that the Word who was God became flesh, and this One was full of grace and truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 16 says, "For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we receive of the fullness of Christ, we have grace upon grace to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 17 and 18 say, "For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality truth came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace and truth are the items of Christ's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His fullness is the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that God is, is embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace and truth are in contrast to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that the law is versus grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, if we are to understand the meaning of grace and truth, we have to know the meaning of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John tells us that the law was given by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He does not say that the law came by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that you can receive the law without receiving Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that if you are going to receive grace and truth, you have to receive this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Darby's New Translation of John 1:17 says, "Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Grace and truth subsist through Christ, so when you receive Him, you receive grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CHRIST AS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law never gives you something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, it always demands something of you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Grace, on the other hand, never demands but always gives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ came to give and to impart, not to demand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The law tells us to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But grace came to us through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this One comes into us, He imparts to us the honoring of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ does not demand that we honor our parents; instead, He supplies us with what He is to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The law tells us to love our neighbor as ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ comes to impart love into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He supplies us with love to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, Christ as grace never demands but supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the other hand, the law demands but never supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord tells us to do something, He supplies us with what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever Christ asks us to do, He always supplies us with that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord demands that we be like Him, that is, that we have the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He demands that we behave, that we live, act, and conduct ourselves like God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the Ten Commandments, God is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law demands that we be persons who correspond with what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law, however, does not supply love, light, holiness, or righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ, on the other hand, came to supply us with all that He is to meet what He demands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ as the embodiment of God came into us to impart all the fullness of God into us, including love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ came into us not to demand but to give, to supply, and to impart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The law is demanding, but Christ as grace is within us giving, supplying, and imparting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law demands that we be what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to love others because God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to walk in the light because God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since God is holy, we have to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since God is righteous, we have to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The law always demands, but Christ came as the embodiment of God to live within us and to impart love, light, holiness, and righteousness to us with all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ephesians 5 tells the wives to submit themselves to their own husbands v. 22 . But we also have to remember that Paul charges us to do everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether this charge is a law or grace to us is dependent upon what we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many wedding pastors make Ephesians 5 a word of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But this portion of the Word is not a part of the law but of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ as grace imparts Himself into us to become our very submission.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The wives' submission to their own husbands should be nothing less than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more you love Christ, the more you take Him as your life, the more you live by Him, the more you will spontaneously and unconsciously be sweetly submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This sweet submission is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is grace, not a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Ephesians 5 also tells the brothers who are husbands to love their wives v. 25 . Some brothers would say that they cannot love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should not try to charge such brothers to love their wives according to the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Moses cannot get through, but Christ can get through.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We may say, "Brother, what you have told me about your wife may be absolutely true.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But do you realize that Christ lives in you?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Do you love Him?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do you live by Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The brother may respond by saying that he loves and lives by Christ to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we can say, "I encourage you to go to the Lord again.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Consecrate yourself to Him, open yourself to Him, and take Him in more and more to live by Him more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then see what will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Forget about the command to love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Just look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Open up to Him more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Take Him as your life more and more and see what will come out."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If he takes this fellowship, he will experience Christ spontaneously and unconsciously as the love for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Such love is imparted by Christ and with Christ and can never be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Since you have Christ, you have love.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Love is not a law, it is a grace; it is not a demand but an imparting.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The law was given by Moses, but grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Grace was not given by Jesus but came through Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When we have Jesus, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Gospel of John does not tell us about the law but about grace.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It tells us that the Word, which is God Himself, was incarnated to be the flesh and was full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we receive Him, we enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is like the ocean coming to the land wave upon wave.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Grace is God Himself given to us and enjoyed by us.</S>
