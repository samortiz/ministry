   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Concerning the Ground of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The extract of the definition of the church ground is to keep the oneness of the Spirit inwardly and to take the differences outwardly, not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Keeping the oneness of the Spirit is inward, whereas the differences are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one brother is a Sabbath keeper and another brother practices meeting on the Lord's Day, the differences between them are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to keep the oneness of the Spirit inwardly, and we have to take the differences outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the essence of the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ground of the church involves not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Baptism, speaking in tongues, sprinkling, immersion, and dietary preferences are all differences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But none of these differences should separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should be separated only by the localities in which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we live in Anaheim, we cannot meet together regularly with the saints in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are in Anaheim, it is also difficult for us to meet with the saints in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our locality spontaneously separates us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are separated outwardly, but we are still one inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are one in the Spirit with the saints in New York, London, and Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>L. All the Trainings by the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should Be Stopped</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The dissenting ones demanded that all the trainings by the ministry be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was their opinion, but I have my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who have caused divisions among us have accused me of using the trainings to control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rebellion with these ones began in September 1987, while I was in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Shortly after I came back to the United States in December 1987, four of the dissenting ones came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They made some demand of me and warned me that they would cut off my publications and tapes if I did not comply with their demand and that the church in Anaheim would take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One of them said to me with a furious tone that the training in Taipei should be dismantled into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again I say, they have their opinion, but I have my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not right to interfere with another person's burden by your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more I prayed about the training, the more burdened I became.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consider what the situation among the churches in the recovery would be if the trainings were taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I went to Shanghai for the first time in 1933, Brother Watchman Nee talked with me about the need for a training.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A number of us were under his continual training.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, he had two big trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1948 over eighty people went to his place on a mountain to be trained by him for nearly half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1949 he had a second big training, and I was there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostle Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years Acts 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For two years he spoke the word of the Lord in the school of Tyrannus in order to teach people 19:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I consider his teaching of people in that school to be something like a training.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely there were church meetings in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if Paul did not do something in addition to the church meetings, why would he have needed to use a place which was like a school?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there were no need for the saints to be trained, why would Paul stay in the city of Ephesus for three years?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have had our trainings mainly based upon Paul's example.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have a burden to train the seeking saints and young saints with the word of the Lord.</S>
