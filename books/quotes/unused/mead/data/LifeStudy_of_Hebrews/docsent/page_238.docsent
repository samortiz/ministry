   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SHAPING FUNCTION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In understanding the Bible, we have been influenced too much by our natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past, I said that the function of the law of life was to regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this concept, if we are about to argue with our wife, the law of life will regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This teaching, which is according to our natural concept, is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its apple-tree life has the apple-tree nature, and issuing from this apple-tree nature is the law of the apple life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does the law of life in the apple tree regulate it from being wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Absolutely not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law of the apple life does not function this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How then does it function?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the life of an apple tree grows, its law shapes the form of its life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, when an apple tree bears fruit, it bears fruit with the proper form, the form of apples.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same is true of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the law of life does not regulate us from doing wrong; it regulates the shape of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a certain life does not grow, the law of that life cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law only operates as the life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law of life does not primarily function in the negative sense of telling us what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, rather, while life grows the law of life functions in the positive sense of shaping us, that is, conforming us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the function of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that the law of life will always correct you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, when you are about to exchange words with your wife, the law of life will not merely restrict you from arguing with her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The working of the law of life is not as low as we have thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to our human, natural, religious concept, we have greatly depreciated the function of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have been sin-centered and sin-conscious, but we should be neither sin-centered nor sin-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though we are occupied with overcoming sin, the world, our ugly flesh, and our bad habits, God would say, Forget about these things!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don t you realize that on the day you were regenerated you were transferred out of one realm into another?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Will you please forget about the old realm?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise God that we have been born of Him!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This divine birth has transferred us into a new realm, a realm in which there is no sin, world, or flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this realm there is the function of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Remember that the law of life is not mainly regulating us; it is mainly shaping us, conforming us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past, I saw this matter of the law of life, but being under the influence of my natural understanding, I thought that the function of the law of life was mainly to regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This natural understanding frustrated the vision of the function of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently, I was rebuked by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord asked me, Who told you that the law of life mainly regulates?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot find such a word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why don t you use the words of Romans 8:2 and 29?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law of life in Romans 8:2 does not regulate us from being wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This concept is according to our human, natural, ethical, religious understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need a vision of Romans 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are now in another realm and do not need any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this realm there is no sin, world, flesh, or self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider two trees, an apple tree and a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have no sin, world, flesh, or self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But both trees have a law of life which shapes them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shaping by the law of life is the meaning of the word conformed in Romans 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The law of the Spirit of life conforms us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the life grows, the law conforms us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can Christ be formed in us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only by the positive working of the law of life which shapes us to His form.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a difference between this reality and our natural concept!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Satan is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the Bible tells us clearly of the function of the law of life, we have been blinded by our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many saints who were seeking after the Lord but who were blinded by their natural concept have written books on how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not try to overcome sin, it may lie dormant in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if you try to overcome it, it will say, What!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you trying to defeat me?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many of us have some weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we pay no attention to them, they will remain idle and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we are aware of them and, for the sake of our holiness, try to overcome them, they will rise up and defeat us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is best for us not to touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord that we have had a new birth, a divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this new birth there are no weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is only the divine life with the divine nature and the divine law which shapes us and conforms us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, this shaping requires the growth in life, for the law of life only functions as life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The law of life does not regulate us from sin, because it is not in the realm of sin; it is in the realm of the divine life where there is no sin, world, flesh, or self.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As life grows, its law works, not mainly to regulate or correct us, but to shape us, to conform us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eventually, through the function of the law of life, we all shall become the mature sons of God, and God will have His universal, corporate expression.</S>
