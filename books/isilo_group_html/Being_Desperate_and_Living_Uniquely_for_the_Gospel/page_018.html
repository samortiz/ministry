To preach the high gospel: Acts 8:4-5<br>2. To teach the pure truth: 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:2</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEFINITION OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>The gospel is Christ, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God for our enjoyment. According to the truth, the gospel is the entire New Testament. Christians are used to saying that there are four Gospels, but Paul told us that the entire book of Romans is the gospel of God (1:1, 15). It includes the preaching of God, the condemnation of God upon fallen man, and the Body life, including the local churches in chapter sixteen. Have you ever received such a broad view of the definition of the gospel? Personally, the gospel is a wonderful person, and according to the truth, the gospel is the entire divine revelation of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. God's New Testament economy is the gospel. We have to believe in such a gospel, preach such a gospel, and live uniquely for such a gospel. The consummated Spirit, who is God Himself reaching us, eventually has become the seven Spirits in Revelation (1:4; 4:5; 5:6). The seven Spirits are also a part of the gospel.</P><P>Truthwise, the gospel is the entire revelation of God's New Testament economy, including the first verse of Matthew, "Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham," and including the last verse of Revelation, "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen." Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, in Matthew 1:1 is the very grace in Revelation 22:21. In the first chapter of Matthew, the first chapter of the entire New Testament, we are also told that God was born into Mary (v. 20). The gospel includes God being born in Mary. The conception of the Savior was God's incarnation (John 1:14). The Gospel of Matthew also includes the church. In Matthew 16 Jesus Christ our Lord told His disciples He would build His church upon this rock, the revelation concerning Himself as the Christ, the Son of the living God (vv. 16-18). In Matthew 24:14 the Lord told us that the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, which is the gospel of Matthew, will be preached to the whole inhabited earth.</P><P>Consider how much truth is in the Gospel of John, especially in chapters fourteen through sixteen, concerning the divine Trinity and concerning you and me as branches of the processed Triune God. Do you realize that we are the branches of the processed Triune God (15:5)? When I come to the details of John 14-16, I get excited. The Son is in the Father, the Father is in the Son (14:10-11), and eventually this Son is realized as the Spirit (14:17-20), so the entire Triune God comes to make an abode with us (14:23). Where are you now? You have to say that you are in the processed Triune God. And where is He now? In us. This mutual abode of us in the Triune God and He in us is the church, and this is the central point, the focus, of the Gospel of John.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Desperate and Living Uniquely for the Gospel &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
