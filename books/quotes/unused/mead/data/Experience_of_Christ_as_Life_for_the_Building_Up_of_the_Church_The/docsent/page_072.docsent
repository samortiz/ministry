   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many of you young brothers and sisters love the Lord, but be assured that the way you are taking is the way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since you love the Lord so much, you are on the way of sufferings all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord for the enjoyment of Christ that comes through the sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the sufferings, it is hard to have the rich enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can have only a superficial enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The deep enjoyment of Christ comes through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I cannot tell you what kind of sufferings you will have, but the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Step by step and year after year, He knows what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He knows what kind of suffering is needed to form a ministry in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Corinthians 6:8 Paul said that he commended himself as a minister of God not only through a good report but also through an evil report.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The good report comes from the believers and those who receive the truth preached and taught by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The evil report comes from the opposers and persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the apostle Paul there were the evil reports, and if we are following the Lord in an absolute way, our experience will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The evil reports are a real suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said that his commendation was "through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true" v. 8 . Glory is from God and those who love Him; dishonor is from the devil and those who follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul was a deceiver in the eyes of the Judaizers and the people of other religions and philosophies, but true in the eyes of those who loved the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 9 Paul said, "As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostles were unknown in the sense of not displaying themselves, but well known in the sense of witnessing to the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, the apostles were dying in suffering persecutions, but on the other hand, they were living in the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, they were being disciplined in the opposers' superficial realization.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No doubt, the opposers said that Paul must have done something wrong toward God, so God was chastening him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But actually Paul was living in the sovereign care of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the Second World War, I was imprisoned in China by the invading Japanese army, and during that time I experienced the Lord in a special and rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since you are in the hand of the Lord, you have to be prepared for sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These sufferings produce the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the early part of my ministry, when I heard the evil reports and the false accusations, I was unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But today when I hear these things, I am happy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today I can thank the Lord for my imprisonment and for all the opposition and evil reports.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 10 Paul said, "As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This describes the way of the Lord's servants, the way of those who love the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is through this way of suffering that a ministry will be produced with you so that you can really minister Christ to others as life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Corinthians 11 shows us that a minister of Christ is always passing through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not expect that we will not have any sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Never be surprised when some suffering comes to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suffering brings you the blessing, and produces a ministry for you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul spoke of the sufferings in his surroundings, his circumstances, and his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then when he came to chapter twelve he spoke of a thorn in his flesh, which refers to a very subjective, physical suffering in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2 Corinthians we do not see healings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we see a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul entreated the Lord three times to remove this thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was not an ordinary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord answered by saying that He would not take away this thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He would leave the thorn with Paul so that Paul could experience how sufficient the Lord's grace is and how perfect His power is in our weakness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The apostle Paul was used by the Lord to heal others, but he could not get his physical problem healed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord denied his request and told him that He would leave the thorn with him so that he might experience the Lord's sufficient grace and realize His perfect power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was through these kinds of sufferings that Paul could have such a wonderful ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul did not consider himself to be a preacher or an expositor but a minister of Christ, dispensing Christ as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ministry is produced through sufferings and even kept through sufferings.</S>
