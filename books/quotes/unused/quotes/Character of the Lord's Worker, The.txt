These messages however have been newly translated and entitled The Character of the Lords Worker conforming to the original Chinese title
The book covers ten character traits that are crucial to the usefulness of a Christian worker in the Master's hand
We have to consider matters of character, habit, and conduct when considering the qualifications necessary to be in God's employment
A worker is of little use to God if he can only speak to others, if he can only blast incessantly at others like a firecracker
If he can only speak to others, but cannot listen to them and realize their problems through conversation, his usefulness is very limited
Others come to you with a burden on their shoulders; they try to unload their problems to you and expect some help from you
We may have no idea how he has been living, what his family background is, or what his condition before the Lord is
We have to know what a person has not said, that is, the things he should tell us but which have been kept back
After the first kind of words are spoken, we still have to listen to the second kind, the kind that are not spoken
When a brother comes and says something to us, we must not only be clear about what he is saying, but also about what he is not saying
His spirit will find some measure of release in the opening of his mouth, however much he may try to contain himself
If we are not that exercised we may listen to a brothers problems for half an hour without realizing his real ailment and the remedy for it
If we cannot understand the audible words from man, how can we understand the words that God speaks to us in our spirit?
If we are unable to diagnose the ailment, condition, or problem of a brother who is in trouble, what word can we give to him?
We have to spend time to learn to listen to others, to hear what they have said, what they have not said, and what is in their spirit
A joke is told of an elderly doctor whose entire stock of medicine consisted of two things: castor oil and quinine
Everyone who bears God's trust and commission possesses one common ability he knows what others are saying as soon as they open their mouth
They are set in their mind as to what they want to say, and they have nothing to say other than their own premeditated admonitions
We have to learn to give up our subjectivity, to listen carefully, to hear what others are saying, and to find out their problem
They accumulate so many things in their mind that there is no room for anything more when others try to convey their thoughts to them
We cannot understand what others are saying merely by understanding their words; we have to be able to feel what they feel
A person with hardened feelings cannot enter into the feelings of others, and he cannot understand what others say
We may feel something, but we must be objective in regard to our own feelings before we can have the capacity to feel what he feels
Not only should we give our time and strength to them; we should make our affections available to them as well
Not only should we help them solve their problems; we should accommodate their feelings with our feelings as well
If our emotions are overactive and we are preoccupied with our own feelings, we will never be able to enter into others' feelings
If we do not have any joy or sorrow of our own, but are fully available before the Lord, we will be able to enter into others' feelings
If we are constantly busy with our own feelings, we will be too preoccupied to feel for others when they come to us
If we indulge in our own laughter and tears and in our own likes and dislikes, we will have no room within for the needs of others
If we cling to our own pleasures and griefs, begrudging the letting go of this and that, we will be too full to take care of others
Many brothers and sisters cannot work for the Lord because they have expended all their love on themselves and have none to spare for others
We need to realize that there is a limit to our soul-strength just as there is a limit to our physical strength
The Lord Himself said, 'If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters,
We must remember that our inner being must be like a spotless piece of blank paper before others can write on it
The most important thing related to a worker is not his measure of knowledge but the person of the worker himself
If we can listen to others, know their condition, and get into their thoughts and feelings, we will have a way to help them
Generally speaking, we should give others enough time to speak, and we should give ourselves enough time to listen
We have to realize the complexity of our work; we are dealing with living human beings, and we are tackling living problems
As we are dealing with a person's problem before God, we should be still and quiet to receive something from the Lord
We can skip many things, but we can never skip the basic dealings, without which no one can serve the Lord in a proper way
There is a prevalent misconception among Christian workers that the most essential thing is to be able to speak
We have to identify the spiritual problems plaguing the brothers and sisters, and we have to know how to deal with them
We test an unbeliever according to this measuring stick, and we also test a child of God according to this measuring stick
If we are off within, we will easily make a wrong judgment, and once we make a wrong judgment, we will spoil His work
Even the Lord Jesus became a man when He came to earth a man like other men, gradually growing from infancy to full maturity
God's intention is to set up a 'standard' man, a representative man, in whom all the plans of God are realized
When our Lord was on earth He said For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many
Whether or not we will build up a good spiritual work depends on how much we love man and how much interest we have in man
The Son of Man's coming firstly implies that the Lord was intensely interested in man; He was so interested in man that He became a man
It also means that He is interested in man, that He has a feeling for man, and that He has a high regard for man
Brothers and sisters, do we know the meaning of the phrase the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve?
Years of instruction have accustomed us to address all men as our fellow men however this is not a matter of words but a matter of feeling
We should not allow them to suffer, we should not take advantage of them, and we should not seek for any service from them
As far as receiving from others is concerned, our Lord's basic attitude is that He would never allow Himself to be served by men
We must remember that we should never selfishly receive the services and ministration of others at the expense of their sacrifice and loss
God's children should not take advantage of others, not only because the Lord has forbidden it, but because we are fellow human beings
If we have no interest in man, our work will be of very limited value in the sight of God, no matter how great it may be outwardly
Mark 10:45 says, 'The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many'
Because he is lovable, the Lord did not say that it was 'the Son of God' who came to serve, but 'the Son of Man' who came
We should not think that we can first preach His sacrifice and then love the listener after he has received the Lord
If we have never been touched by the expression God created man or have very little feeling for it we are unfit to preach Christs sacrifice
In the same way, we should be interested in men, counting them worthy of our love and grace, before we present the Lord's redemption to them
If God opens our heart to see that we are fellow men among all men, our attitude towards them will drastically change
Brothers and sisters, it needs to dawn on us that man is precious in God's eyes because He created man in His likeness
Many brothers and sisters have an altogether wrong attitude, temperament, and sentiment toward their fellow men
If we regarded man as lovable, we would not feel that man is a burden, trouble, nuisance, or an annoyance to us
In other words, even if only one person in the whole world were lost, the Lord would still have come to the earth
The Father did not wait for His prodigal because all of His sons had become prodigal; He opened His arms to one prodigal who returned
We think that some people are too ignorant and others are too hard, but these problems should not stop us from loving them
If there is love there will not be any disdain for man and God will bring us to the point that we take our place as men among our fellow men
It is right to humble oneself, but it is wrong to consciously think that we are humbling ourselves by walking among certain kinds of people
If we feel that we are humbling ourselves when we walk among less educated ones, this is proof that we are not humble enough
When our Lord came to earth, men only recognized Him as the son of Mary or as the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon
When we talk with those who have less education than we have and we stand aloof from them, we are telling them that we are not one of them
Grace will never cause you to uplift yourself; it will always cause you to see that you are the same as the wicked and the sinners
You should give more thanks for grace; you should spend more time thanking the Lord for grace instead of giving glory to yourself
If a brother has an enlarged heart and is interested in men, his usefulness in the hand of God will be greatly enhanced
It is strange indeed for us to be preachers of the gospel and to be afraid of meeting people at the same time!
God wants them, and He gave His only begotten Son for them with the expectation that they would receive His life through believing into Him
When a man is enlightened by God to see that he is begotten by the same Father as his brothers, he develops a special taste for them
If we have this attitude we will touch the things of God while living on earth today because Gods attention is always directed towards man
Unless we can do this, we will not be able to identify with the Lord's feeling, and we will not be able to work for the Lord
Before we consider this subject from a positive point of view, let us first consider the common Christian concept of suffering
There is a certain philosophy which promotes physical suffering as a means of depriving the body of all enjoyment
As the Lord's workers and those who represent Him, we must be clear that this philosophy should not be in a Christian's mind at all
He watched over His own faithfully, relieved their distresses and pains, and drew a clear distinction between His people and the nations
For the sake of serving God, we would rather gladly choose a way that is different from that of ordinary people
Without such a mind, we will produce little results in our work, and the work we do will be very superficial in quality
It is not a question of whether you have encountered something outwardly, but whether you have a mind to suffer inwardly
When the Lord provides smooth circumstances, abundance in material supply, and good health to them, they can serve Him happily
When the Lord changes His course circumstantially and trials come upon us, we will accept them fortuitously, not counting them as strange
The Scripture shows us that we should arm ourselves with a mind to suffer; that is, our mind should be an armory, a weapon, to us
There are some brothers and sisters who endure suffering, but they have no conception of the preciousness of the suffering
They may even murmur and complain continually, hoping for the day when they will be delivered from their suffering
Brothers and sisters, if we do not have a mind to suffer during peaceful times, we will only be fit to travel on smooth roads
When many brothers and sisters encounter sufferings and afflictions, they complain and cry for help day after day
It may be true that our situations are unpleasant, but how much of a willing mind to suffer for the Lord do we have?
There is little sign of hardship in the circumstance of one, while the other may be obviously in great distress
We must remember that God has demands on us, and in order to meet these demands, there is the need for us to have a mind to suffer
As soon as we face troubles, we will draw back, and as soon as we are called upon to pay a price, we will give up
We are not concerned with how much suffering a person experiences; we are concerned with how much of a mind to suffer one has
According to our natural concept, we would conclude that a brother who suffers much knows God's grace in fuller measure
He may indeed be suffering, but he has not yielded to the suffering, and he is going through his experience reluctantly
What the Lord treasures is a mind to suffer a conscious readiness for suffering, not the experience of suffering itself
Brothers and sisters, whether or not we will perform well in our work depends a great deal on whether we have a mind to suffer
If we have a mind to suffer, we will defy difficulties; we will defy hardship; we will defy physical infirmity; and we will even defy death
If we are inwardly afraid of anything, Satan will threaten us with that very same thing, and we will be defeated
If we say, 'I am afraid of sickness,' Satan will surely send us sickness, because he knows that sickness will bring us down
If we do not have a mind to suffer, Satan will use whatever we are afraid of to attack us, and we will be defeated
If we have this attitude within us, Satan will not be able to do anything to us because we will have a mind to suffer
If we do not have such a mind, Satan will seize our weakness, and we will be finished and proven unprofitable for anything
You can thank the Lord if He provides you with food and clothing, and you also can thank Him if He does not provide you with these things
If you have been provided with a comfortable bed, however, there is no virtue in going out of your way to sleep on the floor
We will be too busy feeling sorry for ourselves and loving ourselves, and there will be no more energy to take care of the Lord's work!
If we consider our own life to be so precious and hold ourselves carefully by the hand all the time we will not accomplish much in Gods work
The actual amount of suffering which the Lord has measured to us may be limited, but our readiness for suffering should be unlimited
Satan attacked Job because he scoffed at the idea that Job could possibly not have a desire to preserve his own life
The passage in Revelation shows that Satan cannot do anything about those who do not love their soul-life even unto death
Only those who have a mind to suffer who have an unlimited capacity to suffer who will not love their soullife even unto death can serve Him
The Lord may not want us to give up our life, but we should have the conviction that we will love not our soul-life even unto death
Brothers and sisters, too many failures in the work have resulted from man's own laziness, self-protection, and self-preservation
Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible
He did not agree with those who, under the influence of asceticism, teach that the body is an encumbrance which we must seek to get rid of
Ascetics believe that the body is the source of sin, and that one must treat it severely before the problem of sin can be resolved
The Bible tells us that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit and that a day is coming when this body will be redeemed and glorified
They are strictly regulated as to what they can eat and what they cannot eat, when they can sleep and when they should wake up
All of the faculties of the body are reserved for just one thing running, the kind of running that will win first prize
A runner had to go through long periods of training before he could have a chance to win such a corruptible crown
One has to exercise self-control in running the race, and as Christians we also have to exercise self-control in our Christian life
We shall only mention a few practical examples food, clothing, rest, sleep, comfort, and special care in times of sickness
We should not think that a certain measure of spirituality is all that is necessary to engage in the Lord's work
Some spiritual problems can be solved in an instant, but the buffeting of the body requires three, five, or even ten years
Those who have developed a habit of loose living need all the more to impose a strict discipline upon themselves
In order for us to buffet our body and make it our slave, we should not insist on sleeping when there is the need to be awake
When the Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, He took three of His disciples aside and said to them, 'Watch with Me'
When He found them sleeping on His return, He said to Peter, 'So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour'?
If the Lord requires us to watch with Him and we cannot overcome this 'legitimate' need, we will hinder His work
For the sake of learning to follow the Lord and to buffet our body, we should learn to forsake our sleep for a night or two when necessary
The normal capacity of the body can support our walk, but in running the body is called upon to put forth extra effort
The demand on our body is not as strenuous during normal times of walking; it only becomes strenuous when the body has to run
If our work requires that we work four more hours one day, we should be satisfied with only four hours of sleep
When the three disciples failed to watch with the Lord, He pointed out the trouble to them: 'The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak'
A willing spirit and sleeping flesh amount to the same thing as an unwilling spirit and sleeping flesh; both amount to nothing
We must train our body not just to meet ordinary demands but to have an extra supply when there are extra demands
We do not agree with those who do not pray during the day but who give up their sleep at night for prayer; this is not normal
Remember the occasion when the Lord sat down at noon beside Jacob's well to rest while the disciples went to get some food in the city
If we arrive at a certain place and cannot do anything until we have had a meal, our body is not serving us as it should
If we can never forego our own needs when the work demands our immediate attention, we will have little effective work
When his work calls for his sacrifice, his body should not ignore the call of the work if the comforts he was accustomed to are not provided
Making our body our slave means that we will not be affected by our circumstances when the work calls for our attention
Many poorer brothers collapse physically as soon as they are given a lot that is inferior to what they are used to
When a need arises, we should be like Paul, who, even though he was in hunger and thirst and nakedness, continued to serve the Lord
Many workers of the Lord love themselves so much that they excuse themselves from work as soon as they are slightly sick
At least he would not have written the book to the Galatians, for that book was written at the time when his eyes were very weak
When our work calls for it, we should set aside the demand of our sickness and take care of the demand of the work
It is true that sickness demands rest, but when the work calls for sacrifice, even a sick body has to heed to its call
When the Lord's work demands and commands us to do something, we have to do it, even though our body may still be in pain
Brothers and sisters, in working for the Lord and in our service to Him, we often have to restrict the demands of the body
When a need arises in the work and the body is called upon to deny its cravings, can we be strong enough to deny them?
You must exercise discretion to care for your body, but at the same time, you must take full control of your body
If we cannot put our body under strict control, as soon as we face any trial in our work, we will grumble, complain, or run away
We should say, 'Lord, my troubles can never match the troubles You faced when You were sojourning on the earth'
Those who have never buffeted their body or made it their slave will fall back as soon as they are put in a race
All the great servants of the Lord are under His strict rule; they all exercise strict control over their own body
Today we take our body along with us to the work, and even when our body is sick or in pain, it still has to obey us
If we want to learn to serve the Lord, we have to exercise ourselves, control ourselves, and rule over ourselves every day
Some young people manifest qualities that give you the confident expectation that they will develop into useful servants of Christ
From the very beginning, they give others the impression that they are good seeds and that they will blossom and bring forth fruit
There are others who are quite confident of themselves and who consider themselves quite highly, but before long, they fall by the way
We have to learn to listen to the brothers, to humble ourselves before the Lord, to seek after Him, and to deal with Him in many aspects
If our character and disposition do not go through some severe constituting work of the Spirit, we cannot expect much result from our work
Matthew 25:18, 24-28, 30 says, 'But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master's money
His evil was manifested in his calling his master 'a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow'
Many Christians also adopt this attitude; they view big matters as being small, and small matters as being nothing
Those who are always looking for an opportunity for rest and recreation are not worthy of being called God's servants
Paul said, 'Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching'
He was either traveling from place to place, preaching the gospel wherever he went, or reasoning intently with individuals and teaching them
Whether the words are translated as idle, slothful, sluggish, irksome, or dull, they all mean a refusal or reluctance to work or do things
It seems as if they are being asked to take up an impossible task and that a very heavy burden has been placed upon them
Many brothers and sisters have become useless in God's service because they are afraid to take on any responsibility
They would rather choose less responsibility than more responsibility, and they would be happy to settle for no responsibility at all
It seems as if no one has control over them; no brother or sister can touch them, and no one can say anything to them
In mans view one had to wait four months but the Lord said Lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are already white for harvest
It is not a matter of taking care of what is in our hands, but a matter of lifting up our eyes to look for things to do
God is moving and acting behind many things, and we have to lift up our eyes to look for them in order to find them
If we have not looked to God for work, prayed for work, and found work, we are lazy, and we will not be able to accomplish much work
Their hands have already touched the things that they should do, yet they still say that they do not know what they should do
Those whom God uses are men who expend their energy, who always look for things to do, and who are never loose
They have never thought of gaining more men for the Lord or spreading the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth
For these things existing in you and abounding constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
If we only preach the doctrine of diligence, we only have to exhort others to be diligent, and we only need to say it once
He was showing us that one can only be diligent when he adds to what he has again and again until he has these things in abundance
We want to be those who are happy and willing to work and who constantly seek for an opportunity to serve the Lord
All who are afraid of work and responsibility and who have no desire to do anything are not qualified to serve God
Jude says the same thing in verse 3: 'Beloved, while using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation
Brothers and sisters, our time is almost gone; the need is ever so desperate, and our responsibility is ever so great
Let us, as dying men with fleeting breath and fading opportunity, give ourselves fully to preach the gospel to those who are dying around us
If they try to bring their character habits and disposition into the Lords work they will find that they are holding back the Lords work!
We work because we have a burden, because we know that the time is short, the need is great, and Satan's attack is fierce
It can turn a man of riches into a man who works only to a third, a fifth, or merely a tenth of what he is capable of!
In the parable we see two possible charges facing us at the judgment seat the charge of 'evil' and the charge of 'slothful'
At that time the Lord Himself will pronounce the judgment: 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness'
Many people in the past have become useless and have fallen by the wayside, wasting themselves through their slothfulness
Since slothfulness is a habit that has been built up over the years, we cannot hope to correct it in a day or two
We expect those who are accustomed to laziness to be all the more conscientious in dealing with their slothfulness
No slothful person can produce a proper work, because the disposition of a lazy man always tries to ignore or put off things
Every servant of God should take all kinds of responsibilities upon himself; he should not be afraid of troubles
Our mouth can be the outlet through which God's power flows, or it can be a hole through which the divine power leaks away
Before the Lord we should realize that once we consecrate our mouth to be Gods oracle we have a great responsibility upon our shoulders
They all perished for their sin, but the censers remained holy and were beaten into plates for a covering of the altar
Whatsoever has been offered to God and used by Him is set apart for Him and cannot be put to common use afterwards
Some brothers and sisters have a wrong concept; they think that they can speak God's word one minute and Satan's word the next
If our mouth has once spoken God's word, we have to realize that we have no right to speak just anything when we open our mouth again
Once something is consecrated to God, it becomes God's possession forever; we can never take back what we have given to Him
Their mouths are sanctified for His service; they are holy, and their mouth should be guarded as jealously as one guards his heart
Many people will not tell you some things because they know that you are not like them, and it would be useless to say that thing to you
In listening others are speaking in believing others words are received and in passing on words ones whole being is put into the words
Brothers and sisters, if we cannot bridle our tongue, how can we control ourselves and how can we serve the Lord?
Inaccuracy in words, being double-tongued, and vacillation in our statements are marks of weakness in character
Matthew 21:23-27 records that the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the Lord and asked on whose authority He was acting
In Matthew 5:37 the Lord said, 'But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one'
Paul exhorted the Corinthians saying If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age let him become foolish that he may become wise
If our words are not disciplined, we may be building up God's work with one hand and destroying it with the other
It is wrong to listen with curiosity to what others have to say and to treat their words as stories or tall tales
These words are entrusted to us; they are not our possessions but are objects entrusted to us in our ministry and our divine service
If our responsibility or God's work or human needs calls for their divulgence, that is another story altogether
All utterances that are made with an intent to give a false hope or a wrong impression fall into the category of lying
Sometimes a lie may not contain any false statement, but it is skillfully spoken to give others a false impression
We have to remember that honesty in our speech is a matter of motive; it is not simply a matter of correctness in words
We want people to believe the truth; therefore, we dare not use words that are true in order to convey a false impression
The Lord once spoke very strongly to the Jews: 'You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father
If we can so easily veer off when we are trying to be accurate, how much more we will be off the mark if we are not consciously trying
The Bible prophesied of the Lord: 'He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets'
He or she must have been living an undisciplined life for many years before he or she could shout with little restraint
We should restrict ourselves and exercise discipline over our own voice, like the Lord, whose voice was not heard in the streets
The fact remains that those who have never been disciplined in their speaking will face difficult times in the work
We hope that all the workers of the Lord will learn to be finer and more tender and that no one will be rough and uncouth
If we do not pay attention to accuracy in facts, we will be of little use to the Lord even if our words are correct
In speaking, we should take care not only of the words themselves but should go deeper to our motive and care for the facts
Following this the Lord says, 'For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned'
Words of greeting have to do with maintaining human relationships, and it is proper to have them in our conversation
The Lord Jesus says, 'Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment'
All idle words will be repeated; a person will have to render an account concerning them in the day of judgment
One day we will discover the many idle words that we have spoken, and God will justify us or condemn us based on these words
Others may scoff and jest in all kinds of ways, but God's children should not allow these things to come out of their mouth
There are many other kinds of unfitting words, such as words spoken behind others' backs or words of criticism
As for reviling words, they are sin and should be refused ; they definitely should not come out of a Christian's mouth
Some brothers can gain others' ears when they say something, while others may say the same thing yet not command any attention
Brothers and sisters, let us remember that a spring cannot send forth from the same opening sweet and bitter water
When clean water and filthy water are mixed together, the filthy water does not become clean; rather, the clean water becomes filthy
The first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and the third until the seventh
They thought that it would be better if there was no such thing as resurrection, because it would complicate things
They spoke so carelessly that it was impossible for them to appreciate the absolute accuracy of God's utterances
A sloppy character does not care for accuracy and is incapable of accuracy; it is not capable of holding and containing God's accurate word
If he is sloppy when he walks off the platform, how can he be anything but sloppy when he stands on the platform?
We have to guard our spiritual worth, our spiritual weight, and our spiritual usefulness before the Lord by every means
The problem of unrestrained words may be more serious than slothfulness, a failure to listen, or the lack of having a mind to suffer
Many of the words we uttered in the past were 'idle words,' but they are no longer 'idle'; they are spreading all over the earth
At the time we spoke them, they were idle words, but after a while they have become very busy and are working great havoc
If He will deal with us and burn our tongues so that we will no longer open our mouth rashly, we will be spared many regrets in the future
Only when the Lord puts our mouth under strict control and it ceases to say things carelessly can we expect Him to use us as His mouthpiece
We may say that we are burdened to serve God and to share in His work but we cannot speak Gods word one moment and the devils word the next
When three, five, eight, or ten people are talking together, it is a great temptation to join in and be part of them
When other brothers and sisters are engaged in improper conversation, the first thing we have to do is to separate ourselves from them
Every time something like this happens, we must not give in to temptation and we must not associate ourselves with the others
Many people are unreliable by nature, not because they want to be unreliable, but because their character is unreliable
When Peter said 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,' he must have at least touched the life of God
Brothers and sisters, being with the Lord Jesus, following Him, and being beside Him do not guarantee one a knowledge of Him
He said that we should build our house upon the rock so that it will not fall when the rain and water and wind come
Even if the church is subject to the rain, water, and wind, it will never collapse, because it is firmly built upon the rock
The foundation of the church is a rock, something unshakable, and the church itself is made of stones which are also unshakable
Although the stone is not as big as the rock, it has the same nature as the rock, and it is equally unshakable
Today not all who are called Peter are Peters, in the same way that not all who are called by the name of Israel are men of strength
They cannot serve the church, because they cannot stand firm and upright, and the gates of Hades easily prevail over them
The Lord put such a person before us to show us how unstable a person's nature can be before he is dealt with by the Lord
Before such a person becomes a stone, he cannot use the keys and cannot be useful to God in any particular way
As soon as God's light touches us, either through a message or through a brother's direct rebuke, something in us wilts away
The Lord chose one man and called him Peter, and after He made him a 'Peter,' He gave him the keys to bring men into the church
Peter did not deserve any merit, but the Father's revelation enabled him to see the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
If we are not wrong in our understanding, we can safely say that no revelation in the four Gospels reached the height of Peter's revelation
It was the Father who had given Peter the revelation; he knew the Lord as 'the Christ, the Son of the living God'
One minute he was speaking according to the Father; the next minute he turned around and was speaking according to Satan
They cannot be one way one day and another way the next day, saying one thing one moment and another thing another moment
If we are solid and firm before the Lord we will see what the church really is and we will see blessing and victory over the gates of Hades
We must remember that we do not know anything about many of the things that we say to the Lord at the time of our consecration and revival
When their emotion is dealt with by the Lord, they will realize that their heart and emotion are two different things
Although his name indicated that he was a stone, his character was like water; it flowed one way one moment and another way the next moment
Was a person who was so sure in his speaking and who felt the same way in himself, but who did everything just the opposite
He said he would never be stumbled, and according to his feeling, he sincerely believed that he would never be stumbled
A while later, he gathered up his energy, drew up his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear
One moment he could draw out his sword and cut someone, yet in the next moment he lost his boldness altogether
After the slave girl first spoke to Peter about being with Jesus the Nazarene, Peter denied it and went outside into the forecourt
After a little while, those standing by again said to Peter, 'Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean as well'
When the slave girl first talked to him, he denied the Lord and moved to the forecourt because he could no longer remain in the same place
By the time those who were standing around echoed the words that he had been with Jesus, he did not just make an oath; he cursed and swore
He not only invoked God's name to assure others that he did not know Jesus; he even cursed that he would be damned if he knew the Lord!
An emotional person can act by the impulse of his emotion and turn around suddenly to rebuke the Lord saying God be merciful to You Lord!
Only those who do not trust in their own feelings, but rather deny them, will be able to learn what it means to live not by feelings
Brothers and sisters, we may feel that we love the Lord, but actually there is no love for the Lord within our being
In the same way, our fickle emotions are detestable, and it is pitiful when we do not know that our emotions are fickle
They feel one way when they come out of 'Gethsemane,' and they feel another way when they enter the 'courtyard'
He loved the Lord as far as his feelings were concerned, but he loved himself more than the Lord as far as his person was concerned
When the critical moment comes, they cannot hold out, because they are afraid of suffering and because they love themselves
What Peter felt compelled to do in the courtyard was the same as what he had done in Caesarea Philippi in front of the Lord
When the Lord spoke to him face to face about the cross, he recoiled by saying, 'God be merciful to You, Lord!
Brothers and sisters, only one kind of person is stable --those who will be faithful even unto death for the Lord
If the cross cannot shake a person, nothing will shake him, for there is no greater requirement than the cross
If you cannot meet the demand of the cross, and instead shrink back from it, you will fail in the face of any test
Brothers and sisters, if the problem of your fear of men is not resolved, you cannot run a straight course before the Lord
The foundation of the church is of stone, the building up of the church is of stone, and the service of the church should be of stone
The church is not composed of thousands of isolated stones; it is composed of stones that are built one upon the other
If one piece shakes, the whole building will be in jeopardy; many lives will be at risk, and God's church will not be able to go on
If our character is shakable and unreliable, everything that is built upon us will be shakable, and sooner or later everything will collapse
If you build upon something that is unreliable, you may build a little only to find that it has to be torn down
Any collapse or damage in the work may be remedied by reconstruction, but five, ten, or twenty years may be lost in the process
When we are stable and trustworthy, we can meet the challenge of any responsibility that falls upon our shoulders
If a man is unreliable, always being up and down, he will fail in the Lord's call for watchfulness and go to sleep
He will want eight hours of sleep and will settle for nothing less, no matter how much he is called upon to be watchful
If a man is not stable before the Lord, he is not reliable, and if he is not reliable, he will not have a sense of responsibility
These keys first opened the door to the Jews, and then the door to the Gentiles, and the church is built up this way
He was changed from a weak and shaking person to a solid and stable person, and the door of Pentecost was opened through him
Subjectivity is another defect in the character of some of God's children, and in particular, of some workers for the Lord
It means to have a preconceived idea before listening to others and to hold on to the idea even after hearing from others
When a man's self is not broken, he has a stubborn view of things, and these opinions are hard to break and correct
When some young people first join the work, it is more difficult to teach them than it is to feed a child medicine
When we meet some brothers, we cannot help but sigh in our heart, 'My brother, how many things can a person like you learn from the Lord'?
One can tell if a person is subjective by the amount of spiritual things he learns and how often he learns them
Not being subjective means that we are sensitive to God, that we can learn, and that we can receive impressions
Many people are like horses and mules, who do not understand anything unless they are led by the bit and bridle
God may wrestle with him and allow him to come to a blind alley or a closed door, yet he is still arguing with God
They become a stumbling block to the work because they have not learned much or received much supply from the Lord all their life
It is impossible for him to know God's will, because he does not match the qualifications of those who are God's followers
We must realize that God's will often requires that we stop immediately, or it may require that we march immediately
A strenuous effort must be made to push forward those who are subjective, and once they start moving, no one can stop them
If Abraham had been a subjective man when God asked him to offer up Isaac, it would have been difficult for him to obey
As he stood by the altar and raised the knife to slay his son, God prepared a ram which he could offer instead of his son
With some people, it is difficult for them to get on the altar, and once they are on the altar, it is more difficult for them to get down
It is interesting to note that when we identify our will with God's will, there often comes a time when God's will changes
In order to break it, a trained rider has to jump on its back and allow it to kick and struggle until it tires itself out
It can balance itself so well that it will not go so far away as to break the rope nor so close as to allow slack in the rope
It will be so trained that as soon as its rider tugs a little on the reins, it will know whether its master wants it to run or walk
Psalm 32:8-9 says, 'I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go;/I will counsel you; my eye is upon you
It should be easier for God's children to be taught in the matter of divine guidance than it is to tame a horse
We may be satisfied being a tamed horse, but God says that a horse and mule, even when tamed, are without understanding
As soon as we become subjective, the self becomes involved, and we are unable to stop when the Lord wants us to stop
The problem with many people is twofold: In the beginning they cannot move, and once they start they cannot stop
If we cannot be flexible to move and stop at God's will, we cannot understand His will and cannot be His servant
Flexibility and openness to God's changes, haltings, and leadings are basic requirements of a worker of the Lord
Unless a person is brought to the point where he has lost all interest in gaining a following, he cannot be used by the Lord
We should allow ourselves to be broken and smashed to the degree that we no longer crave obedience from others
If a man is subjective and if his subjectivity is never broken, he will surely insist on everyone being a virgin and remaining unmarried
He wished that others would be spared of all sufferings of the flesh, yet he agreed that others should be married
We can never overemphasize a truth just because we feel that way, nor can we shut our mouth to a truth just because we feel differently
If others listen to us when our way is crooked and we are not clear about God's will, we are truly the blind leading the blind
Not only will the blind who follow us fall into the pit, but both who are blind, ourselves and our followers, will fall into the pit
If we become teachers to many, instructing them to do this and that, there is the danger that both we and they will end up in the pit
Even when we are one hundred twenty percent sure of something, we should only say it with seventy to eighty percent assurance
We must learn to not lead others by the hand, learn to not force others to go our way, and learn to not impose obedience to God upon others
A subjective person always considers himself to be the head, and he always wants to assume leadership over others
A man who is dealt with by the Lord is always faithful and always willing to speak, yet he will never try to impose his will upon others
May we all be pliable, always giving others the freedom to choose and always asking others what they would like to do
If a man's subjectivity is dealt with by the Lord, he will show a marked difference in the numerous small actions of his daily life
When a young worker of the Lord is put together with a few other brothers you will immediately know whether or not he is a subjective person
As soon as there are two persons, you will see that the one who is subjective always will try to be on top of the other
He will want to have a say in what to eat and what not to eat, what to wear and what not to wear, where to sleep and where not to sleep
A man can only be broad and generous after he has been dealt with by the Lord and his subjectivity has been removed
A subjective person always tries to take things in his hand; he wants to establish himself as the leader among God's people
Not only is he dull to learning and unfit for God's commissioning; his total energy is spent on his own subjectivity
When a man interferes with others' affairs, he becomes negligent of his own work, because other things fully occupy him
We have to pray for Gods breaking work praying that we will not be subjective in any way whether towards others or towards our own affairs
Some people may be sharper than others, but a subjective person is always opinionated, full of methods, and ready to take control of others
We have to allow the Lord to deal with us in a severe way at least once so that we can be crushed to the ground and never rise again
We should be strong in our ministry but at the same time we should learn to be meek and not subjective before the Lord
If we are bound and controlled by mammon it will be impossible for us to help the brothers and sisters to be free of its control and bondage
In the Old Testament there is the history of Balaam, and in the New Testament there is the way and teaching of Balaam
Because he coveted Balak's promise, a promise to satisfy all of his wants, he went to God again and again to ask for permission
If another place is rich in support, he will spontaneously be drawn to their support, and he will think that God is leading him there
Many poor places are short of care, yet so many workers are frequenting big places which are already crowded with people
If a worker cannot be freed from money and its influence, he cannot be a minister of God; his way will surely be Balaam's way
If a man is not fully delivered from money, he may be deep in money's bondage when he says that he is under God's leading
Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness'
Balaam did not accept Balak's offer as a result of one thought of covetousness; it was the result of habitual coveting
Otherwise, we outwardly may be seeking for leading, praying for guidance, and pursuing God's will while our feet remain on the wrong path
If a man's course of action is swayed and turned by the power of money, this man is a false prophet and a false teacher
Those who are governed by the supply of money in their pathway and their speaking should be cut off from God's work
It is interesting to note that in church history all the heretical teachers, those who taught differently, took godliness as a means of gain
Brothers and sisters, if you want to work for the Lord, your mind must be completely free from the influence of money
Brothers and sisters, we can sell our clothing and our possessions, but we can never sell our truth and our godliness
Unless we die to mammon and our mind is completely free from it, it is better not to touch the Lord's work at all
When we have godliness, we ask for nothing more, we expect nothing more, and we are satisfied with what we have
Those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin
Luke 9 records His sending forth of the twelve disciples, and chapter ten records His sending forth of the seventy
The point to emphasize is that in carrying out his commission for the Lord, a worker should not pay attention to his wallet
For an ordinary journey, one needs a purse to hold his money, a staff for walking, and two tunics to change his clothes
Why did He say that these are unnecessary when He sent out the twelve disciples in chapter nine and the seventy in chapter ten?
The Lord said, 'As many as do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them'
We can find out more about the Lord's training of His disciples in the feeding of the five thousand and then the four thousand
On one of these occasions, He took His disciples with Him and preached to a large crowd of five thousand, not including women and children
Toward the close of the day the disciples came to Him and said, 'This place is deserted and the hour is already late
Brothers and sisters, all those who are counting their two hundred denarii are not qualified to work for the Lord
They brought Him the seven loaves and the few fish, and the Lord performed another miracle and fed the four thousand
To Judas, three hundred denarii was enough to betray a man he sold the Lord Jesus for a price of three hundred denarii
A brother once said, 'If a new believer tries to take the moderate way once he believes, he will have no spiritual future at all'
Brothers and sisters, considerations of moderation can wait ten or twenty years, but when one first believes, he should waste himself on Him
Of course Paul accepted gifts from others, but that had to do with another subject the responsibility of the giver
He said that he announced the gospel of God to them free of charge, that he was not a burden to them, not even when he lacked
If we are criticized for receiving any gift from anyone, we have lost our dignity as servants of the Lord altogether
Paul told us not only how he maintained his integrity, but also how he worked with his two hands to supply the needs of his co-workers
If we keep all that we have received and only make provisions for ourselves, we do not know the meaning of the work of a minister
It is true that the Levites had no inheritance in all the cities; they sojourned among the twelve tribes and lived by the altar
If our eyes are always on our own needs, we will end up in financial straits and will not be able to supply the needs of our co-workers
Often when we are in lack, we should give more, for as soon as the money that we have goes, the Lord's supply comes
He continued in the same verse, saying, 'For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children'
Paul would still have spoken to the Ephesians or the Philippians, but he would not have spoken to the Corinthians
He showed them that God could use their money, but that he himself would not; he did not want anything from them
Brothers and sisters, can we differentiate between them and theirs whenever we communicate with others in the church?
If they have a problem with us and we cannot gain their hearts, will we still support them, edify them, and pray for their growth?
Paul had plenty of reasons to turn away from the Corinthians, but he came to them again and again, and even a third time
If our money does go into our preaching, we are doing the right thing and are putting our money into a worthy cause
When some criticized him and looked for opportunity to slander him in Achaia and Corinth, he refused their gift
We can accept gifts from some places like Macedonia, and we should refuse gifts from other places that say things about us
If someone is speaking behind our backs or if someone is seeking for an opportunity to criticize us, we simply cannot accept their gifts
Let us turn to Paul's letter to the Philippians to see his attitude in receiving offerings from the saints there
He told the only church that was supporting him that he was full, that he was abounding, and that he was filled
He had enough; his only hope was that their gift would become 'a sweet-smelling savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God'
They offered up the money as a sacrifice to God; it was not for Paul personally, and it had nothing to do with him
At the same time, he blessed them: 'My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus'
Finally, let us consider Paul's attitude in relation to funds that the church passed through his hands and which others wanted him to manage
After they heard it, they went beyond their ability in the depth of their poverty and affliction to care for the brothers in Jerusalem
They did not care if they were in poverty and affliction themselves; they still wanted to have a share in this work
It was true that the brothers in Jerusalem were in need, but it was not simply a matter of getting money and forwarding it to the saints
For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men
He said, 'Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us'
He said, 'For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men'
If we do not settle this issue, we cannot deal with other issues, and we will surely face problems and troubles down the road
Many brothers and sisters are not absolute to the truth; they are affected by people, things, and personal feelings
If a man is not absolute to the truth, he will, in the course of his work, sacrifice God's truth for man, himself, or his own desires
The problems with many workers stem from the relationship with their friends, intimate acquaintances, and family
If the truth is the truth, it should not be compromised, whether by our own brothers, our relatives, or our intimate friends
The problem is that the coworker presumes that his son is qualified for baptism and in so doing he sacrifices the absoluteness of the truth
Being absolute to the truth means that no personal feelings or family relationships are allowed to stand in the way of the truth
If the brother's separation of himself was right, he should have done so even if he had been informed of the matter
If the brother's separation of himself was wrong, he should not have done so even when he was not informed of the matter
If it was wrong for him to separate himself, he should not make an excuse of not receiving an answer to his question
If having separate tables is according to the truth, there should be separate tables, even if the brothers are attached to one another
If having separate tables is not according to the truth, there should not be separate tables, even if there are offenses
Whether or not we like what is happening and whether or not we feel hurt about something have nothing to do with the issue
When we stand beside Gods truth we should not just consider ourselves to be smaller than it we should consider ourselves to be nonexistent
A brother, who had been criticized in some quarters, came to the church and felt quite happy about the contacts he made
He felt that he had been unjustly criticized where he had been, but he did not really touch the truth before the Lord
When the new brother heard this, he left, remarking in anger, 'No wonder so many people are against this church
If the way we take is right, it is always right; it does not become right because this brother is taking this way
If the justification of a place is dependent on its treatment of him, he must be the most important thing in the whole world!
If truth dictates that we should not separate, we cannot separate even if we are arguing with each other and irritating each other every day
If we all see the absoluteness of the truth we will care for one thing only whether or not something is according to Gods will and decision
When something comes up, we will consider Brother Wang's reaction, Brother Chow's thought, and Brother Liu's action
If a company of men would only care for God's truth and would reject human methods altogether, that would be a blessed body of men indeed
If we are able to take the absolute way of truth among the co-workers, we will be able to say what we should say and do what we should do
Let us remember that there is no place whatsoever for personal feelings and sentiments in the work of the Lord
Even if our personal sentiments can positively influence others to receive the truth, we should still keep them out of the work
Out of the goodness of our hearts we may want to do something to uphold the truth, but truth requires no human hand to uphold it
We only need to learn to honor God's truth, to take the way of the truth, and to not compromise the truth in any way
He said, 'No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses'
Trophimuss illness did not go away Timothys illness did not go away and the thorn in Pauls flesh remained their illnesses were not healed
Brothers and sisters, it takes ten or twenty years of training in God's hand before a man can become somewhat useful to Him
If we want to run a good race and be somewhat mature in the Lord, we need at least ten or twenty years of training
The Lord may have more crosses for us, and His intention may be for us to become more useful in our latter years
Of the six hundred thousand souls among the Israelites, only two entered Canaan alive , and two others entered Canaan dead
What a pity it is when the body becomes corrupt before the work ever begins, or when a person dies before he has ever become useful!
In taking care of our health, there are many necessary precautions we have to take, many necessary things we have to pay attention to
If at all possible, we should learn to take care of our bodies and should not be loose or careless about our own health
We should eat foods that have a high nutritional value and should eat less or nothing at all of those that have little nutritional value
Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to trust in the Lord regarding our body, yet at the same time we have to follow natural laws and rest
Another advantage for having a wide variety in our diet is that we are not inconvenienced in any way when we are sent out in the work
Those who cannot accommodate a wide variety of food will not be able to tolerate many things when they are in the field
Once a believer asked another believer on a ship, 'Why did the Lord Jesus give loaves and fishes to the multitude'?
On the other hand, when we do not have a specific charge from the Lord, we should take good care of our own body
If they are put in a situation where they cannot live according to their habitual ways, they will not be able to function
If he is a cold person and he can only work among cold ones rather than among warm ones, he is disqualified from the work
Some brothers can only minister to older ones; they have nothing to say when they are among children or younger ones
Madam Guyon once said that a man in total union with God is able to be a counsel to the old man and a friend to a child
May we all learn to be dealt with by the Lord so that our daily habits and personality will not become rigid and unchangeable
A worker of the Lord must also have a proper view and suitable resolution concerning the matter of virginity and marriage
Then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better
If a man thinks that it is wrong to remain a virgin, and that the bloom of youth is past, and it must be so, he can act as he pleases
Let us read again Matthew 191012 His disciples said to Him If the case of the man with his wife is like this it is not profitable to marry
He who can accept it, let him accept it,' it will become clear to us that virginity is given to those who can accept it
In order to avoid distraction and have adequate time to serve the Lord with diligence, it is better to remain single
Paul made this very clear in 1 Corinthians 7:1-9: 'Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman
On the other hand, we have to maintain the balance in God's Word; we cannot say that marriage is something unclean
If a worker of the Lord is married, he should do his best to settle his family matters in such a way that he will have the least distraction
A worker of the Lord cannot lightly pass on the spiritual problems of other brothers and sisters to his family
If his family members want to know anything, they should find out the same way that all the other brothers and sisters find out
Another point we should take note of is to maintain a proper relationship in our contact between the brothers and the sisters
In chapter three the Lord received Nicodemus at night, while in chapter four He met the Samaritan woman during the day
In chapter three the Lord received Nicodemus in a house, and in chapter four He met the woman at the public well
It is clear that the Lord spoke with Nicodemus under very different circumstances than those under which He spoke to the Samaritan woman
If a brother has a habit or preference to talk to sisters, or vice versa, we should deal with this situation immediately
If anyone goes beyond the proper boundary and engages in abnormal fellowship, we should deal with the situation in a strict way
