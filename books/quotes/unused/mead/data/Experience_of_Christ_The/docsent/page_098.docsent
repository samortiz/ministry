   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO PERSECUTE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to experience Christ, in this sense we need to persecute Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When some hear such a word, they may say, "It is heresy to say that we, the lovers of Christ, should persecute Him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yes, we need to persecute Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should say, "Lord Jesus, I don't care whether You are willing or unwilling, You must be for me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if You say that You are not ready for me to experience You, I shall persecute You to make You ready."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When this is viewed in a positive sense, it is not too much of an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mary Magdalene was an example of one who persecuted the Lord Jesus in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection, she pursued Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She persecuted the resurrected Christ and persuaded Him to do something that He was not willing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to seek the Lord in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FORGETTING THE THINGS BEHIND</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you ever persecuted the Lord Jesus in a positive way?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Probably not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever sought the Lord by persecuting Him until He goes along with you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you persecute Him in such a positive way, you will forget the things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only those who are lukewarm, who are neither cold nor hot in loving the Lord, consider the things of the past and remember their experiences of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when you persecute the Lord, you have no time to think about the past.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the best way to forget the past is to be fully occupied with pursuing the Lord right now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not occupied in this way, we shall be continually occupied with the things of the past, either positive things or negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be busy with pursuing Christ and persecuting Him in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you get into the spirit of Paul, you will realize how busy he was in persecuting Jesus and in compelling Him to be his enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no room in his mind for considerations about the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To repeat, to consider the past is a sign of being lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when you are burning and are persecuting the Lord Jesus in a positive way, you have no room in your mind to think of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, you are occupied with pursuing toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE GOAL AND THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both the goal and the prize are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is within us, but He is also before us at the end of the race as the goal that we are striving to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To say that Christ is the goal means that He is the highest enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christ who is in us for our enjoyment today is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The goal is the highest enjoyment of Christ, that is, the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter how much we experience Christ today, we have not yet reached the goal of the highest enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This experience of Christ is still before us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as we reach the goal, the goal will immediately become the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you obtain the prize, you may shout with the enjoyment of the highest experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, you will have the out-resurrection as the top enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the enjoyment is Christ, the experience is Christ, the goal is Christ, and the prize is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the enjoyment within us, and Christ is the goal set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pursue toward the goal so that we may gain the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To pursue Christ in this way we need to be aggressive and to exercise ourselves very much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No lazy person can be a persecutor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every persecutor of Christ has a strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I say again that we all must pursue Christ in a persecuting way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to pray, "Lord Jesus, I intend to persecute You.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All day long I shall be Your persecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will compel You to be for me and to be my experience."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Have you ever prayed in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to pray like this, telling the Lord that we shall persecute Him until He becomes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do this, eventually we shall arrive at the goal and receive the prize.</S>
