        <h2 class="head1"> EVERY PART OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING AN ISSUE OF THE GRACE<br />
IN THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Every part of the organic Body of Christ is an issue of the grace in the economy of God. Grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;as the enjoyment of life, and the life of God is with God the Father as the substance, God the Son as the element, and God the Spirit as the essence.</p>
<p>Christ, the last Adam, after passing through an all-inclusive death, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection as the essence of the Divine Trinity to come into us to be our life and everything. Day by day we need to be filled with Him, saturated with Him, permeated by Him, infused by Him, and transfused by Him. Hence, as we read the New Testament, we cannot avoid the word <em>Spirit.</em> Especially in the Epistles, the emphasis is on the Spirit, and the Spirit is frequently linked with grace. (<em>The Law and Grace of God in His Economy,</em> pp. 67, 68)</p>
<h2 class="head1">AS THE SPIRIT OF THE ONENESS<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST,<br />
BEING THE ESSENCE OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, being the essence of the Body, which is constituted with Christ as the element, out from the origin of God the Father, to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 4:3-6). Christ is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence. This element is out from the origin of God the Father. Thus, with the Body of Christ, the Father is the origin, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. This is the Triune God&mdash;the origin, the element, and the essence. These three are blended and mingled with the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ, the church, is four-in-one: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body. Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God the Father. In the Body the Spirit is the essence. The essence needs the element, which is the Lord Christ. The element must have an origin, a source, which is the Father. The Father is the source, the origin. Out of the Father there is the element, and within the element there is the essence. God is the origin, the Son is the element, the Spirit is the essence, and the Body is the very constitution. These are four-in-one. However, only the first three are worthy of our worship; the fourth, the Body, should not be deified as an object of worship.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the oneness of the Body of Christ is the essence of the Body to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing. Today something is going on to mingle the Father as the origin, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence with the Body. This mingling is continuing today and will be consummated. The Spirit is the essence of the Body to consummate this mingling. (<em>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation,</em> pp. 127-128)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>Paul was martyred soon after he wrote the book of Ephesians. After approximately twenty-five years, among the apostles of the first generation, only the aged John was still alive. He was the last one to pass away among the twelve apostles. In writing the book of Revelation, he points out at the beginning that the church in each locality is a golden lampstand, that each lampstand bears not one lamp but seven lamps, and that within the lamps there is the shining light. In figure, the golden lampstand signifies the embodiment of the Triune God. First, the nature of the golden lampstand is pure gold, and in typology gold signifies the Father&rsquo;s glorious nature and life. Next, the golden lampstand is not simply a piece of solid gold. Rather, the gold is beaten into the shape of the lampstand. This signifies that Christ as the embodiment of God the Father became a man and passed through sufferings and trials for the expression of God. Moreover, each lampstand bears seven lamps. Revelation tells us clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (4:5). Therefore, in Revelation the golden lampstand signifies the church as the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That the church is the embodiment of the Triune God corresponds with Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. This indicates that the church is the mingling of the Triune God with the Body. This corresponds with the golden lampstands in Revelation. The church is the Triune God completely mingled with His redeemed people as one to become a golden lampstand shining locally to express God Himself. When this expression is manifested, it is the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9).</p>
<p>At the end of Revelation, when the new heaven and the new earth come, their center is a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem. Upon this mountain is the throne of God, on which are God and the Lamb, Christ. God is the light and Christ is the lamp (21:23). Hence, the New Jerusalem is a lampstand. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem is an aggregate lampstand with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining out from the golden mountain. This is the ultimate consummation of the church. At the beginning of Revelation, the church is expressed as many lampstands in different localities, with one lampstand for each locality. At the consummation of the church in its manifestation in eternity, all the lampstands are gathered together as the unique, universal lampstand, the New Jerusalem. (<em>The Four Crucial Elements of the Bible&mdash;Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church,</em> pp. 140-141)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Do not forget the word <em>is</em> in Ephesians 1:23: &ldquo;[The church] <em>is</em> His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; This means that the church <em>is</em> the Body, and the Body <em>is</em> the fullness. These two levels of &ldquo;is&rdquo; are in succession rather than in parallel. It is not that on the one hand the church is the Body, while on the other hand the church is the fullness. Rather, it is that the church is the Body, and the Body is the fullness. According to doctrine, the fullness equals the Body, and the Body equals the church. But according to reality, a man can be in the church and still not live in the Body. All the brothers and sisters who meet in Hong Kong are in the church, but who is living in the Body? This becomes a big question mark. Strictly speaking, that which can fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is not the church in name but the Body. The Body is the fullness of Christ. I repeat that if you look from this angle and measure with this yardstick, you will see that today on earth in the churches there is not much of the element of the Body. (<em>One Body, One Spirit, and One New Man,</em> p. 36)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
