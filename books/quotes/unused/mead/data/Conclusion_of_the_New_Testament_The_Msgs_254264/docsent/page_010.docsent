   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Seen from Afar, Longed after, and Waited for by the Old Testament Saints</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The city of the living God was seen from afar, longed after, and waited for by the Old Testament saints Heb 11:13b, 16a, 10a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking of Abraham and the other patriarchs, Hebrews 11:13 says, "All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar and greeted them, and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word translated "sojourners" may also be rendered "pilgrims," "exiles," "expatriates."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abraham was the first Hebrew Gen 14:13 , a river crosser, leaving Chaldea, the idolatrous land of curse, crossing the river Josh 24:2-3 , and coming to Canaan, the good land of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, he did not settle there but sojourned in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile and an expatriate, longing after a better country, a heavenly one Heb 11:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps, living on earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the God-built city of foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In eternity past the Triune God made a plan, and throughout the centuries He has been carrying out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Son came through incarnation, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was resurrected, and then ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since His ascension, the Spirit has been working out many wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely, as the conclusion of all this, God will not build a material city for His redeemed people to live in. The New Jerusalem is a city, but it is not a physical, material city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, some believers still insist that the New Jerusalem is a material city built of actual gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who hold this concept need to consider Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this chapter Paul says that he laid Christ as the unique foundation, and then he charges us to take heed how we build on this foundation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should build not with wood, grass, and stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this age, the church age, we should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the coming age, silver becomes pearl, and the materials in the New Jerusalem become gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we should be building the church with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This, of course, does not mean that we build with literal gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are not physical materials; they are signs signifying various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of the Father with all its attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Silver signifies the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The precious stones signify the transforming work of the Holy Spirit with all its attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these materials, therefore, are the products of our experience and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As signs, these materials signify the divine work of the Divine Trinity who is wrought into our being through His divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are now building the church with God the Father's nature, with God the Son's redemption, and with God the Spirit's transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle is the same with the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the building in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 3 the building is in process and has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 is the consummation of that building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the city for which Abraham was waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was waiting not for a material city but for a marvelous city built with the Father's nature, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament Believers Having Come to Her</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Testament believers have already come to the city of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 12:22a says, "You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem," referring to God's habitation and the center of His universal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 11:14-16 reveals that the Old Testament saints longed after a better country, a heavenly country, and that God has prepared for them a city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse does not say that we will come to the heavenly Jerusalem but that we have come to this city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Mount Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem in 12:22 were material, how could we have come to them today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that, according to Hebrews 12:22, we have already come to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, indicates that it is not a material city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we need to realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the church is God's home, and it is also our home today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the church is enlarged to be a city, it becomes a heavenly country.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our heavenly country is a city the heavenly Jerusalem to which we have already come.</S>
