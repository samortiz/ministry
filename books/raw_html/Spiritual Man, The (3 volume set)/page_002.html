<H1 CLASS=TITLE>INTRODUCTION</H1><P>This book is divided into three volumes with ten sections. The writing of the book began in the latter part of 1925 and was completed in June 1927.</P><P>The following explanation by the author himself on the nature of the book is quoted from an announcement in Issue No. 3 of The Present Testimony:</P><P>"This book puts particular emphasis on spiritual reality. Hence, what is covered in each volume can all be attested in experience; nothing is there as an empty word.</P><P>"The most frustrating experience of believers today is that in seeking for progress on the spiritual path, they do not find the proper way. As a result, they grope in darkness, being at times high or low, lingering around the crossroads year in and year out, and having no one to consult for direction. The author of this book was such a one. For this reason, the book emphasizes clear guidance on the proper path. Every chapter of this book is for the purpose of directing the believers on the right course. Therefore, all those who seek after God with an honest heart can go step by step accordingly. Almost every chapter begins from the position of the sinner and goes on step by step toward the peak of spiritual life.</P><P>"The whole book covers a wide scope; every question concerning the spiritual life that the believers want to know but cannot answer is explained here. For example, difficult matters such as hearing God's voice and understanding God's will are all clearly explained. After reading this book, all major spiritual problems will be fully resolved.</P><P>"Regeneration, salvation, sanctification, denying the self, the filling of the Holy Spirit and power, the baptism of the Spirit, fellowship, prayer, Bible study identification in death, the flesh, the soulish life, the emotion, supernatural experiences, miracles, the discernment of true and false speaking in tongues, the intuition, the conscience, revelation of God, spiritual work, warfare with Satan, the evil spirits, demon possession, the free will, the renewing of the mind, passivity, consecration, affection, the feeling of coldness and hotness, the body, illness, the way to escape death, and countless other subjects are explained in the deepest as well as the simplest way.</P><P>"If a believer wants to walk on the proper spiritual course, he must read this book. If anyone wants to help others and explain to others their true condition, he also cannot skip this book.</P><P>"All who read this book will find light even on many ordinarily overlooked topics. Even a matter as familiar as regeneration will be understood in a way that was unthought of before."</P>
