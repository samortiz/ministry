   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EMPOWERING AND STRENGTHENING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THOSE WHO WAIT ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fifth aspect of the glad tidings in Isaiah 40 is that Jehovah the Savior empowers and strengthens those who wait on Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We experience this when we prophesy, when we speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we prophesy, we are empowered and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord gives power to the faint, and to those who have no vigor He multiplies strength v. 29 . In Ephesians 6:10 Paul said, "Be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength." He also declared, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 . Christ is the empowering One, so we who wait on Him will not faint or become weary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ as the empowering One, we will mount up with wings like eagles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 40:30 and 31 say, "Although youths will faint and become weary, / And young men shall collapse exhausted; / Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not faint; / They will walk and will not become weary."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the Old Testament way of describing those who trust in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament expresses this in Ephesians 6:10 and Philippians 4:13.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul also says in Philippians 4:12, "I have learned the secret."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He learned the secret of sufficiency in Christ, so he did not faint or become weary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of his life, in 2 Timothy 4:7, he declared, "I have finished the course."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 40 presents a marvelous picture of the all-inclusive Christ as Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through His living and abiding word, we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been fed by Him to know Him as the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is unlimited, unsearchable, incomparable, and high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We human beings are as a drop of water and specks of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are nothing and even less than nothing, vanity, emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we know Christ in this way, we are qualified to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are nothing, and He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we do not have any trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We put our trust in Him and wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He then gives us the eagles' wings to mount up, so that we can run the course of the Christian life without fainting or becoming weary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the very Christ presented to us in Isaiah 40.</S>
