   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 28:19 also shows us that when we go to disciple others, we need to have the realization that we are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We not only have the authority of Jesus but also are one with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not going to teach others some religion.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the grammatical construction of Matthew 28:19, to disciple the nations is by baptizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to baptize them into something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To baptize is to dip.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I baptize my eyeglasses, this means I dip them into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, if I am going to baptize someone, this means I am going to put him into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we baptize others, we put them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To disciple the nations is to baptize them into God, to put them into God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are going to put others into God, you surely need to be in God first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then you can tell others that you are in the Triune God and that you want to put them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You could say, "I have no intention to put you into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have no intention to put you into any denomination, any sect, or any group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My intention is to put you into the Triune God, in whom I am.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am in the Triune God, and I am going to put you into the Triune God, in whom I am."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is different from the preaching of the gospel in a low way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You need to have the realization and the assurance that you are putting people into God, because you are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>HAVING POWER TO PREACH THE HIGH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need power to preach the high gospel.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And in Acts 1:8 He said, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the power from on high comes upon us, we will be qualified and equipped for witnessing unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you mean business with the Lord, and if today you are high on the top of a mountain, realizing that all authority is His and that you are really in the Triune God, then you already have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You just need to claim it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you go to the young people, you have to tell the universe, "I have the power!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should have this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not care for your feeling or for your experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to care for the Word of God.</S>
