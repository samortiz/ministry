        <h2 class="head2">The Inclination toward Being Spiritual</h2>
<p>In order to be coordinated and joined together with the saints in the church, we also need to learn to deal with the inclination to be spiritual. Some serving ones enjoy being around spiritual persons but show no interest in immature or fleshly saints. Although being fleshly is indeed hateful, the fleshly saints are still members of the Body of Christ; hence, we need to love them. A person&rsquo;s spirituality is a test to us that proves whether we have learned the lesson of building up. The spiritual brothers are lovable, but the weaker brothers deserve more of our love. A parent&rsquo;s heart often goes first to the children with shortcomings or problems. The more problems a child has, the more his parents care for him. The more rebellious a child is, the more his parents care for him. This is the heart of a parent. In 1 Corinthians 12:24 Paul says, &ldquo;Our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; This verse shows that the Lord cares for the immature, weak, and uncomely members more than for the comely ones.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s spirituality and ability to fellowship and pray with us are a serious test. If we can love only spiritual believers, our joining with the members of the Body of Christ is problematic, and it will be hard for our function to be manifested. Proper spirituality does not cause a person to be more individualistic or isolated, nor does it cause him to compare himself with Moses on Mount Sinai or the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane. Proper spirituality will not cause a person to think that he is higher than everyone else and hence has no choice but to live alone before God.</p>
<p>On the contrary, proper spirituality prevents a person from living in isolation and from caring only for himself. It causes him to willingly contact the weak, care for the stumbled, seek the backslidden, carry the immobile, and love the unlovable and those with problems. If we are truly broken, the inclination toward spirituality will be discharged from our being, and we will be able to love those who do not live before God. We will be able to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit and still be able to love those who set their mind on the flesh. If we have learned such a lesson, we will be a fruitful branch that bears clusters of fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination Only to Read the Bible</h2>
<p>We need to learn to deal with the inclination only to read the Bible. Some serving ones are so passionate about reading and studying the Bible that they do not need to eat or sleep. They can drop everything else for the Bible. They do not care whether others love the Lord, are saved, fall, or stand. They care only to read the Bible. When such believers meet people, they can talk only about the Bible. When they read the Bible, they forget about heaven and earth. Although reading the Bible is a spiritual matter, this kind of Bible reading is a problem, a peculiarity. It shows that such believers are not yet broken and cannot be built up with other saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination Only to Pray</h2>
<p>We need to deal with an inclination only to pray. Believers with this obsession cannot do anything without prayer. The Bible tells us to &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), but we cannot drop everything else and focus only on prayer if we want to be built up with others in the church life. Suppose a saint is gravely ill in the hospital, and his family asks us to visit him. Should we say, &ldquo;Let us pray first to see if the Lord wants us to go&rdquo;? It might already be too late by the time we finish praying. If there are people in difficulty who need our support, it is not right for us to insist on praying before assisting them. This is an example of turning prayer into an obsession.</p>
<p>A farmer who prays throughout the year but does not sow, cultivate and fertilize the land, or water the plants cannot reap a harvest. It is God who causes the growth of the harvest, but He requires people to carry out outward activities such as cultivating and fertilizing. In the church some saints focus only on prayer and despise other services as being the work of Martha. When such saints visit the needy or fellowship, they will encourage others only to pray and trust in the Lord. It seems as though they do not live on earth. They are fully ignorant of the needs of the saints. Hence, they cannot be joined or built up with others. This indicates that they have not been adequately broken.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED IN LOVE</h2>
<p>A broken person can easily be built up with others. Even though two disciples went down to Emmaus after the Lord was crucified and resurrected, the Lord Jesus still walked with them (Luke 24:13-15). It was wrong for them to go down to Emmaus, but the Lord Jesus walked with them. The ability to love people with different origins, languages, and accents, people who are not spiritual, who rarely read the Bible or pray, who are worldly, and who do not know how to trust in God requires that we be broken. We love them because they are children of God. A broken person can be joined with the saints who are weak or strong, inexperienced or experienced, and falling or standing. This is not socializing but being joined in life. When we love others in such a way and are joined with them, we will immediately manifest our function, and we will also bear clusters of fruit and take care of many saints. This is the love spoken of in the Bible. This love is out from God, and it is the love of God.</p>
<p>God not only loves those who are like Him; He also loves those who are not like Him, those who are far below the standard. He loves those who fail, fall, are backslidden, are weak, and even commit sins. The Bible charges us to love one another even as the Lord has loved us (John 15:12). The Lord loves us, not because we are like Him; He loves us even though we are absolutely not like Him. He wants us to love others with His love, to love those who are worse than us and who are backslidden or weak.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not fellowship merely with those who suit our taste and ignore those who do not. Frankly speaking, those who need the most fellowship are the ones who are fallen, backslidden, and stumbled. If we do not fellowship with those who need fellowship, there is something wrong with our love. This means that our love is a human love that will not bear fruit; our love is not the divine love. If we can love those who are unlovable, who are worse than us, and who are stumbled, we will bear many saints, and there will be clusters of fruit hanging on us. This is our function.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
