   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is still the best seller.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is translated into more languages than any other book written by man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>More than six hundred million Bibles were sent out in 1989.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is most definitely the precious gift of God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God did not write a book in heaven and send it down by an angel to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not just inspire one well-known man of God to write a book for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, there was the speaking of God to many godly men for nearly 2,500 years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then Moses took the lead to write down God s revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After having been written by more than forty men over a period of 1,600 years, and after having been tested by being read and experienced by God s people for over one thousand years, the final sixty-six books were at last canonized to be the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But shortly thereafter, the Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many faithful believers were put to death for having the Bible in their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a thousand years, Martin Luther and his co-workers liberated the Bible from the unlawful custody of the Roman Catholic Church and made it available to the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, most people received very little revelation in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, after another five hundred years of extensive study and research, most of the Bible has been opened to us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We did not receive all the revelations direct from God, but gathered many of them from an accumulation of revelations recorded over the past six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we have in the recovery today is the cream of the revelation of God and the rich experiences of the saints and the churches throughout church history.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should treasure the Bible and all the recovery books that unveil the Bible to us!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How much we need to study the Word with the help of the ministry!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Lord Jesus, I want to give myself to devour Your Word until I am full of You and come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Questions and Exercises What is the difference between a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the difference between the new testament and the old testament?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Which one is better?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the Apocrypha?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do we prove that the Apocrypha does not belong in the Bible and was not there in the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are some of the false revelations?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Briefly trace the history of the translations of the Bible up to its first English version.</S>
