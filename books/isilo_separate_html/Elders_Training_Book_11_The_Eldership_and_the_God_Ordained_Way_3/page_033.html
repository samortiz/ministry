The elders' spiritual responsibility in a church is firstly to bear fruit, to preach the gospel to gain sinners. In the New Testament, the preaching of the gospel is given a high place. The first thing a local church should do, the first responsibility it should bear, is to disciple the nations, to preach the gospel, to gain sinners. The elders as the leading ones should take the lead to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16).</P><P>In the New Testament, the sequence of the divine economy is very meaningful. Even before the Lord Jesus presented Himself to the public, John the Baptist preached the gospel. According to his birth, John should have been a priest, doing the priestly work, eating the priestly food, wearing the priestly garments, and living a priestly life. However, he did not do this. He left his home and the Old Testament priesthood. He lived in the wilderness, ate wild things, and wore a garment of camel's hair. He did not do anything related to the Old Testament priesthood. Rather, he preached the gospel (Matt. 3:1-2) to gain sinners, offering them as sacrifices to God. His father, as an Old Testament priest, made many offerings as types of Christ, but John did a new thing, offering repenting sinners to be the members of Christ that God in His economy might have the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>After this, the Lord Jesus came and repeated what John had preached (Matt. 4:17). Then He appointed the apostles and sent them out to preach the gospel (10:1-7). After His resurrection, He charged His disciples, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations" (28:18-19). To disciple the nations is to preach the gospel with authority. It is to disciple, teach, and instruct the nations to be God's people in His kingdom.</P><P>On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was poured out and the church was established, the first thing the disciples did was to preach the gospel (Acts 2:4, 14). We may think that it is first necessary to build up a church before the members can spread the gospel. However, the history of the church was not in this manner. The Holy Spirit did not wait for the church to be built up. Instead, a persecution was raised up against the whole church in Jerusalem, and most of the disciples were scattered to preach the gospel. Only a few were left in Jerusalem to take care of the church there.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
