         <h2 class="head1">CHRIST FILLING ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Seventh, Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is &ldquo;the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Christ fills all in all in order to be the content of all things and to be in all things. The point of Christ&rsquo;s filling all in all is not easy to understand, and it is also very difficult to explain thoroughly. However, we can mention a few points.</p>
<p>The first point is that even if we cannot fully understand all the spiritual things in the universe, we should believe what is spoken of in God&rsquo;s Word. For example, the Word speaks of God and of God being Spirit (John 4:24). Although God is invisible, we cannot deny His existence simply because we cannot see Him. Christians know that God is invisible and that the Spirit is intangible, but we also know that God exists. Although the Bible reveals that God created us in order to be related to us, the Bible does not tell us everything that pertains to God. Hence, it is impossible for us to comprehend everything in the universe based on our limited understanding. Even if there are certain spiritual matters in the universe that we do not understand, we should believe and receive them according to the word in the Bible. Although we may not have a clear sense or understanding of the Lord filling all in all, we should not deny this truth, because it is revealed in the Bible. We may not understand today, but one day we will understand that all things in the universe have the element of Christ. Christ is in all things.</p>
<p>The second point is that the Bible tells us that all things are created by Christ, that all things exist through Christ, and that all things are upheld and borne by Him (Heb. 1:3). All these points are related to Christ filling all in all. Christ filling all in all means that He created all things, that He causes all things to exist, and that He upholds and bears all things.</p>
<p>The third point is that in the universe and in all things, there are forces, theories, laws, and phenomena, all of which are very profound and which even physicists with great intelligence cannot fully explain. Nevertheless, all these things symbolize Christ. The Bible says clearly that the Lord is our power (Phil. 4:13; 2 Tim. 1:7; 4:17) and that the Lord is our light (John 1:4; 8:12). The Bible also says that the Lord is our law, which can be illustrated by the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2. However, it is not so easy to point out a theory or a phenomenon in the Bible. We can deduce from the Bible that, at the very least, these forces, theories, laws, and phenomena are symbols and depictions of Christ. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made.&rdquo; The eternal power of God is an aspect of the forces in the universe. Thus, these forces, theories, laws, and phenomena symbolize God and enable us to comprehend God in a limited way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we cannot fully understand how our Lord is the force in the universe. Perhaps in the coming glory we will understand how the Lord fills the forces, theories, laws, and phenomena in the universe. The Lord Jesus is the One who fills all and who is in all. Only when we enter into eternity will it even be possible for us to understand how Christ fills all in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS COHERING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Eighth, all things cohere in Christ. Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him.&rdquo; All things exist because they cohere in Christ. For example, all the spokes on a wheel are held together by the hub. If we take away the hub, the spokes would fall apart. This is the meaning of the word <em>cohere.</em> All things cohere in Christ; hence, if Christ were removed, all things would collapse and disintegrate. In 1933 Brother Nee mentioned this verse in a conference, saying that all things are &ldquo;unified&rdquo; in Christ. The entire universe coheres in Christ; in Christ there is cohering power.</p>
<p>According to astronomical studies, there is indeed an indescribable holding power in the universe. If we removed this holding power, the universe would collapse. Colossians 1:17 indicates that Christ is the central force holding all things together in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST UPHOLDING AND BEARING ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Ninth, Christ upholds and bears all things. Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord is &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power.&rdquo; While most people&rsquo;s understanding of this matter is limited, even a physicist or an astronomer cannot fully explain how all the stars and planets are upheld in the universe. All the galaxies in the universe have existed for billions of years, but scientists do not know why the universe exists or how it is held together. The Bible, however, clearly tells us that the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power. Furthermore, Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; In creation, God &ldquo;spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). Not only was the universe created by the Lord&rsquo;s word, but the universe itself coheres because the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS HAVING BEEN GIVEN TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>Tenth, all things have been given to Christ. John 3:35 and 13:3 speak of the Father giving all things into the hand of Christ. These verses may cause a person to ask, &ldquo;If all things were created by Christ, why is there a need to hand over all things to Him?&rdquo; This point requires some theological explanation. Although the Lord Jesus and God are one, as the Christ the Lord Jesus was also sent. The meaning of <em>Christ</em> is &ldquo;the anointed One,&rdquo; and in the Bible an anointed person is one who is commissioned and sent to accomplish a certain task. Christ was commissioned with the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will; He was sent to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan in the universe, including the creation of all things according to God&rsquo;s intention. God planned to create, and Christ created all things. When the work of creation was completed, the Father gave these things to Christ. Hence, Christ was given all things from the Father&rsquo;s hand. Christ&rsquo;s inheritance of all things is a matter of righteousness; He does not take anything by force. Hence, John 13:3 says, &ldquo;The Father had given all into His hands.&rdquo; The Father, as the source, gives all things to Christ, the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEIR OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Eleventh, Christ is the Heir of all things (Heb. 1:2). All things were created by Christ and are being upheld and borne by Him. God has given all things to Christ. Hence, Christ is the Heir of all things; all things are for Him. Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;All things have been created...unto Him.&rdquo; The word <em>unto</em> in this verse and the word <em>to</em> in Romans 11:36 are the same in Greek, meaning that all things are given to Him as an inheritance. Hence, Christ is Heir of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS BEING HEADED UP IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Lastly, all things will be headed up in Christ. Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; We need to consider the meaning of <em>head up,</em> which is related to the thought of gathering together. For example, forty people may be apart from one another even though they are each tied to a rope. If I gather all the people together by drawing all the ropes to me, they will be gathered to me and headed up by me. Similarly, when a person goes to the market to buy fish, he uses a rope to tie the fish together. When he picks up the rope, the fish are collected together by the rope. These are illustrations of the meaning of heading up in Greek. At the fullness of the times, God will head up all things in Christ.</p>
<p>All things were created by Christ, Christ is the Lord of all things, and all things have been given to Christ. Eventually, all things will be gathered together in Christ as the One who is the Head of all things. These twelve points concerning Christ and all things should be conveyed to the young people according to their level of understanding. The serving ones should consider and decide how to present these matters.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
