<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>6) The Separation of the Earth<br>from the Waters&#151;1:9-10</H2><P>After the second day, we have the third day&#151;the day of resurrection. On the third day, the day of resurrection, the dry land appeared under the expanse for generating life. This is the sixth requirement for generating life. In the whole Bible, the sea represents death and the earth represents Christ Himself. The Bible tells us that, eventually, after God has worked through many generations, the sea will be eliminated. After Satan's rebellion and God's judgment of the original creation, there was nearly nothing except waters. Then, God came in to restore by the brooding Spirit, the living Word, and the dividing light. On the second day, the expanse divided the waters, and on the third day God gathered the waters together under the expanse that the dry land might appear for producing life. This means that God had been working on the waters, seeking to confine and limit them. In Jeremiah 5:22 we are told that God drew a line to limit the sea. Today, God is still working to eliminate the sea because in it there are demons. The sea represents something demonic, something devilish. Eventually, when God's work is completed, there will be no more sea. In the new heavens and new earth there is only land, no sea (Rev. 21:1). The sea representing a main part of Satan's kingdom has been eliminated. Praise the Lord!</P><P>The dry land appeared in order to produce life, to generate life. On the third day, Christ came out of death. Christ came out of death in resurrection just to generate life. Hallelujah!</P><P>Although you may be saved, the darkness within has not been cleared up, the waters have not been divided and confined, and the things of death have not been limited. As you are going on with the Lord, the waters of death within you will gradually be confined, limited, and eliminated. Within you, the dry land will rise up. That is Christ. That is Christ in resurrection. First Peter 1:3 tells us that we have been regenerated by the resurrection of Christ. Without the resurrected Christ, there is no possibility for any life to be generated.</P><P>The land was separated from the waters. The land signifies life and the waters signify death. To divide the land from the waters means to separate life from death.</P><P>As we grow in the Lord, we learn how to discern light from darkness, separate heavenly things from earthly things, and divide life from death. In my speaking I may have nothing dark and nothing earthly; yet I speak without life. I am devoid of life. My speaking is genuine and proper, with nothing of darkness and nothing worldly, but nevertheless is full of death. So, I must pray, "Lord Jesus, drive away all the death waters within me that the dry land may appear to produce life." In my speaking there should be nothing of darkness, nothing of this earth, and nothing of death. Within my speaking there must be the dry land that produces life.</P><P>In your family life, there may be nothing of darkness, nothing worldly, but also nothing of life. When someone comes into your home, he cannot see anything dark or worldly; neither can he see anything living. All that he can see there is death. But I hope that when I come to see you, I will see that everything is full of life. Christ, the dry land, is appearing in your home. Christ is manifested, producing life in your home.</P><P>On the dry land there is no darkness and no waters of death. We just have the dry land filled with every kind of life. So, I say once again that what is revealed to us in Genesis is completely a matter of life.</P><P></P>
