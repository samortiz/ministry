[1]  Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are particular books.
[2]  D. The Sequence of the Five Books of Poetry
[3]  The sequence of the five books of poetry Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs in their spiritual significances is excellent and sweet.
[4]  Job stresses that God wants man to seek and gain God solely without any other blessings and prosperity, and that God wants man to seek Him for his perfection and not for his integrity.
[5]  Song of Songs stresses that Christ is the song of songs, the satisfaction of satisfactions to human life that is versus the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun.
[6]  If you are a person who loves the Lord and pursues Christ, not self-perfection, and who loves the Lord's word in the entire Bible and reads it with a praying spirit, not for the seeking of the doctrine of letters but for seeking the Spirit and word of life, not to get any help for self-cultivation but for the nourishment of your spirit that you may live a Christian life which is perfect not in human virtues but in the divine virtues which are the expressions of the divine attributes, then this book will render you nuggets and gems to strengthen your life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God's economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ.
[7]  FOR MAN TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Prov 1 9; 31
[8]  What the book of Proverbs is to us and what the entire Bible is to us depend on what kind of person we are.
[9]  The wise will inherit honor, but fools increase their own disgrace v. 35 .
[10]  Christ became wisdom to us from God in three vital things in God's salvation: righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18 ; sanctification for our present , by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life 6:19, 22 ; and redemption for our future , that is, the redemption of our body 8:23 , by which we will be transfigured in our body with the divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .
[11]  The writer says in 4:3 that he was a son to his father, tender and the only beloved in the sight of his mother.
[12]  In verses 10 through 13 he says, "Hear, my son, and receive my words,/And the years of your life will be many./I have taught you in the way of wisdom;/I have led you in the paths of uprightness./When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;/And when you run, you will not stumble./Take hold of instruction; do not let go;/Guard her, for she is your life."
[13]  In holding marriage in honor man's faithfulness is the base.
[14]  Verses 7 through 14 are a charge to young men to keep their way far from her and not to go near the door of her house; lest they give their honor to others, and their years to the cruel; lest strangers be filled with their wealth, and their labors go to the house of a foreigner, and they mourn at their end, when their flesh and body are consumed, and they say, "How I have hated instruction,/And my heart has despised reproof!/And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers/Nor inclined my ear to my instructors;/I was almost into every evil/In the midst of the congregation and assembly."
[15]  When we come not only to the Proverbs but to any book of the Bible, especially Ephesians, the most spiritual book, we must be persons who are right.
[16]  In reading the Bible, a right person is one who loves Christ, pursues after Him, and lives a life of denying himself and of being conformed to the death of Christ.
[17]  LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE FOUR TOUCHING THE WORD OF GOD BY OUR NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:22-24; 6:17-18
[18]  Ephesians 4:22-24 tells us clearly that a believer in Christ has two men the old man and the new man.
[19]  The old man is of Adam through our natural birth, and the new man is of Christ by a new birth, regeneration.
[20]  BY THE OLD MAN AND BY THE NEW MAN
[21]  My burden in these messages on Proverbs is to help you touch the Word of God by your new man, by exercising your spirit to pray-read.
[22]  We must learn to come to the Word of God as those who are approaching God, not to receive proverbs and teachings but to receive nourishment and enlightenment, so that we may know that, according to God, we should always be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 , which is the consummated Spirit, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ.
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE FIVE THE DETAILED PRECEPTS FOR MAN
[24]  LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE SIX COMING TO PROVERBS
[25]  TO CULTIVATE OUR REGENERATED NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:22-24; Gal 2:20; 2 Tim 3:16a; Eph 6:17-18a
[26]  Like a city that is broken down, without walls, is a man whose spirit is without restraint v. 28 . Blessed is the man who always fears, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity 28:14 .
[27]  LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE EIGHT USING PROVERBS FOR BUILDING UP THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Rom 8:20-21, 23; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Eph 4:30; 2 Cor 4:16
[28]  In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the proper way to receive and to use the book of Proverbs.
[29]  We may know the position of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs in the Bible, but we may not know the way to take the book of Proverbs.
[30]  The Bible shows us that man has become fallen and needs to be redeemed.
[31]  In the view of God's economy, we became fallen in Adam six thousand years ago Rom 5:12 ; Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 ; and we were regenerated through Christ's resurrection almost two thousand years ago.
[32]  When Paul received an abundance of revelations, having been caught away to the third heaven and to Paradise, God was concerned that he might become proud 2 Cor 12:1-7 .
[33]  Solomon had unequaled wisdom, the supreme position, unsurpassed wealth, and hundreds of wives and concubines, and fell in the indulgence of his lust to an unparalleled extent.
[34]  Through all the positive and negative experiences of the human life under the sun, his thought was deeply impressed and occupied with the central thought of this book, that is, the vanity of vanities of the human life under the sun in its falling away from God.
[35]  Man was created by God with the highest and most noble purpose, that is, to express Him in the resemblance of Him in His life, nature, and expression.
[36]  Yet he was not fully disappointed in this, but rather he instructed men that there is a way to get out of this vanity, that is, to come back to God and take God as man's everything, redemption, life, wealth, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction, that man still may be used by God to fulfill His original purpose in man for the fulfillment of His eternal economy Eccl.
[37]  Solomon, as a man who had labored with wisdom, knowledge, skill, and striving and would leave the issue of his labor to a man who had not labored, hated all his labor under the sun and despaired of it because he would leave his gain to the man after him, considering it a great evil, sorrow, and vexation that caused his heart to have no rest in the night.
[38]  1 God Having Given the Children of Men to Travail
[39]  God has made everything beautiful in its own time and has put eternity an aspiration for the things in eternity in man's heart, yet so that man does not find out what God has done from the beginning to the end v. 11 . In His creation of man, God put something into man which Solomon called "eternity." This means that in man there is a kind of aspiration for God, an aspiration for something eternal.
[40]  Whatever God does will be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor can anything be taken from it, that all would fear Him that they may have His wisdom to realize the real meaning of human life vv.
[41]  LIFE-STUDY OF ECCLESIASTES MESSAGE TWO VANITY OF VANITIES 2 Scripture Reading: Eccl.
[42]  e. Not Delaying in Paying Our Vow to God
[43]  Verses 4 through 6 tell us not to delay in paying our vow to God.
[44]  e. A Man Whose Soul Is Not Filled with Good
[45]  A man begets a hundred children and lives many years, but his soul is not filled with good and he even does not get a proper burial.
[46]  In all his experiments Solomon encouraged, according to God's economy, the fallen men under the sun to enjoy what God has given to them that they may exist and afford God the opportunity to carry out His eternal purpose in choosing and predestinating them for the issue of the Body of Christ and to maintain the fallen man of God's old creation to be the provision for God to bring in His new creation in Christ out of the old creation 2:24; 3:13; 5:18-20; 8:15; 9:7-10 .
[47]  In 7:1 12:12 we have the writer's searching and testing.
[48]  Man should enjoy God's provision for his living and the marriage life for man's existence and multiplication to replenish the earth Gen 1:28 that it may be possible for God to save some of them in order to produce the church the Body of Christ which will issue in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression according to God's eternal economy Eccl.
[49]  All the concluding words may be considered as proverbs, words of wisdom, directing the fallen and aim-missing men to return to God and receive Him according to His New Testament economy in His Son as their Redeemer and life that they may be regenerated to be the God-men for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.
[50]  The bright environment with the three lights created by God and the artificial ones made by man becomes gloomy, and the pleasant atmosphere of the clear sky is cloudy v. 2 . The hands, the keepers of the house, tremble v. 3a . The loins, the men of strength, are bent v. 3b . The teeth become few v. 3c , the eyes become dim v. 3d , and the ears become dull to sound v. 4a . One awakens early in the morning v. 4b . The vocal cords become low v. 4c . One is afraid of what is high v. 5a and is terrified in walking v. 5b . The hair becomes white v. 5c . One is unable to bear any burden, even any as small as a grasshopper v. 5d . No medicine can keep the old man away from death, and mourners attend his funeral v. 5e . The corpse the spinal cord the silver cord , the head the golden bowl , the lungs the pitcher , and the heart the wheel decays v. 6 . The body made of dust returns to the earth, and the breath returns to God who gave it v. 7; Gen 2:7 . This indicates that the entire human being with his human life apart from God is nothing but vanity of vanity Eccl.
[51]  In 12:13-14 we have the writer's concluding word.
[52]  The writer's intention is to lead men to fear God that God may eventually show them His New Testament economy concerning the producing of His church, the Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression v. 13 .
[53]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD
[54]  The contents of Song of Songs are the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ.
[55]  In verse 4a we have a word concerning the lover's pursuing: "Draw me; we will run after you."
[56]  In her pursuit of Christ, she asks Him to draw her that she and her companions may run after Him.
[57]  In her fellowship with Christ, she is also instructed by Him in the way to enter into the church life vv.
[58]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE TWO DRAWN TO PURSUE CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION 2 Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:9 2:7
[59]  In 1:2-4a we see that the lover of Christ yearned for Christ, sought Him, and was attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to run after Him.
[60]  The lover of Christ is transformed from a strong natural person a mare among Pharaoh's chariots 1:9 into a person who lives a life not relying upon herself but trusting in Him lily 2:1-2; Matt 6:28 and looking to Him with a single eye eyes like doves S.S. 1:15b; Matt 10:16 . At the beginning, the lover of Christ is strong naturally, like a mare among Pharaoh's chariots, but gradually she is transformed into a lily, one who is no longer full of natural strength but is full of life.
[61]  "Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments,/Your neck with strings of jewels" S.S. 1:10 . Here the Beloved appreciates her loveliness in submission to Him cheeks lovely with plaits of ornaments and her beauty in obedience to the transforming Spirit neck with strings of jewels . The expression of this lover of Christ is full of submission followed by obedience.
[62]  "We will make you plaits of gold/With studs of silver" v. 11 . The transforming Spirit and the lover's companions we will adorn her with the constitution of the life of God plaits of gold by the redeeming work of Christ studs of silver . God's nature and Christ's redemption are put together by the Spirit and the companions to be her adornment.
[63]  "My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh/That lies at night between my breasts./My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers/In the vineyards of En-gedi" S.S. 1:13-14 . In these verses we see that she enjoys Him privately at night in His death a bundle of myrrh in her embracing with love and faith breasts 1 Tim 1:14; 1 Thes 5:8 . Every lover of Christ is full of faith and love and embraces Him with faith and love.
[64]  to Him with a Single Eye by the Spirit
[65]  Your eyes are like doves" S.S. 1:15 . He appreciates her beauty in looking to Him with a single eye by the Spirit eyes like doves v. 15 . The first striking aspect of our beauty in the sight of the Lord Jesus is our single eye toward Him.
[66]  "He brought me into the banqueting house,/And his banner over me was love./Sustain me with raisin cakes,/Refresh me with apples,/For I am sick with love" S.S. 2:4-5 . Here the lover is satisfied with triumphant love banner of love spread over her in the enjoyable church life banqueting house , in which she is sustained with Him, Christ, as bread of life John 6:35 raisin cakes and refreshed with Him as fruit of life Rev 2:7; 22:2 apples to heal her lovesickness.
[67]  B. He Taking Care of Her Rest in Him
[68]  "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,/By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields,/Not to rouse up or awaken my love/Until she pleases" S.S. 2:7 . Here we see that He takes care of her rest in Him.
[69]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE THREE CALLED TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE SELF
[70]  THROUGH THE ONENESS WITH THE CROSS Scripture Reading: S.S. 2:8 3:5
[71]  As we will see when we come to the end of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ eventually sighs because she is still in the old creation.
[72]  She longs to be fully like Christ, who has absolutely nothing to do with anything of the old creation.
[73]  The lover of Christ is called to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross by Christ's resurrection power through His fellowship S.S. 2:8-9 .
[74]  "Flowers appear on the earth;/The time of singing has come,/And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
[75]  "My dove, in the clefts of the rock,/In the covert of the precipice,/Let me see your countenance,/Let me hear your voice;/For your voice is sweet,/And your countenance is lovely" v. 14 . Here Christ, considering her His simple lover My dove , wants to see His lover's lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice . Here we see Christ's call for His lover to be in oneness with the cross.
[76]  "Catch the foxes for us,/The little foxes,/That ruin the vineyards/While our vineyards are in blossom" S.S. 2:15 . Christ charges His lover to be aware of her peculiarities, habits, and introspections little foxes which ruin the resurrection for His lover our vineyards in blossom .
[77]  "My beloved is mine, and I am his;/He pastures his flock among the lilies" v. 16 . She realizes that Christ belongs to her and she to Christ according to her feeling, yet He is not with her, but He is away feeding His pure and trusting followers pastures among the lilies . At this point she and Christ are not one.
[78]  "Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away,/Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart/On the mountains of Bether" v. 17 . Here she rejects Him by asking Him to wait until her down situation is over and then to turn to her in His resurrection, like a gazelle or a young hart, at the time of their separation, which could be removed only by Him and not by her on the mountains of Bether . The word Bether means "separation." The lover seemed to be saying to Him, "Lord, I am not ready.
[79]  In her introspection, in her down situation, she seeks her Beloved, but she fails to find Him.
[80]  "Scarcely had I passed them/When I found him whom my soul loves;/I held him and would not let go/Until I had brought him into my mother's house/And into the chamber of her who conceived me" S.S. 3:4 . Not long after she leaves the ones who watch over God's people, she finds her Beloved, and she holds Him and will not let go until she brings Him into the Spirit of grace, through which she was regenerated mother's house chamber Heb 10:29; Gal 4:26; Eph 2:4-5; Gal 5:4 for secret fellowship.
[81]  "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,/By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields,/Not to rouse up or awaken my love/Until she pleases" S.S. 3:5 . Here Christ charges the meddling believers daughters of Jerusalem not to awaken her from her experience of Christ in her being delivered from the self, secluded in her introspection, into her secret fellowship with Him until she feels pleasant concerning her next experience of Him she pleases .
[82]  AS THE NEW CREATION IN RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: S. S. 3:6 5:1
[83]  In the second stage S. S. 2:8 3:5 the lover of Christ learned three basic lessons: the power of resurrection, the riches of resurrection, and the life of the cross.
[84]  The power of Christ s resurrection is signified by Christ as a gazelle and a hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills 2:8-9 .
[85]  Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead v. 1 . In this verse we see the beauty in her singleness and insight by the Spirit, which is invisible to the outsiders, and in her submission and obedience through God s feeding that subdues her disobedience among the disobedient people.
[86]  Your lips are like a scarlet thread, / And your mouth is lovely; / Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil v. 3 . This is her beauty in her speaking with Christ s redemption and His authority by her lovely mouth and in her expression full of life which is hidden.
[87]  The lover does not answer the Beloved s call audibly.
[88]  Verse 9 indicates that she gives a silent answer: You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; / You have ravished my heart with one glance of your eyes, / With one strand of your necklace.
[89]  Here He considers her as one with Him in nature and as His bride, whose answer without voice, by a quick look and by her submission to God s instruction, has ravished His heart.
[90]  / How much better is your love than wine, / And the fragrance of your ointments / Than all spices v. 10 . Considering her as one with Him in nature and as His bride, He enjoys her beautiful love, which is much better than wine, and her ointments, which were the King s 1:3 and are more fragrant than all spices.
[91]  BY DISCERNING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL Scripture Reading: S. S. 4:7-15; Heb 4:12; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Cor 4:16
[92]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE SIX CALLED MORE STRONGLY TO LIVE WITHIN THE VEIL
[93]  In 5:2 6:3 the lover of Christ is called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection.
[94]  In verses 4 and 5 she opened the door.
[95]  My beloved put his hand into the opening of the door, / And my inner parts yearned for him v. 4 . Her Beloved showed His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that her inner parts were moved to yearn for Him.
[96]  His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh v. 13 . His countenance is beautiful and sweet through His suffering of people s smiting and despising, and His mouth is pure, releasing sweet words of grace based upon His redemption.
[97]  You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem v. 4a . Her Beloved, treasuring her as His love, praises her that she is beautiful as the heavenly sanctuary Tirzah 1 Kings 14:17 and lovely as the heavenly Jerusalem Gal 4:26; Heb 12:22 , indicating that she lives in the Holy of Holies within the veil, experiencing the ascension of Christ through the cross after her experience of His resurrection.
[98]  Previously the lover was likened to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh s chariots, a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring, but now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem, indicating her maturity in life for God s building.
[99]  Here we see that her Beloved Solomon, typifying Christ in a positive sense is loved by many different believers, some as queens, some as concubines, and some as virgins all in the positive sense in poetry , but her Beloved, considering her as His love and perfect one, praises her as the only one lover of Him, the only and choice one regenerated by grace.
[100]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE EIGHT SHARING IN THE WORK OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: S. S. 7:1-13
[101]  By the end of chapter six the lover, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become Solomon s duplication.
[102]  Going down smoothly for my beloved, / Gliding through the lips of those who sleep v. 9b . Here she continues her Beloved s word, wishing that the Lord would enjoy smoothly what she could be, and that those who love God in losing consciousness of themselves would enjoy what the Lord would enjoy.
[103]  / These, my beloved, I have stored up for you v. 13 . In her working together with her Beloved there is a mutual love signified by the mandrakes Gen 30:14 giving forth its fragrance between them as a couple loving each other, signifying the bridal love between the lover of Christ and Christ, and in their working places there are plenty of fragrant and choice fruits, new and old, which she stores up for her Beloved in love.
[104]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE NINE HOPING TO BE RAPTURED Scripture Reading: S. S. 8:1-14
[105]  Song of Songs 8 reveals the lover s hope to be raptured.
[106]  Realizing all the troubles from her flesh, she wishes that the Lord could be her brother in the flesh who was born of grace, the same as she is, and that she could kiss Him as one who is the same as she is in the flesh and no one would despise her.
[107]  / His left hand would be under my head, / And his right hand would embrace me S. S. 8:2-3 . Here she hopes that she and her Beloved could meet in the heavenly Jerusalem, where she is perfected by grace, and that she could afford her Beloved a way to enjoy the riches of her experience of the divine life for His satisfaction in His embracing, as what He did to her before rapture 2:6 .
[108]  She asks her Beloved to keep her by His love and His strength, for His love is as strong as the unshakable death and His jealousy is as cruel as the unconquerable Sheol, which is like the jealous Jehovah Exo 20:5; 2 Cor 11:2 , who is a consuming fire Heb 12:29 that burns up all the negative things that can be burned.
[109]  S. S. 8:8 . Since the lover has matured in life in pursuing Christ and in her ultimate consummation of her experience of Christ, before her rapture she with Christ is concerned for the younger lovers of Christ.
[110]  If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar S. S. 8:9 . If one is a wall for the separation of sanctification, she with her Beloved will perfect her by building upon her a battlement based upon the redemption of Christ Rom 3:24 . If one is a door as an entry for people to enter into Christ, she with her Beloved will perfect her by building an enclosure around her with Christ s heavenly and glorified humanity Matt 26:64; Acts 3:13 and His heavenly human life Phil 2:7-8 .
[111]  Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices v. 14 . The lover of her Beloved prays that He would make haste to come back in the power of His resurrection to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom which will fill the whole earth Rev 11:15; Dan 2:35 . Here we should note that the prayer of this lover of her Beloved is the concluding word of this poetic book, portraying the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, as the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, is the concluding word of the Holy Scripture, revealing God s eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love Rev 22:20 .
[112]  LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE TEN THE FOUR STAGES
[113]  OF SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE IN SONG OF SONGS Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-4a; 2:14; 4:8; 6:4
[114]  The third stage is to be called by Christ to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ 3:6 5:1 .
[115]  Christ s death is followed by Christ s resurrection, and in His resurrection we are a new creation.
