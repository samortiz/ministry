<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Meeting and Serving in Mutuality<br>according to the God-ordained Way</H2><P>For the church life in God's economy, we need to meet and serve in mutuality according to the God-ordained way. Our meetings should be in mutuality with all the saints of different ages functioning for the building up of the church. A meeting in mutuality is "music."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Fulfilling the New Testament<br>Gospel Priesthood for Begetting</H2><P>To meet and serve according to God's ordained way is first to fulfill the New Testament gospel priesthood for begetting (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Cor. 4:15). Our preaching of the gospel is not merely for winning souls. It is for begetting sinners to make them the sons of God, the brothers of Christ, and the members of Christ to constitute Christ's Body. This Body is the house of God and the kingdom of God which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Nourishing and Cherishing<br>the New Believers in Home Meetings</H2><P>The new believers who have been begotten through our preaching of the gospel need to be nourished and cherished in home meetings (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2). We should not gather them into our home. Instead, we need to go to their homes and bring them "food to go." When we go to people's homes, we should not go in a formal, ritualistic, and religious way. If we do this, we spontaneously become the clergy. We need to start the home meetings in a rejoicing, singing way. As we are approaching the door of the new ones' homes, we should be singing. The new ones will hear our singing, and they will respond to this. If we are going to care for the new believers, we cannot take our natural way. This is why we need to learn and be instructed and trained to practice the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Perfecting the Saints in Group Meetings<br>That They May Be Able to Do the Work of the Ministry,<br>That Is, to Build Up the Body of Christ</H2><P>The God-ordained way also includes perfecting the saints in group meetings that they may be able to do the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12; Heb. 10:24-25). In addition to feeding the new ones in their homes, we should gather them together for group meetings. The group meetings should not be formal, but very spontaneous and living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Prophesying in the Church Meetings<br>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>through the Local Churches</H2><P>Finally, we need to prophesy in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ through the local churches (1 Cor. 14:1-5, 12, 31). We need to learn to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord in order to minister Christ to people. If we all exercise our spirit in the meetings to prophesy, we will have living, fresh, uplifted, and rich meetings. Then the universal Body of Christ will be built up through the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Having the Adequate and Proper Leadership<br>for the Keeping of a Good Order<br>with the All-inclusive Christ as the Center<br>and the Processed Triune God as the Manifestation</H2><P>To meet as a proper local church, we need to have the adequate and proper leadership for the keeping of a good order (1 Cor. 14:40) with the all-inclusive Christ as the center and the processed Triune God as the manifestation (Col. 3:10-11; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). In every church, we should have the proper leadership, and this leadership is the deputy authority, the authority representing God in His administration.</P><P>According to the principles ordained in God's government, deputy authority is everywhere on earth. In a family there are the parents; in a school there are the teachers and the principal; and in a city there are the mayor and the police with the law courts. Without the proper government and the police, a city would not be in the proper order. It would become riotous without any deputy authority.</P><P>In the church life, we need to keep a good order by taking, receiving, and accepting the proper leadership. Among the saints there are always some who can take the leadership according to the apostles' teaching. Actually, the proper leadership is the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42), the teaching of the New Testament. The apostles' teaching is our leadership. This is similar to saying that the Constitution of the United States is our country's leadership, the highest authority. The president takes the lead according to the Constitution. If the president is mistaken in anything, he will be corrected by the Constitution. Our constitution in the Lord's recovery is the apostles' teaching, the teaching of the New Testament. The teaching of the New Testament is our leadership. When we have the adequate and proper leadership in the churches, we can have a becoming and orderly church life to exhibit Christ and to glorify the Father.</P>
