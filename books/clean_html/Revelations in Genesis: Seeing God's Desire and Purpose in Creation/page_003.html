<h2 class="head2">The Process of Creation</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The heavens include heaven, celestial phenomena, and the angels living in heaven. The earth includes the creatures that live on the earth. According to Job 38:4-7, the morning stars and the angels existed before God created the earth. Hence, God created first the heavens and then the earth. When God created the earth, He measured it, stretching a measuring line over it; He made the earth in good order and exceedingly beautiful and delightful. When God created the earth, the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God&mdash;the angels (1:6; 2:1)&mdash;shouted for joy because the earth was beautiful.</p>
<p>The universe that God created had no shadow of sin or trace of chaos; it was altogether bright and beautiful. This shows the radiance and beauty of the Creator. Although the Bible provides very little description of the condition of the earth when it was created, Job 38:7 shows a glimpse of a joyful and harmonious scene: &ldquo;The morning stars sang together / And all the sons of God shouted for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S REBELLION</h2>
<p>The joyful and harmonious condition of God&rsquo;s original creation did not last. At a certain point, the greatest tragedy in the universe took place&mdash;Satan rebelled and was corrupted. Genesis 1:2 says, &ldquo;But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep.&rdquo; The earth that God created was neither waste nor emptiness, and darkness was not on the surface of the deep (Isa. 45:18); the earth became such later. The earth became waste and emptiness with darkness on the surface of the deep because Satan rebelled and was corrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Satan</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, after God created the heavens and the earth, Satan was appointed to rule the world (Luke 4:5-6; John 12:31; 14:30; Eph. 2:2). Satan was called the Daystar, son of the dawn (Isa. 14:12). He is one of the first angels (the sons of God&mdash;Job 38:7; cf. 1:6) created by God at the dawn of the universe, and he was the anointed cherub who covered the Ark (Ezek. 28:12-14). Satan was appointed by God to be an archangel; thus, there are angels under him (Rev. 12:7; Matt. 25:41). He must have been given a very high position because he was even higher than Michael the archangel (Jude 9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan&rsquo;s Rebellion</h2>
<p>Because of the pride in his heart, the God-appointed archangel exalted himself to be equal with God, rebelling against God and becoming God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan (Isa. 14:13-14; Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:9; 20:2). Therefore, he was judged by God (Isa. 14:15; Ezek. 28:16-19).</p>
<p>Satan took the lead to rebel against and overthrow God&rsquo;s sovereignty. Some of the angels, who were set under Satan by God to help him rule the preadamic world, followed Satan to rebel. Hence, when God judged Satan, He also judged the angels under him (Rev. 12:4, 9). These rebellious angels became the rulers and the authorities of the air and the officers in Satan&rsquo;s kingdom to rule the world of this darkness together with him (Eph. 1:21; 2:2; 6:12; Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were creatures living in the preadamic world. When Satan rebelled, they followed him and rebelled. As a result, they too were judged by God and became demons (Mark 1:32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33), ministers of Satan running about the earth in order to fulfill Satan&rsquo;s evil will.</p>
<p>Because Satan, the fallen angels, and the creatures living in the preadamic world rebelled against God, the heavens and the earth, which they ruled and in which they dwelled, were defiled (Col. 1:20, footnote 5; Heb. 9:23, footnote 1). Hence, the heavens and the earth were also judged when God judged Satan, the fallen angels, and the creatures. The original situation of order, beauty, and light disappeared. Job 9:5-7 says that when God judged in anger, He commanded the sun not to rise, and He sealed up the stars. As a result, the sun and the stars did not shine, and the earth was enveloped in darkness and submerged under deep waters; the earth became waste and emptiness, with darkness on the surface of the deep (Gen. 1:2).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 4:23, Isaiah 34:11, and 2 Peter 3:6 reveal that the earth&rsquo;s becoming waste and emptiness with darkness on the surface of the deep was the result of God&rsquo;s judgment. This indicates that God judged the preadamic world by flooding it with water. God&rsquo;s original creation was destroyed by God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
