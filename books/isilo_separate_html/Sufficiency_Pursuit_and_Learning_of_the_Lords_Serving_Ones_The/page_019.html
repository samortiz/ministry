<p>Second, Brother Nee said that we do not have a problem with receiving spiritual riches. However, we were raised up by the Lord in this age not merely to receive and inherit the spiritual riches of the past two thousand years of church history. We were raised up by the Lord to inherit these riches for the church. Brother Nee saw that in God&rsquo;s intention all the spiritual riches are for the church. He said that in the past, after obtaining a certain experience, some believers adopted it as their own spirituality. For example, although holiness is for the church, holiness believers focus on holiness merely for their own spirituality. These believers seek only their own spirituality. They do not know that spirituality is for the church. Baptism, another example, is for the church. However, the Baptist denomination adopted the truth concerning baptism merely for the salvation of individuals, thereby changing the church into a Baptist Church.</p>
<p>Brother Nee gave numerous examples to show that although in God&rsquo;s intention spiritual riches are for the church, few believers after the apostles have paid attention to the church. It was not until 1828, when Brother J. N. Darby was raised up by the Lord, that believers saw the church. No one after the apostles surpassed Darby in his gifts. We must thank the Lord for giving such a great gift to the church. Western Christianity greatly appreciates the gift of John Wesley, but J. N. Darby&rsquo;s gift was greater than that of John Wesley. However, Western Christianity knows only John Wesley, not J. N. Darby.</p>
<p>Our knowledge and emphasis concerning the church should be attributed to the help that we received from J. N. Darby. However, as a result of the subsequent divisions among the Brethren, the truth concerning the church is rather confused in Western Christianity. Hence, Western Christianity hardly touches the matter of the church. Concerning the church, Eastern Christianity is like virgin soil that has not been damaged. We must humbly admit that J. N. Darby was a great servant used by God. However, after receiving help from him, we have gone further, even though we are small servants of the Lord. We have seen that God desires the church in reality. All the spiritual gifts that God has bestowed on the believers during the past two thousand years are for the building up of the church in reality as His corporate vessel to express His Son.</p>
<p>One day in a private conversation, Brother Nee asked me to read the last verse of Ephesians 1. The verse says, &ldquo;[The church], which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (v. 23). He said that the word <em>fullness</em> here is like a foreign word. He said that we should not know the church only as the Body of Christ but that we should know the church also as the fullness of Christ. The church being the fullness of Christ means that the church is the overflow of Christ. He also said that after God created Adam, He caused a woman, Eve, to overflow from Adam. Eve was the fullness of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22). At that time I was already married. Brother Nee told me that he, being single, did not have a fullness, but that I, having a wife, had a fullness. For two thousand years God gave spiritual riches in order to gain a corporate vessel to be His fullness. This fullness pleased God. God desired that His Son would be manifested in this vessel, and this vessel is the expression of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attacks, Troubles, and Criticisms<br />
Being Related to the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>Brother Nee said that all the sufferings and ordeals that came to us were not because we were wrong. We inherited spiritual things from the believers who have gone before us, and others have welcomed what we gave them. For example, many Chinese Christians had never heard of Madame Guyon or received any spiritual help from her. When we translated her autobiography, other believers were edified. We showed other believers Madame Guyon&rsquo;s attitude toward life in her forsaking the world and voluntarily choosing the cross, and they received it. We translated Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith&rsquo;s writings, as well as the writings of Andrew Murray and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. Other believers welcomed the spiritual things from the past generations. In these matters, we did not fight, and other believers did not give us any trouble. All our afflictions were due to the truth concerning the church and due to our saying that all spiritual riches are for the church and are in the church.</p>
<p>The practice of the church depends on the ground and on coordination. Without the ground and without coordination, the church cannot exist; it remains abstract. If we do not speak concerning the ground of the church and concerning coordination, the church is merely a term without reality. Both the ground and coordination are practical. In order for the church to be practical, there must be the definite ground of the church and the practical coordination to carry out the service. Without these two items, the church would be merely a vision that could not be put into practice. In order for the church to be practical, there must be the practical ground and the practical coordination.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that all the attacks from outsiders were due to the matter of the ground. If we would give up the ground of the church, the attacks would cease. The ground is the one point in which we cannot be in harmony with the denominations and the other groups in Christianity. If we would give up the ground, we would still be very spiritual, and we would also be able to work with every other Christian. But when we bring up the matter of the ground, other Christians oppose us. These words indicate that our brother&rsquo;s suffering in China was mainly because of the matter of the ground.</p>
<p>Among the missionary groups that first went to China, three were rather spiritual: China Inland Mission, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and the Baptist denomination. Once, a brother in China Inland Mission asked Brother Nee whether China Inland Mission was a denomination. Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;If you say that you are not a denomination, I will not argue with you. However, let me ask, what is China Inland Mission? If you say that you are a missionary group, what is the result of your work? We all know that Paul, Timothy, and their companions were sent out to work, and the result of their work was the establishing of churches. They established the church in Corinth and the church in Ephesus. They did not establish Paul&rsquo;s Missionary Society or Timothy&rsquo;s Missionary Society. May I ask you, what is the result of China Inland Mission&rsquo;s work in China? Is it not to establish China Inland Mission in many places? This shows that China Inland Mission is replacing the churches.&rdquo; Eventually, the brother said that China Inland Mission would gradually hand everything over; it would withdraw and let the local believers form churches. This was the reply by someone in China Inland Mission.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that for close to a hundred years China Inland Mission had been preaching the gospel in China but that its goal was wrong. It was right to preach the gospel in China, but its goal was wrong. Many of the missionaries who went to China rendered much spiritual help to the believers. The missionaries did a substantial work in spiritual matters, but they were short in the matter of the ground. This shows that the conflicts we had with Christians were centered entirely on the matter of the ground. The sufferings we experienced, as well as the attacks, troubles, and criticisms, were all because of the ground. If we had compromised, even a little, concerning the ground of the church, we would not have had any problems, and we would have been welcomed everywhere.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
