   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE GRAIN FALLING TO PRODUCE MANY GRAINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 12:24 touches the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the highest and most crucial passage in the Bible because it touches God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord compared His death to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible never uses wheat as a type of redemption, because wheat has no blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The death of the grain of wheat refers to the non-redemptive aspect of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the one grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the outside of the grain, there is a glossy shell, which locks the life of the grain inside.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for the life to be released, the grain must first be buried into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's life is like a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The life of this grain is bound by its outward shell, and unless the outward shell is removed by the grain passing through death, the wheat will never grow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the grain is buried in the ground, the moisture and humidity of the earth act on the shell and break it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a few days the grain sprouts, and after a few months, hundreds of grains are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said that He was like a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life was in Him, but unless He died, He would forever be the only One, because God had only one Son; He was the only Begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was the only One who had life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He became flesh and came to the earth, His life was bound by the flesh even though He was God's Son and had God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Men could not receive His life, and He could not bring forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose one hundred grains are harvested from one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How many grains would there be?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There would be one hundred and one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the one grain has died, one hundred grains are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Originally, there was only one unique grain, who is God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What happened to the original one grain?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It became the first grain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Originally, it was the unique one; now it has become the first of one hundred and one grains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Originally, He was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now through death and resurrection, He has become God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the Lord Jesus died, He was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After resurrection, He became God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My friends, please remember that death and resurrection have the same boundary line.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the Lord's death, God had only one Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the Lord's resurrection, God has many children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord became the first grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Originally, there was only one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now there are hundreds of grains.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is the difference between the hundreds of grains and the first grain?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a mustard seed is sown, mustard comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a grain of wheat is sown, wheat comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord Jesus is planted, what comes out must be the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was an elderly black woman in Africa who was a very spiritual sister.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She did not have any education and was not eloquent at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet many people went to her for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One British pastor once went to her and asked, "What are Christians?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She answered, "They are fragments of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is indeed well said.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am afraid that many doctors of divinity cannot answer the question the way she did.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every Christian has a little bit of Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The hundreds of grains are produced from the first grain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the hundreds of grains are put together, you have the original grain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Christ and all the Christians are added together, we have the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have often been amazed by 1 Corinthians 12:12.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not know whether others are equally amazed when they read this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This verse tells us that just as a body has many members and is still one body, so also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Paul, have you made a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why did you not use the word church?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should have said, "So also is Christ and the church."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But was Paul wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not speak of the church, because the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not have to say Christ and the church, because the church is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In reading the Bible, we should make a distinction between two different aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Greek, when the name Christ is used without a definite article, it refers to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When it is used with a definite article, it refers to the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Most versions do not make this distinction clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only Darby's translation brings out this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a difference between Christ and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The former refers to the individual Christ, while the latter refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Christ refers not only to one individual, but to the corporate man composed of all those who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This corporate man becomes the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The individual Christ refers to Jesus; He was not corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is the Head, and all Christians combined together form His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The individual Christ becomes the Head of the corporate Christ, and the whole is called the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through His death Christ becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Within every saved person there is now a little bit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone has a little bit of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is why we break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Originally, there was one bread, but God charges us to break it and each take a piece of it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is only one bread before us, and when we put together all the pieces that each one has taken, we have the same one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Within each one of us there is a little bit of that bread.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Within each one of us there is a little bit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our Lord was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After death and resurrection, He begot many sons, and He Himself became the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the physical world, how does one grain produce many grains?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It was most suitable for the Lord to use this illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the natural realm, one grain can be turned into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the same way, one Christ can be multiplied to become the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>How does one grain become so many grains?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We do not know, but we do know that this multiplication is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christ is the seed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God has sown Christ into the earth, and many Christians have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Through His death and resurrection, Christ released His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>After resurrection, He said to His disciples, "I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Originally, God was His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After the Lord's resurrection, God became our Father also, and Christ, who had been the only begotten Son, became the firstborn Son among many sons.</S>
