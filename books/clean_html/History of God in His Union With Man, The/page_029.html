<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Issue</H2><P>The issue of man's fall is terrifyingly great. It implies mainly the following eight items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Entering into Man<br>to Be Man's Indwelling Sin</H2><P>Satan as the evil one (Matt. 6:13) entered into man through man's eating of his evil fruit from the tree of knowledge. Through this, Satan's evil nature surely became the evil element added into man's nature. Romans 7:17-21 unveils that something evil as an evil law dwells in man to be the very sin that dwells in man, causing man to do things that man does not will. What is this evil to be the indwelling sin in man's fallen nature? It must be the evil one, Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature. This issue of man's fall is too, too terrifying!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sin Entering into Mankind</H2><P>Since Satan, who is the substantial element of sin, has entered into man, sin spontaneously entered into man with Satan. Since this entering of sin into man was its entering into Adam, the forefather of man, sin entered into all of mankind, the world (Rom. 5:12a), through this one entering. Today all of mankind, the whole world, has sin in their fallen nature to make them sinners in their constitution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Sin Bringing Death to Mankind</H2><P>The very sin which dwells in man is productive. It issues in death. Death is the wages of sin (Rom. 6:23a) and was brought into man through sin (Rom. 5:12b). Hence, Satan, sin, and death, three terrifying and damaging factors, entered into man, even mankind, through man's fall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Sin Bringing Vanity and the Slavery<br>of Corruption to All the Creation</H2><P>Sin not only brought death to all mankind but also brought vanity and the slavery of corruption to all the creation (Rom. 8:20-21). Today due to man's fall, all the creation is subjected to vanity and the slavery of corruption. Everything in God's creation is being corrupted under a kind of slavery and is becoming vanity. Hence, the whole creation is groaning together, and there is no joy in the universe today.</P>
