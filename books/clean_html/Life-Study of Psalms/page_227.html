<P>The New Testament also reveals that when Christ died, He ended the old creation. On the third day He was resurrected, and through His resurrection He regenerated us (1 Pet. 1:3) to be a new man, not a man of Adam and in Adam but a man of Christ and in Christ.</P><P>Many, however, are devoid of such a revelation. Lacking this revelation, you may come out of your tomb and go back to Adam and try to correct Adam, to build up Adam, to change Adam from bad to good. This is what you are doing when you try to keep the law in order to be perfect, righteous, and just and to have integrity. You are actually trying to improve fallen and degraded Adam. Many of today's Christians are doing this very thing.</P><P>Also, you may meet with the church without knowing the purpose of the church. You may think that the church is helping you to be good. No, the church is helping you to remain in your tomb so that you will no longer be the one living but that Christ will be the One living in you. In the church we are being helped to realize, with Paul, that we have been crucified, that it is no longer we who live, that Christ lives in us, and that now we should care only for one thing&#151;to live Christ that we may magnify Christ.</P><P>Whereas many of us are remaining in Job or in the Psalms, we need to be brought by these two books into the New Testament economy. I would ask you to compare Job and the Psalms with the fourteen Epistles of Paul. If you make such a comparison, you will realize that Paul's Epistles are vastly superior to Job and the Psalms.</P><P>Before Paul was saved, he boasted in the righteousness of the law, but after he was saved he considered that kind of righteousness as dung, as refuse (Phil. 3:8-9). Can you say this about your own goodness, righteousness, justice, and integrity? Do you hate these things and count them as dung? On the contrary, you may treasure these human virtues. But these are the virtues of a dead person, and God does not want them, for they are something of Adam and in Adam. God wants only those virtues that are in Christ and of Christ, the virtues that come by living Christ and magnifying Christ.</P><P>If you see this, you will repent not only for being bad but also for being good. Both are of the same tree&#151;the tree of the knowledge of good and evil&#151;and both are rejected by God. As we go through the Psalms message by message, I hope that this will become increasingly clear to you.</P><P>My concern in all these messages is for the divine revelation. I hope that you will receive this revelation and thereby come to know what God's eternal economy is. God's economy is to terminate us and to put us into the tomb so that we may receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. Having received Him into us, we should let Him live in us, no longer caring for our righteousness, justice, or integrity but caring only for Christ, the living One. It is a great thing to see that we have been crucified and that it is no longer we who live but that it is Christ who lives in us. If we realize this, we will care only for Christ, and we will eagerly receive the revelation in Paul's Epistles concerning Christ.</P>
