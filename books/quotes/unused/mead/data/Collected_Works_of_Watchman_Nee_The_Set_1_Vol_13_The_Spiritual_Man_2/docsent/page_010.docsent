   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE SPIRITUAL WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a believer gradually progresses on his spiritual path, he will gradually see more clearly that living for himself is a sin, even the greatest sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A believer who lives for himself is like a grain of wheat which is not willing to fall into the ground and die; therefore, he remains just one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A believer may seek the filling of the Holy Spirit and want to become a spiritual man with power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is his goal, however?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is to make himself happy and feel more comfortable!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he is asked to live completely for God and God's work, regardless of his own happiness and feeling, he will shrink and not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that he misunderstands the meaning of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the deepest part of his heart, the self-love of the soul-life has not been forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every person who is a child of God is a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone has received a gift from the Lord; no one is without a gift Matt 25:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God places each believer in His church and gives each one a portion of labor which he must fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's intention, from the beginning to the end, is not that the believers' spirit should become a pool of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this were so, the water would begin to dry up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The regression of a believer and the decrease of spiritual power are probably mainly due to this cause.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once the life of God is blocked up in the spirit, a believer begins to feel the drought.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the spiritual life is for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spiritual work is nothing less than the expression of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The secret of living a spiritual life is to let life flow out without interruption and reach the lives of others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The food of the believer's spiritual life is to work the work of God John 4:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a spiritual believer beginners have not advanced sufficiently enough to be considered here exclusively pays attention to his own spirituality, making his Bible reading and prayer his recreation, then as he cares for himself, the kingdom of God suffers a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must believe that God can sustain him, not only physically but also spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he is willing to bear the hunger, not seeking food when he is hungry, but seeking only to do what God wants of him, he will be fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To obey and do the will of God is to eat spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In contrast, those who pay attention to things that nourish them will obtain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But those who single-heartedly care for the things of the kingdom of God will be fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a believer does not care for himself, but only minds the Father's business, he will see that he is always full and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A believer must never overly desire something new.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What he really needs is to guard what he has gained so that it will not be lost, because what has not been lost has been gained.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to guard is to use what he has gained, because burying it in the ground is a sure way to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a believer lets the life in his spirit flow everywhere, he not only gains other people, but he also gains himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this gain is due not to wanting to gain himself but to losing himself to gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spiritual life within the spiritual man must flow out by means of spiritual work without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the spirit of the believer is habitually open it must be shut to the enemy then the life of God will flow out from it to save and build up many people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once spiritual work stops, spiritual life is hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two things cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No matter what worldly profession a believer may have, there is always a sphere of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spiritual believer knows his place in the Body of Christ; therefore, he also knows the sphere of his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every member has his usefulness, and fulfilling his usefulness is his work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some gifts are for certain kinds of members, and some gifts are for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The believer must know the sphere of his own gift and work within that sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Herein lies the failure of many spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Either they withdraw from work so that the spiritual life does not have the possibility to develop, or they work outside their sphere so that the spiritual life is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The harm from not using the hands and feet is the same as misusing the hands and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Retaining the spiritual life is the unique way to lose it, but working recklessly also hinders the release of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>SPIRITUAL POWER</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to receive power to witness for Christ and fight Satan, we have no alternative but to seek the experiences of the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is true that at present more and more people seek the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But to what end do they seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit and receive spiritual power?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How many seek power to show off?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How many are for making their own flesh more splendorous?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How many hope to receive power which would enable people to fall before them, saving them the labor of searching and fighting?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to see clearly what our motive is in receiving spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our motive is not in accordance with God and is not out of God, we will not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Holy Spirit of God will not rest upon the "flesh" of man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The place He rests upon is only on the spirit that God has newly created.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not to say that we may let the outer man the flesh live while asking God to baptize our inner man the spirit in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the flesh has not yet passed through dealing, then the Spirit of God will not descend upon the spirit of man, because giving power to a fleshly man will have no other result than to make him boast and become even more fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have often said that the cross comes before Pentecost; the Holy Spirit will not give power to men and women who have not yet passed through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Golgotha is the only road to the upper room of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who follow this pattern have the possibility of receiving the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Word of God says, "This shall be a holy anointing oil...upon man's flesh shall it not be poured" Exo 30:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Regardless of whether it is the most filthy or the most cultured flesh, the Holy Spirit of God cannot descend upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there are no nail prints from the cross, there can be no anointing oil of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The death of the Lord Jesus is the verdict of God upon all men in Adam: "All must die."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God waited until after the Lord Jesus died; only then did He send down the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, unless a believer experiences the death of the Lord Jesus and has died to all that belongs to the old creation, he cannot hope to see the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In history, Pentecost came after Golgotha; in spiritual experience, the filling of the power of the Holy Spirit also comes after bearing the cross.</S>
