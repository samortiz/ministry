[1]  The Son s Death in His Humanity with His Divinity through the Spirit
[2]  CHAPTER ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-10; 3:9-11, 2; Col 1:25-27
[3]  The entire revelation of the entire Bible shows us God s dispensing.
[4]  The Bible shows us that God wants to dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[5]  God chose us, predestinated us, redeemed us, saved us, and regenerated us for the purpose of dispensing and working Himself into us.
[6]  In the first section, the four Gospels, this wonderful Person was revealed as the Son of God coming with the Father by the Spirit to be the embodiment of the Triune God in Jesus Christ as God s tabernacle and God s temple, living the life of God to develop into the kingdom of God.
[7]  The Son who became flesh died and resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[8]  This is a corporate Person, and this corporate Person lives Christ unto the fullness of God, the expression of God in full.
[9]  In the third section, Revelation, we see the seven Spirits out from the Eternal One, the One who was, who is, and who is coming.
[10]  Jesus Christ, to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth v. 5 , is God the Son.
[11]  Then He died on the cross as seven items to terminate all the negative things in the universe and to release all the positive things: as the Lamb of God He died to deal with our sin and sins John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3 ; as a Man in the flesh John 1:14 , He died in the form of fallen man, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , to deal with the fallen flesh; as a man in the old creation, He died to crucify our old man Rom 6:6 ; He also died as a serpent John 3:14 to bruise the serpent s head Gen 3:15 and to destroy him Heb 2:14 along with his satanic world John 12:31 , that all His believers may have eternal life John 3:15-16 ; as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 He died on the cross as part of the old creation to terminate the entire old creation; He also died as the peacemaker Eph 2:14-15 to abolish all the ordinances and differences in living, customs, and habits between all kinds of people; on the positive side He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life John 12:24 .
[12]  THE SON S LIVING ON THE EARTH Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 7:29; 6:46; 17:8; Matt 1:18, 20; 1 Tim 3:16; Col 2:9; John 16:15a; 1:14a; 2:21; 14:10a, 11a; 17:21; 10:30; 17:22; 8:29; 16:32; 6:57a, 5:17, 19; 10:25; 5:30; 6:38; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50; 7:18; 14:7-9; Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18a; Matt 4:1; 12:28 THE WORD S INCARNATION
[13]  It does not say that Christ became flesh or that God became flesh.
[14]  Luke 1:35 and Matthew 1:18 and 20 also show us that the Son came by the Spirit.
[15]  When the Spirit entered into the womb of Mary, that was the essence of God the Father entering into the virgin.
[16]  The first item of God s New Testament economy is the Word s incarnation.
[17]  Most young boys do not like to work with their father because he may restrict them with rebukings.
[18]  But Jesus never did any work without the Father.
[19]  When this Man lived on this earth, He was the Son with the Father by the Spirit, living to set up a pattern so that man can live a life mingled with the Triune God.
[20]  We must be deeply impressed that the New Testament reveals to us a wonderful Person for the divine dispensing.
[21]  We used to think that this conception was merely the Son of God s conception, yet we have to realize that both the Father and the Spirit joined in that conception.
[22]  In human history there was only one Person who was qualified to die such a death the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
[23]  We have already said that Christ became flesh John 1:14 , and in the flesh not Christ s flesh was Satan.
[24]  The Son s death was with the Father and by the Spirit.
[25]  Yes, it was in His humanity, in the flesh, that Christ died on the cross.
[26]  When Christ was dying on the cross, He was not only the Son of Man, but also the Son of God.
[27]  We cannot say that when Christ was dying on the cross the divine nature was taken away, because the very Person who was dying on the cross, as both the Son of Man and the Son of God, still possessed the divine nature and the human nature.
[28]  After this fellowship, some may ask how God could die.
[29]  After His death in the flesh, Christ in His living spirit went probably to the abyss Rom 10:7 to these rebellious angels to proclaim, perhaps, God s victory through His incarnation in Christ and Christ s death in the flesh, over Satan s scheme to derange the divine plan note 19 2 in 1 Peter 3 Recovery Version .
[30]  While the Roman soldiers were killing Him, His resurrection was going on.
[31]  While a grain of wheat is dying under the earth, the life inside is growing.
[32]  In the last chapter we saw something concerning the Son s resurrection in His divinity Rom 1:4; 1 Pet 3:18 with His humanity 1 Cor 15:44a .
[33]  In this chapter we will see four major items concerning His resurrection: the Son laying down His life that He might take it again in resurrection, God raising Him from among the dead, the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead, and the marvelous issue of the Son s resurrection.
[34]  Romans 8:11 says, But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
[35]  Him in the phrase the Spirit of Him refers to the Triune God Who raised up Jesus.
[36]  The Triune God was there in His conception, His living, His death, and His resurrection, and these elements have all been compounded into the life-giving Spirit for us to experience.
[37]  First Peter 1:3 tells us that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.
[38]  We must realize that when Christ was resurrected we were regenerated.
[39]  We, as human beings, were all divinely sonized through His resurrection to be many sons of God to participate in His divine sonship.
[40]  Before we became part of the old creation, we were already a part of the new creation through Christ s resurrection, so we are the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection Rom 8:29 .
[41]  CHAPTER SIX THE SON S SENDING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 14:16-20, 26; 15:26; 16:7, 11, 13-15; 20:19-22 THE INITIATION OF THE SECOND SECTION
[42]  The Son s sending of the Spirit is the initial item of the second section of God s New Testament economy see chart on pages 12 and 13 .
[43]  Thus, the disciples breathing in of the Spirit in John 20 was the initiation of the second section of God s New Testament economy from Acts through Jude.
[44]  John 14:26 says, But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.
[45]  In this verse it is hard to say what the phrase in My name modifies.
[46]  Does the Father in the Son s name send the Spirit, or does the Father send the Spirit in the Son s name?
[47]  When this Spirit comes to us as the Son, He comes with all that the Son has accomplished, attained, and obtained.
[48]  In John 16:7-11 the Lord Jesus told the disciples, But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
[49]  And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
[50]  In John 7:37-39 we are told clearly that such a Spirit of life, which is the living water, was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified v. 39 . In other words, before Jesus death and resurrection such a compound Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, was not yet.
[51]  After His resurrection, He came back to the disciples as the Spirit because through His death and resurrection He finished the entire process to make the Spirit complete.
[52]  After His death and resurrection, the Spirit was completely compounded to be the life-giving Spirit.
[53]  AND THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 1:3; Luke 1:15; Acts 1:12-15; 2:1-4, 17-18; Luke 24:49
[54]  Thus far, we have seen that the Triune God became a Man who lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.
[55]  This God-Man then died a wonderful, all-inclusive death on the cross to solve all the negative problems and to release the divine life.
[56]  In resurrection He was born as the Firstborn of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 , and at the same time He brought forth many sons of God who are His many brothers 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12 .
[57]  After the Lord finished this forty day training, He had the peace to leave them, so He brought them all to the Mount of Olives where He was carried up into heaven Luke 24:51; Acts 1:11-12 .
[58]  His incarnation brought Him into a new stage, a stage for Him to live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, a stage for Him to be a man living God.
[59]  After the disciples received the life-giving Spirit breathed into them by the resurrected Christ, as life, as life-supply, and as everything related to their inner man, they all became the God-men, the men who had been mingled with God.
[60]  From His incarnation through His resurrection, He became this Spirit of breath, which is for life intrinsically and essentially.
[61]  The book of James tells us that Elijah prayed that it should not rain and it did not rain on the earth for three and a half years.
[62]  Elijah had a mantle, and that piece of clothing was his uniform, his authority, to control the heavens for God s administration.
[63]  AND THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:13; Matt 28:19; Eph 1:22-23; Rev 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6; Matt 28:18-19; Mark 16:17-18 BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST
[64]  According to His New Testament economy the Triune God, after passing through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, was consummated to be the all-inclusive, compound Spirit.
[65]  Hence, for the believers to be baptized in this Spirit is to be baptized into one Body that, as His Body, we may be joined to Him as the Head to receive His authority for the carrying out of the divine governmental administration.
[66]  The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the outpouring of the Triune God, consummated in the all-inclusive compound Spirit, by the heavenly Head upon His Body on this earth, not for life, but for administration, not as life essentially, but as power economically to carry out God s economy.
[67]  The resurrected Christ s breathing of the Spirit of life germinates us, making us the members of Christ, and the ascended Christ s baptizing in the Spirit of power, putting us into the Triune God, makes all the members of Christ one Body.
[68]  To be baptized in the all-inclusive consummated Spirit does not only put us, the believers, all together to be the Body of Christ, but also positions us to drink Him to receive the all-bountiful supply Phil 1:19 of the processed and transmitted Triune God, that we may be nourished to be the strong and active members of the Body of Christ for the carrying out of God s eternal plan.
[69]  When the Lord poured Himself out as this all-inclusive consummated Spirit upon His disciples, He accomplished the baptism in the Spirit.
[70]  Through the baptism in the Spirit, by being baptized into the Triune God, the believers were put together to form the Body of Christ, joined to Him as the Head.
[71]  Christ is the Head and we are His Body, joined together to be the great universal man.
[72]  The New Testament tells us that the exalted Christ has been given to be the Head over all things Eph 1:22 .
[73]  In resurrection Christ is life to us and in His exaltation He is power to us, not merely for preaching the gospel, but also for carrying out God s administration.
[74]  We preach the gospel to carry out God s administration to spread the kingdom of God.
[75]  In 1969 five brothers who meet with us went to a Pentecostal, charismatic meeting where there was much speaking in tongues.
[76]  AND THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT 3 Scripture Reading: Heb 6:4-5; Mark 16:17-18; John 3:3, 6; 1 Pet 1:23; 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet 1:4; Rom 8:9, 11, 16; Eph 4:6; 2 Cor 13:5; 3:18; 1 Cor 6:17; 1 John 3:2; 1 Pet 5:10 THE TASTE OF THE WORKS OF POWER
[77]  Hebrews 6:4-5 says, Who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.
[78]  In the entire book of Hebrews, the good word refers to Christ in His earthly ministry, including His incarnation, His human living, His crucifixion, and His resurrection; and the word of righteousness refers to Christ in His heavenly ministry, including His ascension, His exaltation, and all His attainments and obtainments in His exaltation.
[79]  Due to our natural understanding and our natural desire, we treasure this kind of taste of the miraculous things more than the New Testament blessings.
[80]  We must differentiate between the New Testament blessings and the miraculous things of the coming age.
[81]  Finally, we shall be like God and have the same image as God 1 John 3:2 , being changed from glory to glory 2 Cor 3:18 to enter into God s glory 1 Pet 5:10 .
[82]  The content of God s New Testament economy is a Person who is both divine and human, a Person who is both God and man, who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has consummated in the all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit imparted into us in His resurrection as life to us, and poured out upon us in His ascension as power to us that we may live the divine life to express God and move with the divine power, economically, to carry out God s economy.
[83]  AND THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT 4 Scripture Reading: Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4; 10:44, 46; 4:8, 31; 13:9; 8:14-17; 9:13-17; 19:1-7; 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24; 13:52; 8:29, 39; 13:2; 15:28; 16:6-7; 20:23, 28; 21:4, 11 GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY
[84]  Paul experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit for the first time when he was filled pletho with the Holy Spirit right after his conversion Acts 9:17 .
[85]  Then, he had the same experience again when he was filled pletho with the Holy Spirit in his ministry Acts 13:9 .
[86]  According to the record of Acts, this was Paul s second time to be filled outwardly, economically, with the Holy Spirit.
[87]  Acts 13:52 tells us that the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.
[88]  This is to be filled Gk. pleroo from pleres with the Spirit inwardly for life.
[89]  After being baptized in the Spirit, the disciples began to drink of the Spirit and become full of the Spirit.
[90]  They were filled with the Spirit again and again inwardly until they were made full of the Holy Spirit.
[91]  In Acts in addition to the outward filling of the Spirit, being full of the Spirit inwardly, and the inward filling of the Spirit, there is also the guidance of the Spirit.
[92]  Outwardly they were filled with the Spirit of power economically for them to carry out the work of God s New Testament economy, and inwardly they were filled with the Spirit of life essentially for them to live a life of the processed God.
[93]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 4, 6, 9-11, 14, 16, 23, 26-27; 15:16 MATTHEW THROUGH THE ACTS
[94]  In the first five books of the New Testament we have seen that Christ, the God-man, after entering into His resurrection, became the Spirit of life as the breath breathed into His disciples John 20:22 .
[95]  Then after His ascension, as the Spirit of power, as the wind, He poured out Himself upon His disciples.
[96]  In the Acts we see a group of people on this earth filled with the Spirit inwardly for life and outwardly for power.
[97]  You may call this Person Christ; you may call Him the Spirit of Christ; and you may call Him the Spirit of God.
[98]  It is easy to realize that the Spirit of God refers to God the Creator and that the Spirit of Christ refers to the Spirit of the Savior, but it is not easy for us to gain a deeper understanding of these terms.
[99]  This wonderful One who is so all-inclusive as the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One, who is the Triune God, dwells in us firstly to make our dead spirit life.
[100]  Such an all-inclusive Spirit to work the Triune God into our tripartite being is to make us the sons of God.
[101]  We are sinners and we were God s enemies, yet this all-inclusive Spirit is not merely making us spiritual, holy, or victorious, but divinely sonizing us, making us the sons of God.
[102]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2:10, 12, 14; 3:16-17; 6:11, 17, 19-20; 7:40; 12:13, 4, 7-11 THE SAME PERSON IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS
[103]  In this chapter, we come to the second Epistle of the New Testament, 1 Corinthians.
[104]  In this first Epistle to the Corinthians is the life-giving Spirit.
[105]  The very Christ we see in the four Gospels is now the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, in the Epistles.
[106]  The life-giving Spirit is searching Christ as the depths of God 2:10, 12, 14 .
[107]  When anything is searched, that thing is stirred up and cannot remain calm.
[108]  Without the life-giving Spirit, Christ is everything to you, but in a calm situation.
[109]  You may have the all-inclusive Christ, but the Christ in you may be nearly nothing to you because He is so calm within you.
[110]  The life-giving Spirit is also washing and sanctifying the believers 1 Cor 6:11 .
[111]  Every house, every building, needs some washing and needs some cleaning.
[112]  Even the church as the temple of God today needs the washing, and the life-giving Spirit does this washing.
[113]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 17, 18; 13:14 GROWTH IN LIFE AND TRANSFORMATION
[114]  Thus far, we have seen that the first Epistle, Romans, is on the Spirit of life, and the second Epistle, 1 Corinthians, is on the life-giving Spirit.
[115]  The third Epistle, 2 Corinthians, is on the transforming Spirit.
[116]  This shows us that under the sovereignty of the Lord, the arrangement of the New Testament books is in a good sequence.
[117]  In 2 Corinthians 3:3 we see the Spirit of the living God as the inscribing ink.
[118]  The grace of Christ is the rich element of Christ, the love of God is the rich element of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the aggregate of the rich element of Christ and God transmitted into our being practically for our spiritual enjoyment.
[119]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SPIRIT AS THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 3:14, 2-3, 5; 4:6, 29; 5:16-18, 22-25; 6:8
[120]  It is not so easy for us to see the aspect of the Spirit mentioned in the book of Galatians.
[121]  We have seen that the book of Romans talks about the Spirit of life.
[122]  By studying 1 Corinthians diligently we all can see that the Spirit there is the life-giving Spirit.
[123]  In chapter one Paul showed that God s intention is to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ, into His chosen people v. 16 . God did not have any intention of revealing the law in His chosen people.
[124]  Paul then goes on to present to them a clear picture concerning the gospel preached beforehand to Abraham Gal 3:8 .
[125]  God did not give Abraham the law but the promise, which was not only concerning Abraham and his descendants but also concerning all the nations on this earth.
[126]  This promise was initially given to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3 where God told Abraham in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed v. 3 . In Galatians 3:16 Paul shows us that Christ is the unique seed of Abraham that brings the blessing to all the nations.
[127]  The Spirit is being supplied to the believers by the hearing of faith Gal 3:5 .
[128]  THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4; 1:13-14; 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:3, 30; 6:11-12, 17; Phil 1:19-21a; 2:12-16; 3:8-9; 4:13
[129]  In the Epistles of Ephesians and Philippians we see the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father, being the consummation of the Triune God.
[130]  After the Triune God had gone through a marvelous process, the consummation came out, that is, the all-inclusive, processed, compound Spirit.
[131]  for Christ to Make His Home in Their Heart
[132]  In Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed that through the Spirit the Father would strengthen the members of the Body into their inner man, that Christ may make His home in their hearts, that they may be strong to apprehend with all the members the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[133]  When this Christ comes to make His home in our heart, He comes with all the fullness of God, and He imparts to us all the fullness of God to such an extent that we become the fullness of God, the expression of God.
[134]  Ephesians 4:30 tells us that the members should not grieve the Spirit, in whom they were sealed unto the day of redemption.
[135]  Once the Spirit gets into us, He is always with us and will never leave us.
[136]  Day after day the divine element is being added into our being and the divine mark within us is being made more striking, more evident, and God s ownership of us is strengthened more and more.
[137]  Therefore, the Spirit is the Word of God and such a Spirit is a sword, a weapon, for us to fight the battle against God s enemy to bring in His kingdom, which is the church.
[138]  This bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ is for the believers to live Christ and magnify Him Phil 1:20-21a .
[139]  To live Christ you need the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[140]  THE PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 1:8, 4; 1 Thes 1:5-6; 4:3-8; 5:19; 2 Thes 2:13-14; 1 Tim 3:16; 4:1-3; Titus 3:5
[141]  The Spirit revealed in the seven books of the Bible from Colossians through Philemon is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving, indwelling Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.
[142]  In 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 we are told that the gospel preached by the apostle was not only preached in word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.
[143]  Verse 6 tells us that the believers accepted the gospel with joy of the Holy Spirit.
[144]  This is the wonderful One, the Savior, the Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the Son, as the embodiment of the Triune God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, in His humanity and with His human living as the all-inclusive Spirit.
[145]  In 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 we see salvation in sanctification of the Spirit unto the obtaining of the glory of Christ to express God.
[146]  God has chosen us unto a particular kind of salvation, and this salvation is in the sanctification of the Spirit.
[147]  If we would be saved by the sanctifying Spirit daily, we will surely bear the glory of Christ to express God as sons of God, possessing His life and partaking of His nature.
[148]  AND THE SPIRIT OF ENVY Scripture Reading: Heb 1:2; 2:3-4; 3:7-8a; 6:4; 9:8, 14; 10:15, 29; John 1:14, 17; 3:16; 1 Cor 1:2, 9; 15:45; 2 Cor 13:14; Col 1:12; Philem.
[149]  In this chapter we want to see in the book of Hebrews the New Testament economy to dispense a wonderful Person into our being.
[150]  Hebrews emphasizes that today this wonderful One is the Spirit.
[151]  In the Old Testament God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but in the New Testament God speaks to us in the Son Heb 1:1-2 .
[152]  The opening words of chapter one introduce us to the Son, but from this time onward Hebrews refers to the Spirit.
[153]  God speaks in the Son in chapter one, but in chapter three the Holy Spirit is speaking.
[154]  The book of Hebrews tells us that this Spirit is the eternal Spirit.
[155]  Christ as the unique sacrifice offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit Heb 9:14 .
[156]  In John 1:17 we see that grace came through Jesus Christ.
[157]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:1-2, 10-12; 4:13-14; 2 Pet 1:20-21 A WONDERFUL PERSON
[158]  Thus far, we have seen that the twenty-seven books of the New Testament reveal a wonderful Person.
[159]  All the believers in Christ were chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ 1 Pet 1:2 .
[160]  The titles the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ denote that the Spirit conveys God and conveys Christ.
[161]  The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet at the time the Lord spoke this word because He was not yet glorified.
[162]  First Peter 1:11 refers to the Spirit of Christ and in verse 12 this same Spirit is called the Holy Spirit.
[163]  This Holy Spirit is the Spirit by whom the New Testament apostles proclaimed the gospel.
[164]  The Spirit of Christ helped the Old Testament prophets inwardly to search out when, where, and how Christ would die and resurrect.
[165]  Then after the accomplishment of His death and resurrection, the New Testament apostles came to preach the gospel by the same Spirit, yet it is called the Holy Spirit.
[166]  It is when you are persecuted for the Lord s sake, that the Spirit of God, which is also the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Christ, becomes the Spirit of glory.
[167]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE ANOINTING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:20-27; 3:24; 4:2, 13; 5:5-12; Jude 20-21
[168]  First John 2:20-27 unveils to us the teaching of the divine anointing for the abiding in the Triune God.
[169]  John tells us that the anointing Spirit was received by the believers from the Holy One v. 20 . John also charged us to abide in the Lord by this anointing v. 27 . If we did not have this anointing, it would be impossible to abide in the Lord.
[170]  In his heresy, he separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ, and taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him, and then He announced the unknown Father and did miracles, but that at the end of His ministry Christ departed from Jesus, and Jesus suffered death on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separated as a spiritual being, and will rejoin the man Jesus at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory.
[171]  This anointing teaches us concerning all things pertaining to the Person of Christ related to the divine Trinity.
[172]  The anointing teaches us that Jesus is Christ, that Christ is the Son, and that the Son is with the Father.
[173]  We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in our holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit v. 20 ; thus, we await and look for the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age, but inherit it for eternity Matt 19:29 . The entire blessed divine Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers in their praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping themselves in the love of God, and awaiting the mercy of our Lord unto eternal life.
[174]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE SEVEN SPIRITS 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-8 GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY
[175]  We want to stress again that our fellowship is concerning God s New Testament economy.
[176]  In the divine life, God has a family and this family is unique, universal, and eternal.
[177]  God s family arrangement, God s household administration or dispensation, is to dispense, to distribute, and to impart Himself into His chosen and redeemed people.
[178]  Him who is, and who was, and who is coming is God the eternal Father.
[179]  Concerning the first of the divine Trinity we see three modifiers who is, who was, and who is coming.
[180]  Concerning the second of the divine Trinity in Revelation, the seven Spirits, is the modifier, before the throne of God.
[181]  For the third of the divine Trinity, Jesus Christ, there are the modifiers, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, Him who loves us, who has loosed us from our sins, who made us a kingdom and priests to His God and Father, and who comes.
[182]  In God s existence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere from eternity to eternity.
[183]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE SEVEN SPIRITS 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:9-18 THE ECONOMICAL AND ESSENTIAL
[184]  In this chapter we must first see more concerning the economical and essential aspects of the Trinity.
[185]  The beginning of Matthew tells us how Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a virgin 1:18, 20 .
[186]  At the end of Matthew we see the Trinity described in a simple way as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[187]  Two great and important terms are used in the first two verses of the book of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ v. 1 and the testimony of Jesus Christ v. 2 . The revelation of Jesus Christ is Christ Himself, and the testimony of Jesus Christ refers to the church.
[188]  These two expressions refer to the revealed Christ and the testifying church and comprise the entire book of Revelation.
[189]  We see Jesus Christ again as the Witness, the Firstborn, the Ruler, the Redeemer, the One who made us a kingdom, the priesthood to His God and Father, and the One who will come.
[190]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SEVEN SPIRITS 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 2 3 THE SPEAKING ONE
[191]  Based upon what we have seen in Revelation 1, we now want to see this wonderful One in Revelation 2 and 3.
[192]  In these two chapters the most striking point is that this all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One speaks.
[193]  In the first chapter we see many titles for this wonderful One the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, the seven Spirits who are before the throne, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Redeemer, the One who made us a kingdom, priests to His God and to His Father, and the One who comes.
[194]  In speaking to the church in Smyrna He says that He is the First and the Last, who became dead, and lived again 2:8 .
[195]  THE PROMISES TO THE OVERCOMERS The Tree of Life and the Crown of Life
[196]  Now we must see His promises to the overcomers in the seven churches.
[197]  The Lord does not promise us a big mansion, a good car, a high promotion, or good children.
[198]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your New Testament economy.
[199]  How we thank You for the book of Revelation that conveys to us the picture of Your economy.
[200]  Lord, we also thank You that You have opened Your Word to us.
[201]  Thus far, we have seen three items: the throne, the One sitting on the throne, and the seven Spirits of God burning as a flame before the throne.
[202]  First, this carrying out of God s economy involves administrating the entire situation in this universe and mainly administrating the world situation.
[203]  Furthermore, in Revelation the redeeming Lamb becomes the Executor of God s New Testament economy 5:7-10 .
[204]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE SEVEN SPIRITS 5 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:9, 11-12 ISSUING IN THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS
[205]  In this chapter we want to see that the searching and infusing by the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb issue in this age in the golden lampstands 1:11-12 .
[206]  In Ephesians 1 the fullness is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all, but the same fullness in chapter three of Ephesians is the fullness of the infinite God v. 19 . In Ephesians 3 Paul prays that Christ may make His home in our hearts that we may know His dimensions, the breadth, length, height, and depth, that we may be filled unto the fullness of the infinite God.
[207]  The church as the fullness is mysterious and abstract, but the lampstands are very concrete.
[208]  After many years of study, I came to the realization that in Exodus the golden lampstand was not only a type of Christ as the light from God to man.
[209]  The lampstand is also the embodiment of the Triune God.
[210]  While we are growing with the divine element, we are being shaped.
[211]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE SEVEN SPIRITS 6 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:9, 11-12; Rom 8:9-11; 1 John 3:9; 5:1-4; Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2; 8:29; Phil 3:21 THE SIGN OF THE LAMPSTAND
[212]  We have seen that every single local church as a lampstand is an embodiment of the Triune God.
[213]  When all the local churches are put together they are the multiplication of the lampstand as revealed in Exodus 25; therefore, in this age the lampstands are the multiplied embodiment of the Triune God as the testimony of Jesus.
[214]  In Paul s fourteen Epistles he mainly taught the mystery of God which is Christ Col 2:2 and the mystery of Christ which is the church Eph 3:4 .
[215]  In the lampstand there is the crucial and vital concept that the Triune God is being wrought into His redeemed Rom 8:9-11 .
[216]  We have already seen that in order for the Triune God to be wrought into us we all need to eat John 6:57 , drink John 4:14; 1 Cor 12:13 , and breathe John 20:22 of the Lord.
[217]  The Triune God is also wrought into His redeemed by the renewing of the Spirit Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23 .
[218]  We all need the practical knowledge and experience of the renewing of the Spirit.
[219]  The lampstand as the embodiment of the Triune God is altogether a doctrine if we do not have the adequate experiential knowledge.
[220]  The renewing of the Spirit is the Spirit applying all the divine things, of which we have been born, into our being in our practical life.
[221]  God is wrought into our being first by being born into us and second by Himself as the Spirit working in us to replace our old being with Himself as the new being, which is the renewing of the Spirit.
[222]  In Revelation are the seven Spirits as the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church consummating in the golden lampstands in this age and in the New Jerusalem in eternity.
[223]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of seven main things: of the entire divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures, of the eternal purpose of God, of God s purpose in man, of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people, of the positive types, figures, and signs of the Scriptures, of the lampstands in the Scriptures, and of all the buildings of the Scriptures.
[224]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the entire divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures.
[225]  This depicts how the Triune God God, the Lamb, and the Spirit symbolized by the water of life dispenses Himself to His redeemed under His headship implied in the authority of the throne for eternity.
[226]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE NEW JERUSALEM ITS DESIGNATIONS 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3a; 2 Cor 5:17; Col 3:10-11; Heb 11:10; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:19, 20; Heb 11:11-16; 12:22; John 1:14a; Exo 26:15, 29a
[227]  We have seen that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the divine, spiritual things in the Bible.
[228]  We need to have a thorough study of the New Jerusalem since it has never been thoroughly studied and properly interpreted.
[229]  Furthermore, the New Jerusalem is constituted with Christ as the new man with the divine nature and the divine life Col 3:10-11 .
[230]  According to Colossians 3:11, the new man is constituted with Christ because in the new man there cannot be any natural man.
[231]  THE HOLY CITY Holy Separated unto God and Saturated with God
[232]  The New Jerusalem is also designated as the holy city Rev 21:2a .
[233]  In the Old Testament to be made holy is to be separated unto God.
[234]  In the New Testament, however, the church is God s temple 1 Cor 3:16 and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God.
[235]  First Corinthians 3:12 tells us that in this age, the church age, we should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones.
[236]  Gold signifies God s nature, silver signifies Christ s redemption, and the precious stones signify the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.
[237]  To God the New Jerusalem is His dwelling and to us God is our dwelling because Revelation tells us that in the New Jerusalem there is no temple for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb 21:22 .
[238]  As we have seen, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the revelations in the Bible.
[239]  The five designations of the New Jerusalem are: the New Jerusalem, the holy city, the tabernacle of God, the wife of the Lamb, and the mother of the believers.
[240]  Also, the New Jerusalem symbolizes the believers as the wife of their Redeemer.
[241]  In 2 Corinthians 11:2, Paul says, I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.
[242]  All the regenerated believers constitute the bride of their Redeemer as His increase, His enlargement John 3:3,5-6,14, 29-30 .
[243]  As a young believer I was taught in a thorough way concerning regeneration, but no one told me that the regenerated believers constitute the bride.
[244]  Gold is an element created by God and characterized by its unchangeableness.
[245]  In type in Genesis, in the actual building in 1 Corinthians, and in the fulfillment in Revelation there are only three categories of materials for God s building.
[246]  The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we have the base for God s building.
[247]  I only care how much God you have, how much divine nature you have partaken of, and how much divine nature you are partaking of day by day.
[248]  The basic elements of the structure of the New Jerusalem are the gold as the base of God s building Rev 21:18b, 21b , the pearls which signify the produce of Christ in His redemptive work with His secreting life for the entry Rev 21:21a into God s building 1 Cor 3:12a; John 3:5 , and the precious stones Rev 21:11, 18a, 19-20 signifying the produce of the Spirit in His transforming work 2 Cor 3:18 with His divine element for the building up of God s building.
[249]  THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 1:20; Col 2:9; Gen 1:26a, 27; John 1:13; 1 John 3:9; 1 Pet 1:3; 2 Pet 1:4; John 4:24; 1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5; John 1:4; Rom 8:2 THE DEFINITION OF THE DIVINE NATURE
[250]  In all the messages we have given, we have never touched in a thorough and adequate way the definition of the divine nature.
[251]  This term the divine nature is only mentioned once in the entire Bible in 2 Peter 1:4.
[252]  This verse mentions the divine nature in a very particular way in that it says that we have become partakers of the divine nature.
[253]  When this Person entered into us, regeneration transpired and we were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God John 1:13 .
[254]  We all should praise the Lord for the divine fact that we have been born of God!
[255]  The Apostle John also tells us in his first Epistle that when we were begotten of God, a divine seed entered into our being 1 John 3:9 .
[256]  As believers in the Lord, God s seed is now in us.
[257]  We all need to remember that the New Jerusalem has a base and this base is pure gold, which in typology refers to God s divine nature.
[258]  We believers have all been made partakers of this divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .
[259]  Simply speaking, the divine nature is what God is, just as the nature of anything is what that thing is.
[260]  When we touch God, we touch Him as Spirit in His Person, as love in His essence, and as light in His expression.
[261]  After touching God, we walk, we live, we have our being, in His Spirit as our person, in His love as our essence, and in His light as our expression.
[262]  In 1 John we first see the eternal life, whom John had heard, seen, beheld, and handled as the Word of life.
[263]  Then John testified and reported to us the eternal life that we may have fellowship 1:1-3 .
[264]  In his Gospel it was God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we might become His children 1:12-13 ; in his Epistle it is we the children, in the fellowship of the Father s life, coming to the Father to participate in His love and light.
[265]  John s Gospel is Christ coming to us bringing grace and truth to us, and John s Epistle is that we go back in Christ to the source in our fellowship and we touch God as love and as light.
[266]  Beef can never be your enjoyment unless you enjoy the nature of the beef.
[267]  THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:15-16, 22; 2 Pet 1:7; 3:11; 1 John 1:5-9; 2:29; 3:7 THE ISSUE OF PARTAKING OF
[268]  We have seen that when we enjoy the divine nature, we mainly enjoy God as Spirit, love, and light because these are the three main constituents of the divine nature.
[269]  When we touch the Spirit this issues in the Person of God.
[270]  If you remain in the divine fellowship to enjoy not only what God gives or what God does for you but also what God is as love in His essence and as light in His expression, you will be bathed in the love of God.
[271]  In Peter s second Epistle we also see love in holiness.
[272]  Love is the ultimate development of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:7 .
[273]  Holiness is the manner of the life partaking of the divine nature 2 Pet 3:11 .
[274]  John mentions that God is love, but he does not stress love that much.
[275]  Through this life, you have received the divine fellowship and if you remain in the divine fellowship, you will enjoy God as light 1:5-7 .
[276]  THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 5 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:11, 18-21; John 19:34; Matt 13:45-46; John 3:5; Gen 2:12b; 1 Cor 3:12a THE GREATEST ALLEGORY IN THE BIBLE
[277]  The Bible is not a book of religion, philosophy, or something invented by the human mentality, but it is God s revelation of the divine life.
[278]  The Bible, of course, covers many things but its focus and very central thought is the divine life.
[279]  Therefore, God exercised His wisdom to reveal such a mystery concerning His divine life by many allegories.
[280]  In this chapter we want to see the significance of the pearls in the New Jerusalem.
[281]  Revelation 21:21 tells us that the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are twelve pearls.
[282]  The producing of the believers as the pearls by Christ in His redemptive work is allegorized in the blood and water which came out of His side John 19:34 .
[283]  When He was dying on the cross, a soldier pierced His side and immediately there came out blood and water.
[284]  We need redemption because we are sinful, and we need regeneration which is the initiation of the secretion of Christ s resurrection life, because we are merely human and do not have the divine life.
[285]  We need the blood to wash away our sins, and we need the water as the flow of the divine life to germinate us, to bring the divine life into our being, that we may have the life power to overcome so many things.
[286]  THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 6 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:11, 18a, 19-20; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 1:19; Gen 2:12b; 1 Cor 3:12a; 1 Pet 2:4-5; Rev 4:3a GOLD, PEARLS, AND PRECIOUS STONES
[287]  Gold refers to the divine nature of God the Father, and pearls refer to the produce of Christ in His overcoming death and life-secreting resurrection.
[288]  The work of the Son is His redemptive work, of which there are mainly two aspects one aspect is to wash away all our negative things through His death and the other aspect is to germinate us, to make us alive, with the divine life through His resurrection.
[289]  Revelation 21 tells us that the city was pure gold and also that the street of the city was pure gold v. 21 . When we were regenerated, we received the nature of God and a part of this golden mountain entered into our being.
[290]  A part of our regenerated being is gold and this divine gold is God s nature.
[291]  The Spirit s transforming work is different from Christ s secreting work.
[292]  Without Christ s secretion of life, the Spirit has nothing as an element with which to transform us.
[293]  Christ secretes His resurrection life over you and following this the Spirit works to transform you with the life element.
[294]  ITS TRIUNE ENTRANCE Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12-13, 21a; Eph 2:18; Luke 15:4, 8, 20; Matt 8:11; Gal 3:24; Rev 5:9; Luke 15:7; Heb 1:14
[295]  Without such an allegory of a city at the end of the Bible with three gates on each of its four sides, it would be difficult to understand and to see the triune entrance.
[296]  This verse says, For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.
[297]  The Son came to be our channel and through this channel we get into the Spirit, and the Spirit brings us unto the Father.
[298]  The twelve gates are twelve pearls Rev 21:21a , signifying that the entrance is the produce of Christ in His redemptive and secreting work.
[299]  We have seen that the produce of Christ s all-inclusive death and all-inclusive resurrection are the pearls.
[300]  The produce of such a Christ becomes the very communication of the city, and this communication constitutes an entrance and fellowship that we may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God in every way.
[301]  AND ITS STREET Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12a, 14, 17-20, 21b; 22:1-2; 4:3a; Matt 22:30
[302]  In order to enter into the full significance of the divine allegory of the New Jerusalem, we must have a revelation of its wall, its foundation, and its street.
[303]  Revelation 21:18a tells us that the wall was built with jasper, signifying the appearance of God 4:3a for His expression.
[304]  To be transformed is one matter and to be built up is another matter.
[305]  The seventh implication of the wall is that it protects God s interest.
[306]  It is the circumference of the interest of God, which is the kingdom of God.
[307]  ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS TEMPLE, AND ITS LIGHT Scripture Reading: Rev 21:15-16, 22-24a; 22:5; Deut 33:27; Psa 90:1 ITS DIMENSIONS The Number Twelve
[308]  The dimensions of the New Jerusalem are stressed in Revelation 21:15-16.
[309]  We have seen that twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and that the height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits which is twelve times twelve.
[310]  In Revelation 21:22 John says, And I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[311]  This verse shows us that the temple is not something physical or material, but the temple is a personal temple, even the Triune God Himself.
[312]  On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is a tabernacle for God s dwelling, and on the other hand, the city is a temple for us to dwell in. The tabernacle is good for God to dwell in, and the temple is good for us to dwell in. God being the temple is not for Himself to dwell in but for us to dwell in. The New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place.
[313]  The New Jerusalem has no need of the sun nor of the moon, neither of the light of a lamp Rev 21:23a; 22:5a .
[314]  The fact that there is no need of the sun nor of the moon indicates that in the New Jerusalem there is no natural light, and the fact that there is no need of the light of a lamp means that there is no man-made light.
[315]  CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE NEW JERUSALEM ITS THRONE Scripture Reading: Rev 22:1-3, 5c; 2:7; 22:14, 17; John 7:38-39 THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB
[316]  God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan.
[317]  The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who has accomplished a full redemption to fulfill God s plan.
[318]  Do not say the source of the divine life flowing within us is in the heavens.
[319]  We have to say the source is within us.
[320]  Some may argue that John saw the throne in the heavens, but we must realize that according to Ephesians 2:6 we are now seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
[321]  In the place where the Triune God flows, we serve Him Rev 22:3 .
[322]  Not only do we serve Him but also we see His face Rev 22:4 .
[323]  His face is in the water of life and in the fruit of the tree of life.
[324]  THE TRIUNE ENTRY Scripture Reading: John 3:36a; Matt 28:19; John 15:4a; 14:17, 23; Col 2:7a; Eph 3:16-19
[325]  In order to interpret the significance of this allegory, we need the proper understanding of the spiritual revelation in the entire Bible and also the experience of all the crucial points of God s revelation in the New and Old Testaments.
[326]  Since Christ is the very embodiment of the Father and realized in the Spirit, when we live by Christ, we live by the Triune God, and when we live Christ, we live the Triune God.
[327]  In this chapter we want to specifically look at the triune entry.
[328]  According to the divine revelation in the sixty-six books of the Bible our God is enterable.
[329]  That God is righteous, holy, merciful, and faithful has been preached and taught for centuries.
[330]  Furthermore, we need to abide in the Son that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit may abide in us John 15:4a; 14:17, 23 .
[331]  Once you get into God, do not get out.
[332]  While we are rooted into Him, the Father works to strengthen us through God the Spirit that God the Son, Christ, may make His home deep down in our heart which is composed of our mind Heb 4:12 , will Acts 11:23 , emotion John 16:6, 22 , and conscience Heb 10:22 .
[333]  THE TRIUNE CONSTITUTION Scripture Reading: Rev 21:18-20, 3, 11, 22
[334]  I love this allegory of the New Jerusalem because it speaks about or depicts our experiences of Christ.
[335]  Our faith in Christ, our baptism into Christ Gal 3:27 or into the Triune God, Matt 28:19 , and our regeneration in the Spirit John 3:6b were the very initiation, the very beginning, of our Christian life and of our spiritual constitution.
[336]  The first intrinsic element of the triune constitution is gold, given by the Father as the basic element Rev 21:18b .
[337]  In like manner, when we were born of God, as the begetting Father He imparted His own nature into our being, which is the gold of the golden mountain, the New Jerusalem.
[338]  The second aspect of the triune constitution is the pearls which are produced through the secretion of Christ s resurrection life Rev 21:21a .
[339]  The divine nature was given to us by God, but pearls are produced through the secretion of Christ s resurrection life from the time that we entered into Christ.
[340]  When we stay in the death of Christ, Christ s resurrection life secretes itself over us, making all of us pearls.
[341]  THE TRIUNE EXISTENCE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; Gal 2:20a; John 6:57b; Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 12:13; John 3:6b; Rev 1:4b
[342]  We need to be reminded of our need to realize that the New Jerusalem is not just an item of prophecy concerning something coming in the future, but the holy city is altogether applicable to us today.
[343]  As we have already seen, in the New Jerusalem there are three materials for its existence: gold signifies God the Father in His divine nature, pearls signify the produce of Christ through His death and in His resurrection, and precious stones signify the produce of the Spirit s transforming work.
[344]  In business corporations people are either over others or under others.
[345]  We also need to be those existing with the Lord Christ Eph 4:5 .
[346]  Our existence today must be one with Christ in the way He lives in us.
[347]  Many of us have heard message after message telling us that Christ lives in us, yet in our daily life we do not exist with Christ living in us.
[348]  Christ living in us is a continuation of the Father being over us, and eventually in us.
[349]  We need a vision to see how we have to exist with God the Father over us, through us, and in us; with the Son living in us that we may take Him as our life to live by Him, to live Him, and to magnify Him; and we also have to see that the very consummation of the Triune God is the reaching Spirit who is right now within us.
[350]  I hope that we all have been impressed with the picture that we have seen concerning the New Jerusalem.
[351]  We should be those living with the Father as the source of life John 1:13; Eph 4:18; John 5:26 on the throne.
[352]  The first striking point of the New Jerusalem is that God is sitting on the throne.
[353]  When you have the Father, you have the Son, and when you have the Son, you have the Father.
[354]  We live with the Father as the source of life, but we live with the Son as life.
[355]  We are living with the Father as the source, as love and as light, in His fellowship of the divine life; we are living with the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God as life and as life supply for His magnification; and we are living with the Spirit as the realization of this enjoyable Christ as the Spirit of life and as the water of life for the bountiful supply of the Triune God to nourish the entire church life.
[356]  THE TRIUNE ENJOYMENT Scripture Reading: Rev 21:23; 22:5; John 1:4; 8:12; 1 John 1:5; Rev 21:11; 22:2, 14; Gen 2:9; Rev 22:1, 14, 17
[357]  The second aspect of the triune enjoyment is the river of water of life Rev 22:1 .
[358]  This river refers to the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.
[359]  John 7:38-39 indicates that the rivers of living water refer to the Spirit.
[360]  In Revelation 22:1 is the throne of God the Father and of the Lamb the Son out of which flows the river of the water of life the Spirit .
[361]  The river is the flowing of the Triune God and the consummate coming out of God.
[362]  THE TRIUNE EXPRESSION Scripture Reading: Rev 21:9-14, 18-21; 22:1-2
[363]  Since we have entered into the Triune God and are being constituted with Him, existing and living with Him, and enjoying Him, we will surely express Him.
[364]  Gold expresses God in His divine nature, pearls express Christ in His death and resurrection, and precious stones express the Spirit in His transforming work with all the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[365]  In the New Jerusalem we see the triune expression of the Father as the source of all the divine riches, of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches, and of the Spirit as the realization of all the divine riches.
[366]  The second aspect of the triune expression is the expression of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches.
