   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO LIVE BY THE LORD BEING TO LIVE AND WALK BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be crucified does not mean to suffer, as most people would say; that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be crucified does not mean to suffer, but it means to die and be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Crucifixion does not cause you merely to suffer; instead, it is to terminate you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, many Christians today do not understand what this means, and they explain that to be crucified is to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, they say that to suffer all the time is to "bear the cross daily."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Husbands, wives, and children consider one another as crosses which they have to bear, and even landlords and tenants consider one another in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church life, you consider the elders, the brothers, and the sisters as your crosses; they all appear to be joined together to give you trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this is not the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person who is truly crucified does not feel troubled, because he has no more feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, crucifixion does not make you suffer; it terminates you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of being crucified with Christ is that "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" v. 20b . I have been terminated, and now it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, I can say, "To me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This experience equals to live and walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not need to be taught how to experience this; every saved person knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every saved person knows that the Spirit is living within him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Spirit is the Lord Himself 2 Cor 3:17 living in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, to live by the Lord is to live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8:4 says, "Do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Greek, the word walk here means "live and move."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not only to move and walk but also to live.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that our living and moving should all be according to this Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To walk according to the Spirit is to live by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we live by the Lord, we abide in the Lord, and we enjoy the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we view it from this angle and understand it from this kind of experience, we can realize more the meaning of "abiding in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you reason even just a little with your spouse, then you know that you are not in the Lord because you have not lived by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is just like the lightbulb with a switch that is not securely installed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the switch is turned on, the lightbulb flickers and gets in and out of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, if your inward lightbulb does not shine but is flickering, it means that you are not in the Spirit, nor are you abiding in the Spirit; you are a "flickering" Christian who is not firmly in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to be in the Lord firmly, then your inward switch must be firm, and it must be always switched on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, you will remain in Christ as the "electricity" to enjoy His supply, and you will shine brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the proper living that we Christians should have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, to abide in the Lord is to live by the Lord in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even little things, such as combing our hair and washing our face, we should do by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We who are saved have not received merely another life within; in reality this life is a Person, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and who is the eternal living Lord abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we receive God's salvation, we should learn to let the Lord live in us, and we should allow Him to be magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we live by the Lord who lives in us, we abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah for God's salvation!</S>
