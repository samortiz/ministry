   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God puts us through many trials which other children of God will eventually experience.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we learn our lesson, we will have a word for such an occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more we yield and surrender, the more words we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such words come from submission, a submission that is learned through trials.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our very submission brings forth the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not submit, we will not have the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But as soon as we submit and prostrate ourselves, we will receive the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we fall on our face, some words will be written and inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God ordains that His children go through different kinds of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At times God's mercy allows us to go through trials which others have not yet gone through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are tried first, and then others are tried.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the trials have done their job in us, the word will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other brothers and sisters may be tried later and may come to the end of themselves, but by then we will have risen up, and we will be able to release the word that has been formed in us during our trials.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our word will become life, light, and power to those who go through the same trials after us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will once more have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must remember that all ministers of the word have to take the lead in accepting trials.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not go through any trials, we will never have any word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have not passed through a particular trial, we cannot effectively help those who are going through the same trial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if we speak, our words will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What use will these empty words serve?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The formation of the word is a process that involves fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church has to pass through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God must bring the ministers through the fire first; the fire must pass through the ministers first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have passed through the fire will have the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fire will consume them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As they are consumed by the fire, they receive a word from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They receive a word whenever they surrender to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more they surrender, the more word they have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When other brothers are under the same trial, they will have a word to render help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason we say that the ministry of the word supplies words that are taught by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean that the Holy Spirit merely speaks some words of wisdom through our mouth, but that the Holy Spirit has taught us to express the words ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are taught by the Holy Spirit, and we have learned the words to say to others by passing through the fiery furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Any speaking that involves less than this is vain and empty talk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a very basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that every dealing involves some basic lessons that we should learn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every word that we speak must be harnessed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unless our word is harnessed by fire, it will not do others any good; we will wonder what effect it has upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When others are in grief, our comfort will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No outside words will amount to anything in someone's inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can only become useful by passing through God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church has received so much help from 2 Corinthians 12 during the last two thousand years because Paul had a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank the Lord for such a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once a thorn is removed, the effectiveness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The power of 2 Corinthians 12 was manifested through the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without a thorn in Paul, the whole experience would have been void of any spiritual worth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Power is manifested in the thorn; life is manifested through the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only a foolish person will try to save himself from a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once the thorn is gone, the ministry is over, and no word will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The power of the word comes from the thorns we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ministers of the word are men chosen by God to take the lead in facing dealings and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They in turn also take the lead in their knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They minister Christ to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are able to minister to others because they are ahead of the others in their sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They can supply many because they bear more burdens than others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have no desire to be a minister of the word, nothing more needs to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But as long as we have a desire to be a minister of the word, we have to take the lead to suffer what others have yet to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to suffer more than others suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has not made us ministers of the word for the sake of just one person; He has made us ministers for the sake of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we must be ahead of many in their sufferings, and our sufferings must be greater than theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Otherwise, as an individual, we could only render help to another individual; we would not be able to help more than one person in their difficulties or trials.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The amount of riches a minister of the word releases is very much related to the amount of dealings he has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not ask God to deal with us slowly, delicately, or leniently.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As ministers of the word, we should face dealings that many will have to suffer; we should bear what many will have to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unless we do this, we will not have much to offer others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The utterance of some brothers runs out so easily because they have not received many dealings from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can trace the problem to this root.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A man must go through many dealings before he can become a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If he has experienced enough dealings from the Lord, he will have the right words when others come to him for help.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A minister of God's word must be rich in utterance, and in order to be rich in utterance, he must be rich in dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only those who are rich in dealings can be rich in utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who have gone through a wide variety of trials will be able to meet the needs of the brothers and sisters who are going through a wide variety of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, those who serve must not have passed through a few dealings; they must have passed through many dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If they can only make claim to a limited range of experience, they cannot meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people have needs, and their needs are varied.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are short in any way, we will not be able to supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This means that we need an accumulation of deposits.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must experience many trials, going through what many people will go through, before we can serve them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without this, we will not be able to serve them in any way when their problems are before us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thank God that Paul had such a great ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His ministry was great because he suffered greatly; he experienced much.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the reason his ministry was so great.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we want to have a great ministry, we should expect more dealings from the Lord.</S>
