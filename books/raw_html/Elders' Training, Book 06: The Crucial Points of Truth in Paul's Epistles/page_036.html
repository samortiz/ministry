<h2 class="head2">A Vessel unto Honor</h2>
<p>The crucial point in 2:18-22 is a vessel unto honor. Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the sure foundation to hold the truth.</p>
<p>As vessels unto honor, we need to pursue the spiritual things with the callers of the Lord (2:22). To call on the Lord out of a pure heart is to name &ldquo;the name of the Lord&rdquo; (2:19) in our prayer and praise to Him. The Lord&rsquo;s seekers must be those who call on His name. Today those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart are found in His recovery. Thank the Lord that we are with those who call on Him out of a pure heart. With such believers we may pursue the virtues of righteousness, faith, love, and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man of God with the Breath of God</h2>
<p>In 3:14-17 is a man of God with the breath of God. The Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God. God&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s breathing. Hence, His word is spirit (John 6:63), <em>pneuma,</em> or breath. Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.</p>
<p>As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s living Word (Rev. 19:13), and the Scripture is God&rsquo;s written word (Matt. 4:4). This Scripture makes the man of God complete and equips him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Word in Season and out of Season</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:2 says, &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season.&rdquo; In the original text the New Testament has no chapter divisions. Therefore verses 1 and 2 of chapter four are a continuation of 3:14-17. The word in 4:2 is the word of the Bible, comprised of what Timothy learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament (3:14-15). In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church&rsquo;s decline, the preaching of the word is vital. In 3:14-17 God&rsquo;s speaking is His breathing. We should be men of God with the breath of God. Our reading of the Scripture is our inhaling of God&rsquo;s breath. God is breathing and we are inhaling. Then we are able to preach the word in season and out of season. Our preaching is our exhaling.</p>
<p>Physically, we breathe in season and out of season, without any choice. Harvesting may be in season or out of season, but breathing is not. Even eating and drinking may be at certain times, but breathing is in season and out of season because it must take place all the time. Our preaching should be like our breathing, our exhaling, in season and out of season, which means opportunely or inopportunely whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</p>
<p>Today we have so many diamonds of the truth, yet many times we do not speak. We should be today&rsquo;s Timothys, the ones charged to commit all the rich deposit of the truth to the faithful ones, making them competent speakers to go out to speak the truth in season and out of season, anytime and anywhere. This is our heavenly breathing. Every day we should inhale God&rsquo;s breath, and every day we should exhale by speaking. This will subdue today&rsquo;s situation in which many are devoid of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deliverance from the Earthly Kingdom<br />
into the Heavenly Kingdom</h2>
<p>In 4:18 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom.&rdquo; In verse 6 Paul was expecting his imminent martyrdom for his Master: &ldquo;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom was an evil thing. Yet Paul says that the Lord will deliver him from every evil work. The Lord would deliver Paul from every evil work, but the Lord would not do this miraculously. When Paul was martyred, he was bold. That was something marvelous but not miraculous. He was not delivered from being martyred.</p>
<p>The Lord would deliver Paul to His heavenly kingdom. The heavenly kingdom here is different from the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5&mdash;7. The kingdom of the heavens there denotes the reality of the divine kingdom. The heavenly kingdom in verse 18 is the kingdom of their Father (Matt. 13:43), the kingdom of My Father (Matt. 26:29), the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in 4:8, and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course.</p>
<p>Paul knew that he was going to be martyred by the earthly kingdom, the earthly Roman empire, and that he would be rejected, killed, and cut off from the earthly kingdom. Yet, he also had the assurance that the Lord would deliver him into a heavenly empire, the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, he suffered martyrdom with no miraculous rescue. This indicates that in Paul there was no thought of something miraculous, but instead his thought was full of the spiritual, divine reality. As followers of the Lord Jesus Christ we should not expect the Lord to do something miraculous for us. But we have the full right to claim that the Lord has to do spiritual things, divine things, and heavenly things for us.</p>
