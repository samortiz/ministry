How patient our God is! He brought a people out of Egypt with the intention to build up His kingdom and His home, the temple.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why David was so pleasant to God; he was a man according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's heart was on His kingdom with His home.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this we can see that the Bible is a record concerning God's economy.</S>
