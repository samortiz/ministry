<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Looking for the Tribulation<br>Rather Than Looking for the Blessing</H2><P>If the entire church passes through the tribulation, all that the church can look forward to is the tribulation and suffering. Thus, it will be without hope. Where then is the blessed hope of the church? Will not the phrase in Titus 2:13, "Awaiting the blessed hope," become meaningless? If the entire church passes through the tribulation, it will not be awaiting the blessed hope, but will be looking forward to the tribulation. This is contrary to the principle and spirit of the Bible. This kind of concept is too much.</P><P>Those who believe the entire church will pass through the tribulation have the following additional errors in their interpretation of the Bible:</P><P>(1) They only acknowledge the open rapture. But the Lord said, "I come as a thief" (Rev. 16:15). When a thief comes, does he come with great announcement or with great ceremony? A thief comes unnoticed. Furthermore, he comes to steal valuable and precious things. The Lord will come to take what is precious to Him. But unlike the thief, who takes things that belong to others, the Lord takes only what belongs to Him.</P><P>(2) They greatly undervalue the position of the Jews. These friends who believe the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation say all the disciples at the Lord's time were Jews (positionally speaking) and none of them were Christians. This is too much. Those friends who believe that the entire church passes through the tribulation say that all the disciples were Christians; none of them were Jews. This is too short. We know that the disciples at that time carried two statuses. On the one hand, they were the remnant of Israel, and on the other hand, they were the initiators of the church. We cannot say that they were all Jews. Neither can we say that they were all the church. Those who advocate the entire church's being raptured before the tribulation negate everything; they say that no disciple was a Christian, and that all of them were Jews. Those who advocate the entire church passing through the tribulation apparently admit everything; they say that all the disciples were Christians, and none of them were Jews. But the Bible tells us they were Jews as well as Christians. If all the disciples were Christians, while none of them were Jews, we would have problems with several verses. For example, Matthew 10:5-6 says, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." This is a clear reference to their Jewish background. They were men in the transition period. We cannot dogmatically cut them apart and say that at a certain point they were no longer Jews. Another example is Matthew 23:2: "Seated themselves in Moses' seat." Is this verse for the Christian? Of course not. It is for the Jews. In the four Gospels, the Lord was, on the one hand, full of grace, but was, on the other hand, a Jew. Therefore, we cannot say that the disciples were all Jews. Neither can we say that all the disciples were not Jews.</P><P>(3) Those who hold the concept that the entire church will be raptured say that the whole of Matthew 24:23-31 is speaking to the Christians. But we ought to know that Matthew 24 is a continuation of chapter twenty-three, which says that the descendants of the Jews should all bear the responsibility of shedding the blood of the prophets. The Lord said, "Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city" (Matt. 23:34). It is evident that in the future there will still be men sent by the Lord in the land of Judea. During the great tribulation there will be prophets witnessing among the Jews. These people are Christians, yet they are also Jews; they are Jews, and yet they are also Christians. Our friends say there is only the church of Christ. They do not admit that there is a place for the Jews in Matthew 24. But in this chapter many verses refer to the Jewish believers during the tribulation, for many of them will be saved during the great tribulation.</P><P>(4) They make little distinction between the matter of Christ taking the saints and the matter of Christ coming with the saints. To them the phrase, "The Lord comes for the saints," is the same as, "The Lord comes with the saints." They say that the rapture is an open matter and not a secret. But Jude 14 says, "And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints." This refers to the Lord setting foot on the Mount of Olives. In Revelation 1:7 it says "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him." This too refers to the time of His setting foot on the Mount of Olives. They do not distinguish between these matters. This, again, is their mistake.</P><P>(5) Most of them belong to the historical school of interpretation of the book of Revelation. In the interpretation of the book of Revelation, there are two major schools, the historical school and the futuristic school. Since they are mostly of the historical school, they say that most of Revelation 4—9 has been fulfilled. The futuristic school says that nothing after chapter four has been fulfilled. Although this theory has its deficiency, in general it is correct. According to the Bible, the concept of the historical school is unacceptable because they make inferences about many of the symbols in Revelation. Many interpretations of historical fulfillments are too far-fetched. The church has a history of two thousand years, but Revelation 2—3 has already covered two thousand years. If the book of Revelation is all history, then it can only be for doctors and scholars; you and I would not be able to understand it. They treat nearly every literal record as a symbol. The blood should just be the blood; the fire should just be the fire. But they say that the blood signifies one thing, and the fire signifies another. In addition, they say that the 1,260 days signifies one thing, and "a time and times and half a time" signifies another. They say the sun, the moon, and the stars also refer to something. In this way of thinking, nearly everything becomes a symbol. We would ask one question, does the New Testament fulfill the Old Testament symbolically or literally? We know it fulfills the Old Testament literally. Bethlehem is Bethlehem, and a virgin is a virgin. For example, "Behold, your King is coming to you...mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden" are all matters fulfilled literally. Their teachings of the symbols are utterly illusory. Because they follow the historical school, they treat the entire book of Revelation in the way of symbols. This also is a big mistake.</P><P>I have mentioned just a few examples. I hope we will all see that the Bible says that the church will pass through the tribulation. The Bible, however, does not say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation. If we say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation, we do not have enough evidence from the Bible to back this up. We should remember clearly that the Bible does not say that the entire church will not pass through the tribulation; neither does the Bible say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation. These are all men's erroneous interpretations and not what the Bible says.</P>
