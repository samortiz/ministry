   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is still another sentence in Romans which is very clear on this point: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Someone in my family once said that we should give a gift to a certain doctor at the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I asked why, I was told that two months earlier my two younger brothers were sick, and they were cared for by that doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the doctor was a friend, he would not accept any money for his services.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we were to buy him something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"In that case," I said, "we are not giving him something, but returning something."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because there was a work and a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Strictly speaking, our giving was a returning of what we owed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My friends, if we had any achievements before God, whether these achievements were great or small, God's salvation to us would become a payment of debt and would no longer be grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank God that there is no one who can claim any achievements before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I, Watchman Nee, were saved by my achievements, I would never say, "God, I thank You for giving me grace."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead I would say, "God, I am saved because You have paid back Your debt."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I could proudly claim that I am saved by achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why is it that no one can save himself by achievements?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is because God wants to remove all pride from man, that man may do nothing other than thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the matter of achievements arises, grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please remember that God cannot withhold grace from man because of his wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nor can He reduce His grace to man because of his wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has to give, and He cannot reduce His giving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace is not related to wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What about achievements?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In grace there is no possibility of mixture with anything, even in the nature of achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is not God's payment of debt to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not that God owed us and that now He is paying us back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may say, "Mr. Nee, we are not so extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though we dare not say that we come to God only by our achievements, you have to believe that we need some achievements before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is impossible to have nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should do a little work, and then God can make up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will do our best, and God will make up the rest."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My friends, we cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Grace is not God's payment of a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, neither is grace God's overpayment of a debt, as if God owed you five dollars, but is now returning ten to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is like someone giving you a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not like someone patching up your torn garment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If grace is a patching up, it has lost its standing, and its nature is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let me repeat again, grace has nothing to do with achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man naturally sees that some people are better and others are worse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, he thinks that the better ones require less of God's grace and the worse ones require more of God's grace a bigger patch for a bigger hole and a smaller patch for a smaller hole.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But such a concept does not exist in the Bible.</S>
