Amen.</p><p>In this message, the second message on God&rsquo;s organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of sanctification and transformation. The first four points of God&rsquo;s organic salvation are regeneration, renewing, sanctification, and transformation. Regeneration is for us to have God&rsquo;s divine life; renewing is for us to become His divine, new creation; sanctification is for us to have His holy nature; and transformation is for us to have His divine image. Hence, first, we have His divine life; second, we become the divine, new creation; third, we have the holy nature; and fourth, we have the divine  image.This is what God&rsquo;s organic salvation will accomplish in us.</p><p>God regenerates us that we may have His divine life; this is the base of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God renews us that we may become His divine, new creation; this is the building up of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God transforms us that we may have His divine image; this is the shaping of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
