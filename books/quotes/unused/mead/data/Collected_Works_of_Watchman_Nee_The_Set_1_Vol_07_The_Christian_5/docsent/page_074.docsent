   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX 10 Issue No. 24 WHO THE ROBBERS ARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: In John 10 the Lord says, "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who are the thieves and the robbers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Du</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: The Lord Jesus is not referring to the prophets of old.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This word refers to the scribes who had been controlling the Judaistic thought for four hundred years, since the cessation of the prophets who prophesied through inspiration concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These scribes were not sent from God, but were teaching by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prophets came before the scribes, whereas the scribes came before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord is not condemning the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is referring to the scribes as the thieves and the robbers, because they stole and robbed the flock of God to cause them to listen to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BAPTISM AFTER REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: If a believer has been sprinkled and is now regenerated in his spirit, is it all right if he does not go through an immersion again?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wang</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: This question should not be asked this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You should not have asked if anyone who has been sprinkled and who has since been regenerated ought to be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The biblical baptism is one in which a person is immersed into water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sprinkling is not considered a baptism by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, all those who have been sprinkled have not yet been baptized according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your question should be, "Should a regenerated person who has not been baptized be baptized?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you ask this way, even you yourself will know what to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to your question, a man can be baptized even before he is regenerated; this is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only baptism that counts as biblical is the baptism performed after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man is not regenerated, he is not yet a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The biblical baptism is only for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can pick out any verse in the New Testament on baptism and find this to be the case.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if sprinkling could be considered a kind of baptism, an unregenerated person should not receive such a kind of sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible likens baptism to burial Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When those who once lived in sin are baptized, they are being buried.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Baptism is for the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, a regenerated person must be baptized according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the Lord Jesus had to fulfill this righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How much more should we do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the house of Cornelius was baptized in the Holy Spirit, they still had to be baptized in water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why should a regenerated person not receive the scriptural baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BAPTISM AND HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: Does the water in John 5:6-8 refer only to the water of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tsai, Tai-Chan</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer: Not only is this not referring only to the water of baptism; it has in fact nothing to do with the water of baptism at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is not the slightest hint to show us that this is the water of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Recently, some have thought that the baptismal water could heal people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps they base their belief on this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is absolutely a kind of demonic teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We warn God's children to stay away from this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the water of baptism can heal people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no such record, there is no such teaching, and there is not such an example, not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is it not too unreliable to base a teaching on healing on one misinterpreted verse alone?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE CHURCH AND THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Question: Do the words in Matthew 5:17-19 on fulfilling the law and practicing the law refer only to the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do they have anything to do with the church?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Tsai, Chekiang</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Answer: Matthew 5:17 is speaking of the Lord Jesus, not about the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one in the world can fulfill the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who try to do this are either ignorant of themselves or trying to supersede the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This fulfilling refers to the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, if a man says, "If the Lord Jesus had to fulfill the law, does not a Christian have to do the same?" he is saying that since the Lord Jesus had to redeem man from sin, the believers should also redeem man from sin!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The law in verse 19 refers to the teaching on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please read verses 1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because of the "crowds," the Lord went up to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He only opened His mouth to teach the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The disciples are the Christians Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the teaching on the Mount, which is the law in verse 19, is for the Christians.</S>
