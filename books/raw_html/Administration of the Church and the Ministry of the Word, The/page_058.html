 <h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD HAVING A MAIN POINT<br />
AND SUPPLYING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>As those who are responsible for the ministry of the word in the local churches, we should learn to have a main point and at the same time be able to supply the word in all aspects. No one should say that he can only preach the gospel. We should seek out how to lead the responsible ones in the homes and in the small groups. We must seek to have a word for these responsible brothers, and we must seek to have a word to supply all the needs of the saints.</p>
<p>We are focused in our ministry of the word. We can speak concerning Christ, the Son of God, the cross, dealing with the flesh, and other topics that supply the saints. However, we also need words that can take care of the serving ones. Although the speaking in a local church may have Christ, the Son of God, the cross, and the dealing with the flesh as the focus, there is also the need for speaking concerning other aspects. For instance, if we eat beef in the morning and in the evening, sooner or later we will be in trouble. Since human beings need nutrition from different vitamins, we need all kinds of food. Not only so, the northern Chinese like garlic, and the Westerners like coffee. Some like soy sauce, and others like vinegar with their meals. We must learn how to supply the various needs of the saints; otherwise, the saints will know only one truth, and they will become unbalanced. Thus, the church will suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>When the brothers and sisters are strong in a certain item but weak in other items, it is difficult for the church to advance. We can speak on the same point if we are ministering to many churches and not caring for only one church. If I am in Tainan for two months, I can concentrate on serving the saints the subject of dealing with the flesh. If I then go to Taichung for another two months, I can serve the saints the same thing. This is acceptable, because every church needs to learn how to deal with the flesh. But it is not acceptable to stay in one locality and speak every year concerning dealing with the flesh. Such speaking will cause the church to become unbalanced.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who minister the word need to learn to be versatile. This is similar to a military expert who is also capable of handling financial matters and a financier who is also good with educational issues. An economist who specializes in economics and knows nothing about military affairs cannot lead an army. General Tseng Kuo-fan was a literary writer, but he was able to overturn the rebellious government called the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace. He combined military tactics with politics and therefore succeeded in winning the victory. Hence, no one should say that he can speak only about the cross and specialize in dealing with the flesh.</p>
<p>Those who stress dealing with the flesh should learn to preach the gospel and to teach the brothers and sisters how to function in the meetings. We should be multifaceted; otherwise, the church will be unbalanced. A good housewife can prepare many different dishes. Even though carrots are good, she does not serve only carrots every day. Similarly, we should not speak on dealing with the flesh in every meeting. We should speak concerning prayer in the prayer meeting, concerning worship in the bread-breaking meeting, concerning service in the fellowship meeting, and concerning bearing responsibility to a small group of saints who bear many burdens in the service. In these various meetings the ministry of the word is supplementary. The main focus may be how to deal with the flesh and to know Christ, but it is still necessary to supply the word in other aspects.</p>
<p>The church should not have supplemental speaking without focused speaking. We need to take care of both. This principle applies to the Bible. No book covers only one subject. For instance, although the book of Romans focuses on justification by faith, it also has a greeting in the beginning, a blessing in the end, and many other aspects of the truth, such as presenting our bodies and receiving the saints. These aspects have nothing to do with justification by faith, yet they are attached to justification by faith, the central message. The book of Ephesians is profound, but it includes topics concerning honoring parents, submitting to husbands, loving wives, not letting the sun go down on one&rsquo;s indignation, and stealing no more (6:1; 5:22, 25, 33; 4:26, 28). This book focuses on the church being the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23), but there are many other supplemental topics.</p>
<p>In the church we are building up the Body of Christ; hence, we focus on helping people know the all-inclusive Christ, the cross, and dealing with the flesh. But our speaking should also supply the many other needs of the saints. Sometimes there is a practical need for a word of comfort or a word on suffering even though such a word is not as important as the central message. For instance, after praying in a prayer meeting for a family who was going through some trials and for some brothers and sisters who were unemployed or sick, I used the remaining ten minutes to speak concerning sufferings and trials. This comforted and encouraged the hearers. They then shared those words with their family so that the family was also encouraged and strengthened.</p>
<p>This shows that the ministry of the word should be living and multifaceted. We should never think that after giving a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, our burden is gone, and we can relax until Thursday night when we again go &ldquo;to the cross&rdquo; and speak. This is not acceptable. We must learn to be versatile to meet various needs. We might not have considered speaking on afflictions, but because we heard the prayers of the brothers and sisters in the prayer meeting and saw the tears shed for the suffering and sorrow of a family, we may realize that there is a need. Consequently, after the prayer meeting, we should rise up to share a word according to inspiration. Such inspiration is a result of daily exercise. The Spirit of God cannot move a stone. We must be constituted by reading verses or messages concerning suffering. Then when we feel in our spirit that the brothers and sisters need such a word, we will be able to comfort, strengthen, and instruct them in their suffering. This requires much preparation.</p>
<p>One does not become a renowned actor, singer, or musician overnight. One must devote his entire being in order to become successful and famous. An actor must study how to walk and how to laugh. He must learn to laugh so that his laughter touches the feeling of others. Then when he laughs on the stage, the audience will be touched with the same feeling and also laugh. When he cries on the stage, the audience will also cry. But this skill cannot be acquired in a month. He must daily spend the time to study, practice, and learn from the famous performers of the past and the present. He needs to learn from them and add his own ideas to produce something new. In this way he can create a unique style of his own.</p>
<p>I am not encouraging us to become great teachers; rather, my desire is that we endeavor to do things in a respectable manner. We should never think that because our truths are rich, we have enough content for one hundred and four weeks. If we think this way, we will become sloppy and perfunctory. Instead, we should spend time to daily consider and study the condition of the brothers and sisters and the situation of the church. We should not merely copy the messages that were given by others without studying. If we endeavor to study, we will exercise our spirit, receive a burden, and minister to people according to the need. When we exercise our spirit in a wedding meeting, we will know the need of the couple and share a word to meet the need. When we are in a memorial service, we will know whether the family needs comforting or strengthening and supply them accordingly. Such an exercise requires much preparation.</p>
<p>Our ministry of the word should have a focus, and we should be versatile. We need to learn how to minister the word to meet different needs. We should not regard this as an easy matter. When we minister the word, we must always have a focus, and we must take care of the various needs. Otherwise, our ministry will be unbalanced, and the church will suffer a great loss. Since most of the co-workers stay in one place, taking care of one locality, the ministry of the word must cover many aspects, or the church will suffer a loss.</p>
