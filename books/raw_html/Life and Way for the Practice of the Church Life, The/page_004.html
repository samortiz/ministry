<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In the New Testament</H2><P>Now we come to the New Testament. The first person we see is Christ Himself, the God-man, the Son of God incarnated as a man. But when we get into the knowledge of Him, He would let us know that there is a need for us to know the church. If you are one of those who, like Peter, know Christ as the Son of the living God, you have to realize the building up of the church.</P><P>After the Gospels, there is the building up of the church. From the second chapter of Acts to the last chapter of the New Testament, one thing is dealt with, that is, the church. The church is a man, a new man (Eph. 2:15). The church is the bride, the wife, of Christ (5:24-25). The church is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3), the temple of God (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:16-17), the city of God (Rev. 21:2), and the army of God (Eph. 6:11-12). Throughout all the generations, the church has been and still is fighting for God's kingdom.</P><P>Besides these seven items&#151;the man, the wife, the house, the tabernacle, the temple, the city, and the army&#151;there is the Body. This term is not found in the Old Testament; it is a new term in the New Testament. Ephesians 1:22 and 23 tell us that the church is the Body of Christ. We Christians are familiar with many of the biblical terms, but we probably do not know the right meaning of these terms. We may talk about the church being the Body of Christ, but I am afraid very few can tell us accurately what it means.</P><P>Actually, the Body of Christ is simply Christ Himself (1 Cor. 12:12). A person's body is the person himself. You cannot consider the person as one entity, and his body as another entity. The body is the very person; it is the main part of the person. Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is a part of Christ, even Christ Himself.</P><P>Ephesians 1:23 also tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ. The church is a great, universal, corporate vessel, a great container, to contain the very Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Triune God is the content of the church as the divine container, the divine corporate vessel. Eventually, in Revelation, the church is a lampstand (1:11-12, 20). If you took away these eleven items&#151;the man, the wife, the house, the tabernacle, the temple, the city, the army, the Body, the fullness, the vessel, and the lampstand&#151;from the Bible, it would become an empty book.</P><P>Christ is the image and life of the church. In Genesis 1 is the image of God (v. 26), and in chapter two is the tree of life (v. 9). We need the image and the life. The image is Christ Himself. The church is in the form, the image, of Christ Himself, and the life of the church is Christ Himself. Also, the church as a wife needs Christ as the Husband, the Bridegroom.</P><P>With a house, there is the need of a dweller. If you have a house and nobody dwells in it, it is an empty house. The church is the house, and Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is the Inhabitant, the Dweller. With the tabernacle and the temple, it is the same. With a city, there is the need of government, of ruling. The city needs a ruler. Who is the Ruler of the church as the city of God? This Ruler is Christ, the King of kings (Rev. 1:5; 17:14). Now we come to the need of the army. The army needs a commander, a general. Christ is the Commander of the church as the army of God.</P><P>The church as the Body of Christ needs Christ as the Head. With the fullness, there is the need of the reality. Christ is the reality of the church as His fullness. Then with the vessel, the container, there is the need of the content. Christ is the content of the church as the vessel, the container. Finally, with a lampstand, there is the need of a lamp. In Revelation we are told that God as the light is in Christ as the lamp, and the church is the lampstand, the lamp bearer, the lamp holder (21:23; 22:5). The church as the lampstand holds and bears Christ as the lamp shining with God as the light.</P>
