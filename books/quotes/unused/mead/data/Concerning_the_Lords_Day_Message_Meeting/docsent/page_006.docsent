   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word and the Anointing Being Repeated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you are living, then these things will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are dead before God, these things will become like publicly recited prayers; they will become dead things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If all of you are living, then even that which is dead will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If all of you are dead before God, even the living things will become dead, even a book as living as the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, if you are living, I believe that by speaking the things we have arranged year after year, both the words and the anointing can be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words can be repeated, and the life can also be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way you can edify the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Supply for the Gospel and</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Supply for Edification</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now you have seen that there are two meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first is the Lord s Day morning gospel meeting, stressing gospel preaching for saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once some have been saved and brought in, you must pay attention before God to give the new believers a clear leading in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s Day morning supply of the word is related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The supply of the word on Thursday or Friday night is related to edification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Supply of the Word in 1 Corinthians 14</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may ask how we should supply the older brothers, and many other brothers and sisters among us, with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the purpose of the Saturday night meeting, the meeting for the exercise of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This meeting is conducted according to 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this meeting each one has a word, has a revelation, has a hymn, has a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If today some feel that the meeting for edifying new believers is not sufficient, please remember that every Saturday night you can let several able ministering brothers take care of a stronger and fresher meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every Lord s Day morning we have to preach the gospel and every Thursday we must have the meeting for edifying new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps every Saturday night we will have an additional meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14, in which we can supply God s children with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Either one, two, or three can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Saturday night meetings have to be very living, not like today s Lord s Day message meeting, which is maintained in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting is quite hard even for a worker because if he has a word, he must speak, and if he does not have a word, he still must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also very hard for a local brother to maintain because, similarly, if he has a word, he must speak, and if he does not have a word, he also must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we do not maintain the Lord s Day message meeting today, the brothers and sisters will be scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is as if we use the Lord s Day morning meeting to bind the brothers and sisters together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that what binds them together from now on will not be the Lord s Day message meeting, but the gospel preaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What will bind them together is everyone testifying, everyone preaching the gospel, and everyone saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we get them accustomed to working, and they move to another locality, they will feel that they cannot do without the opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must give every brother the opportunity to work, lead everyone to have a habit to work, and lead everyone to have a habit to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will have a church in a locality that is very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, in a locality on every Lord s Day morning, there will be a gospel meeting with different brothers taking turns to be responsible for one or two months with some arrangement before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That will be a corporate gospel preaching, corporately leading people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When someone is saved and receives the Lord, you then may bring him to the Thursday night meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After being there for a year he will have received his basic edification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are burdened for the word and those who have a burden before God and are not passive will stand up on Saturday nights to speak.</S>
