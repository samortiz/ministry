   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A PROPER PERSON IN GOD'S WORD Scripture Reading: Gen 49:18; John 12:27-28; Rom 1:25; 9:5; 11:33-36; Eph 1:2-3; 3:21; 6:23-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All Scripture is God-breathed, but not all of the words in it are spoken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some are spoken by Satan, some are spoken by men, and some are spoken by men possessed with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" Matt 12:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord did not say that out of the abundance of the heart the hand acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that the mouth expresses what is in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man's words express his true inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The verses listed above show us the kind of people who are qualified to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD Jacob a Man Matured in Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob did not have a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But by the time he was in Egypt in his old age, he had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was the first man in the Old Testament to utter a complete discourse in prophecy Gen 49:1-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He could do this because God had wrought Himself into him and he was matured in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his prophecy in Genesis 49, he spoke about the future of the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the prophetic discourse, only one sentence was not prophetic: verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse he spoke about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While he was speaking about the future darkness and sins of his sons, he interjected the words, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These words show us the kind of person he was and the kind of heart he had.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Previously, Jacob had been a calculating person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He calculated his blessing, his wages, and his flock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He even outdid his uncle, Laban, in calculation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in his old age Jacob was no longer calculating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He only waited for the Lord's salvation concerning his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jacob had matured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His words proved that he was a matured man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a matured man was qualified to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>a Man Who Passed through the Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of the Cross and Who Was Pliable</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's prayer in John 12 shows the kind of person the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 27 He said, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The disciples had heard His messages and witnessed His acts, but it was difficult to sense His inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse, however, reveals that the Lord was pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He never insisted that God grant Him what He asked for or thought was right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I had been praying then, I would not have dared to use the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord was debating with Himself: "What shall I say?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My soul is troubled, and I do not know what to say."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He prayed for the Father to save Him from that hour, but He had come for that hour.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was an impossible request.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The time had come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What should He do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "Father, glorify Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then a voice came out of heaven and said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" v. 28 . When most men speak, they expose the uglier part of their character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it was different with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was very pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not insist and was not stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, He fully obeyed the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul a Man Who Worshipped God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In his Epistles, Paul often was not speaking God's word but his own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet his words were also inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows the kind of person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In some passages in Romans and Ephesians, Paul interjected a word of worship in the midst of his speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first part of Romans 1 may not strike us as unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But at the end of verse 25, Paul suddenly exclaimed a word of worship, "Who is blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 26 should have immediately followed the word "Creator" in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Paul came to this point, he realized that men were not worshipping the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wanted to declare that he worshipped Him, and he hastily added his word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul paused, worshipped God, and then went on with his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This shows us that there is a human element even in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans 9 has another interesting passage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verses 4 and 5 speak of Christ and His relationship to the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the end of verse 5, another word of worship is interjected: "Who is over all, God blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The main subject of this passage is not Christ but the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first part of verse 5 should have been followed immediately by verse 6, but a word of praise is inserted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this we see that Paul was a person who worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His worship was not just in a worship meeting or a meeting of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the middle of his speaking, Paul worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was qualified to speak God's Word because he knew how to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The same thing occurs at the end of chapter eleven, where Paul spoke of God's mercy for men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 32 should have been followed immediately by chapter twelve, but Paul inserted a word of worship from verses 33 to 36.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From these passages we see Paul's character.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He feared God and exalted God; he was a man taught by God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This also occurs in chapters one, three, and six of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After speaking for some time, Paul inserted a word of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was indeed a good worshipper; he worshipped God everywhere and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am not saying that we must insert words of worship into our sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you do this as a kind of performance, others will detect it; it will not be spontaneous or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Instead, it will be artificial and unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must be people who are full of worship before we can utter words that are full of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sooner or later a man's true nature will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sometimes we may pretend, but others can always see through our pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If a man sits up straight in his chair and does not slant back, you should not assume that he is a diligent and responsible person.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some people are very impatient, yet they act in a patient way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But this acting is easily exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even their pretended patience will expose their impatience.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a man does not have endurance, it does not matter how much he acts; he will still be intolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some people seem to be hasty outwardly, but they are actually not hasty at all but are quite patient inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you are a man of worship, you will worship at the critical moment, and you will utter words of worship like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Paul was also a person who blessed others.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He often began his Epistles with a word of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>"Without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater" Heb 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>A mark of spiritual maturity is the ability to bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A mature person is one who can always bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we are young, we receive blessings from others.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we are mature, we bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>NOT WHAT IS SAID,</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>BUT THE PERSON WHO SAYS IT</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today men are concerned only with the right words.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They try their best to come up with clever words and to be scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But the words they speak do not convey the persons they are.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the shallow way to release God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is not a matter of what you preach but a matter of who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is not a matter of the doctrine but a matter of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is today's problem.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In the Old Testament we read of an ass opening its mouth to speak to the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The ass might have uttered human words, but it was still an ass.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many people think that they can speak as long as their doctrine is sound.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>No, the whole issue is not whether a person can speak but what kind of person the speaker is.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Once you open your mouth, a spiritual man will detect whether or not you are a "Galilean" because your accent and tone will speak loudly of your person; you cannot hide.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The kind of person you are determines the kind of words you speak; it is useless to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>One can tell right away whether a Fukienese is speaking Mandarin or a Cantonese is speaking Mandarin.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If a man from Hsing-Hua or Amoy speaks the Foochow dialect, any Foochow native can tell right away that the speaker is not from Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The accent will identify to the listener that the speaker is a native from Hsing-Hua.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When a man speaks for the Lord, his spirit and heart flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When a stubborn person opens up his mouth, nothing but stubbornness will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When a proud person opens his mouth, only pride will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>DIGESTING AND BEING MINGLED WITH GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We must not only hear the Word and convey the Word but also live the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Of all the persons in the Bible, the two who touch me the most are Moses in Deuteronomy Old Testament and Paul in 2 Corinthians New Testament .</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>These two books convey a clear portrait of these two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Moses was not a cruel person who coldly passed on the law to men; he was meeker than all the men who were on the face of the earth Num 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Only Deuteronomy gives us a picture of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Deuteronomy is the result of a man digesting God's word and then reiterating it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Prayer: Lord, deliver us from our self-confidence and self- contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>May we learn to live in fear and trembling and in Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>May we reach maturity and know how to bow down and worship You all the days of our life, in the name of the Lord, amen.</S>
