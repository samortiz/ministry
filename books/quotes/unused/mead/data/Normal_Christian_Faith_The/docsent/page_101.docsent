   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you see it now?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Miss Lee has the genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She said, "Lord, I thank You that I am no longer nearsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason I throw my glasses away."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Mr. Nee said, "When I throw away my glasses I shall be healed." She believed that God had accomplished her healing already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what real faith demands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a faith that believes that God has accomplished and has fulfilled all His will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same principle applies to our salvation and the living of a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not hoping that God will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid some will keep hoping even after they reach hell.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither are we hoping that victory will come in another two days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we should say is, "Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank You, Lord, that it is no longer I who live, but You live within me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to believe in what is and what has been.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we do this we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>RECEIVED THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is another passage in the Bible concerning faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 11:24 should be read with care: "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The crucial word in this verse is "received."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have underlined this word in my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first clause gives the past tense, while the second is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible gives only this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is faith that believes in having received, not one that hopes to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the receiving that is through faith is the true receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the receiving in faith, there is no receiving in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes my co-workers or I would anoint sick people with oil and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often I ask a sick man, "Has God answered your prayers yet?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who have faith say, "Yes, God has answered prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My illness is gone."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of patient may still have a high fever and not look too positive, but he eventually gets well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are others who say, "God will heal me," or "I will be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to pray again for these because we detect no faith in them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What they have is not faith, but mere hope.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To hope to be healed and to believe that one is healed are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who believe that they have received will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true of victorious living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you believe that you are victorious already, then you will experience victory after victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you put your hope in the future, you can only experience victory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The past tense occupies a vital position in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is what I have and not what I want.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wanting something is a sign of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word want often blocks our prayers from being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word of the Lord is clear: he who believes that he has received shall receive.</S>
