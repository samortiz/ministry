   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULT OF SERVING IN THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITHOUT FIRST WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE LAVER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we pray to offer something to the Lord, we first need to wash our hands and even our feet in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To come to the meeting to function is actually to come into the tabernacle to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we serve the Lord in the tabernacle, we need to wash.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in the Christian life of many believers and in their service to God there does not seem to be a laver.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they come to the altar to make an offering to God, they have unclean hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They may come into the church meetings and serve without washing their hands in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of service brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason 30:21 says, Then they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be careful not to touch God s service unless we have first washed our hands in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we try to serve God in the tabernacle with unclean hands, we shall die, spiritually speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How much death there is among Christians today!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more they serve, the more death they have because they serve with unclean hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praying and serving with unclean hands brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not pray in the meetings or function, in a sense we may be somewhat living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we pray or function without washing in the laver, we shall bring death to ourselves and also spread death to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Death is the result of our trying to pray or serve without washing in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>EXPERIENCING THE LAVER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FOR THE OPERATION OF GOD S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The propitiation silver is for God s move, and the laver is for the operation of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the propitiation silver, God s dwelling place cannot be built up and it cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be a shortage of silver to make the sockets, caps, hooks, and fillets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There will not be the adequate number of persons drafted to form the army to fight for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same principle, without the laver there is no way to have the operation of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if we have God s dwelling place and all its furniture, we shall not have a way to put these things into operation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the washing in the laver, no one is qualified to serve in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is unfortunate for emphasis to be given to the altar, the table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar, but not so much to the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must experience the laver for the operation of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE LAVER IN RELATION TO THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In location the laver is after the altar, but in function the laver is before the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the priests came to minister at the altar, they first had to wash at the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They also had to wash at the laver before going into the tabernacle to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this we see that the function of the laver comes before that of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The location of the laver indicates that it comes out of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The altar was overlaid with bronze, and the laver was made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In typology bronze signifies God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The altar typifies the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the altar, at the cross, God s judgment was exercised to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Out of the judgment of God exercised at the altar, the laver was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The bronze on the altar signifies judgment, but the bronze on the laver signifies the result, the issue, of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This result is the washing power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the washing power of the laver comes out of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the New Testament, the washing power of the laver is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Titus 3:5 speaks of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse reveals that the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, is the washing power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the laver signifies the washing through the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The laver typifies the washing power of the life-giving Spirit brought forth by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The altar signifies Christ s redemption, and the laver signifies the life-giving Spirit s washing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the altar we see Christ s redeeming, and at the laver we see the life-giving Spirit s washing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this life-giving Spirit is not someone other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The life-giving Spirit is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After passing through God s full judgment and entering into resurrection, the crucified Christ became the life-giving Spirit who washes us.</S>
