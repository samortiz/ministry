   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the sixth and the last lesson book of this series of six lesson books for the summer school of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first lesson book showed us God s full salvation concerning how God saved us, the tripartite beings, in three stages for His purpose, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second lesson book showed us Christ s person and work and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third lesson book showed us the Holy Spirit and the human spirit, how the two are mingled, and how to live by the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fourth book showed us the eternal life that we have received and how to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fifth book showed us the church universally and locally and how the church is to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book explains what the Bible is, who wrote it, how it was written, the subject, the central thought, and the key sections.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It also shows us that the Bible is proven to be the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The major portion of this lesson book reveals the Bible s content, including the main topics and the content of each book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, this book shows us what our proper attitude toward the Bible should be and how we may enjoy the Bible for our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We pray and hope that you will be helped to know the Bible and to know how to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BIBLE WITHOUT MUST BE BALANCED</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To edify a person spiritually, we must help him to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the past two thousand years, Christians all acknowledge that no one can truly know the Lord without knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We human beings are not merely a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we have a spirit, we are not merely a spirit, but a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we were a spirit only, then God would need to give us only His Spirit and not the Bible; however, since we are not a spirit only, He must also give us the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spiritual inheritances God has given us are the Spirit which cannot be seen and the Bible which can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Inside of us is the Spirit, and outside of us is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christians throughout the ages can testify by experience that a proper Christian must be fully balanced in both respects the Bible without and the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two aspects must be absolutely balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any bias towards one side will result in serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Among Christians throughout the ages, some have leaned toward the Spirit within which has resulted in great errors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Still more lean toward the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seemingly they have not erred as much, yet among them there is a very serious condition of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, if there were only the Spirit within and not the Bible without, man would easily commit errors.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Conversely, if there were only the Bible without while lacking the Spirit within, man would become extremely dead, altogether lifeless, and without any vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians can be likened to a train.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There needs to be the fuel inside as its energizing power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But a train needs to have tracks outside as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is fuel within but no tracks without, the train would not be able to run.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if it runs, problems will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if there are only the tracks without, but not the fuel within, the train may be on the right track, but it cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, for a train to run, and to do so smoothly, there must be the coordination of two aspects: the inner aspect and the outer aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outwardly, there must be the regulation of the tracks; inwardly, there must be the energizing of the fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must put equal emphasis on the Spirit and the Bible; we must not neglect either matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not overlook the Spirit within, neither can we despise the Bible without.</S>
