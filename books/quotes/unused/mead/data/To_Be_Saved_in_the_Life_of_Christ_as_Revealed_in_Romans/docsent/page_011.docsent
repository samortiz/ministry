   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Light of the Judgment Seat</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must receive the believers in the light of the judgment seat of Christ Rom 14:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In receiving the believers, we surely need to exercise a certain amount of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we should not overjudge others in our unbalanced concept and in our personal preference.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are about to judge another Christian, we must realize that we ourselves have many shortcomings and weak points that need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should not judge others today according to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the believers, including us, will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should receive every believer in the light of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Principle of Love</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church life is altogether a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord has charged us with this more than strongly in John 13:34-35 and 15:12 and 17; the apostles also repeated the Lord's charge to us 1 Thes 4:9; Heb 13:1; 1 Pet 1:22; 1 John 2:10; 3:14; 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In receiving the believers, we must do it in the principle of love Rom 14:15a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever we would do and say to other believers must be based on and controlled by the divine love that we have enjoyed and continue to enjoy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not forget that all the believers are a treasure to the Lord in His affection because He has obtained them with His own blood in His love Acts 20:28; Eph 5:25b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to walk in love toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not destroy by anything the believers for whom Christ died Rom 14:15b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Kingdom Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of receiving of the believers for the proper church life is according to the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 14:17 says, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church life which is God's kingdom life today is a matter of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's kingdom life is not a matter of diet, nor of the keeping of days, nor of any kind of formality and custom, but a matter of the reality of the divine life in the Spirit of God, such as righteousness in strictness toward ourselves, peace in the all-embracing love toward others, and joy in the exulting praise toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our receiving of the believers must be in such a sphere with such an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our receiving of the believers should also be according to Christ Rom 15:5 , who did not please Himself Rom 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should take Christ as our pattern, our center, and our everything in the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not we receive someone depends on whether or not Christ has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Christ has received someone, we must receive him, as Christ also received us to the glory of God Rom 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions and Causes of Falling</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The living of the church life in a locality also involves turning away from those who make divisions and causes of falling Rom 16:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The present rebellion among us involves mainly two things: divisions and causes of falling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those involved in the present rebellion are attempting to proselytize the saints, to make them leave the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they are unsuccessful at this, they try to cause the saints to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This disappointment causes the saints to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Romans 14 and 15 Paul encourages us to be all-embracing concerning the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in Romans 16 Paul tells us to turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling v. 17 . We should be all-inclusive toward the believers, but we still need to have some discernment for the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must discern what we should receive and what we should turn away from.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of Romans are all on the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have the proper church life, we must practice according to these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, we must receive all the believers; second, we must be all-embracing toward the believers; and third, we also must exercise discernment concerning the divisive ones and those who make causes of falling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To turn away from the divisive ones and those who make causes of falling is to quarantine these divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a person in a family is sick with a contagious disease, the members of the family turn away from the infected person so that they will not be contaminated with the same disease.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they do not turn away from the infected member, they may become infected themselves and spread the contagious germs to other members of their family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that the members of the family do not love the infected member or have given him up; it simply means that the other members want to prevent the spread of the contagious germs.</S>
