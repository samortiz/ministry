   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A number of the new churches in the Lord's recovery are growing fast, but many of the older churches, which have been existing for twenty years or so, have had very little increase.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A church established in 1970 with fifteen saints may still be under fifty today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have been very busy meeting, taking care of the church, and managing the church, but it seems that there has been little result to our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason for this is that we have been short of visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christianity there is a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone is a good, fundamental pastor and speaks to his congregation every Lord's Day, he will spontaneously gain a ten percent increase through the relatives and children of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He does not need to give good sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He just needs to open up the Bible every week to say a short word to the people and learn how to go to the door afterwards to shake hands with everyone in a way that can touch their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then during the week he needs to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the way they can gain a ten percent yearly increase in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their secret to get and to keep people is to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am sharing this to show us that we are short of visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We speak too much, preach too much, and teach too much with very little visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most people are gained by face to face contact, and most are retained and built by such personal contact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's recovery began in the United States about thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time there were some real seeking ones among the Christians who were ready to receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The recovery met their need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many were gained through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, however, we are short of a new crop.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems difficult for us to gain new ones because we do not have the practice of visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to see this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not pick up the practice of visiting people and talking to them face to face, the mere teaching of the new way, the biblical way, the God-ordained way, will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only one thing works visiting people and seeing them face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christianity has built up an atmosphere of only the pastors being able to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This atmosphere annuls the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ and builds up the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of us need to rise up to visit people, contacting them with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we pick up this practice, we have the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just like in fighting with new weapons, we can win the battle for the increase of the church with the "new weapon" of visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When some of us visit people, we talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We try to gain them by gaining their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We gain people by gaining an intimacy with them, by showing an intimate concern for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we merely teach them to help their understanding, they will not follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if we visit them and become intimate with them in a proper way, we will gain them for the Lord.</S>
