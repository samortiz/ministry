   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TREASURING BEING LIKE-SOULED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul told the saints in Philippi in the second chapter of Philippians, But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be of good cheer, knowing the things concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you; for all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me in the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among all of Paul s co-workers, it seems that only Timothy was like-souled with Paul, being genuinely concerned with what he was concerned with, the things of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The situation was really trying for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could not rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that in the work of serving the Lord, it is not hard to be like-spirited, but to be like-souled is really difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we pray together in spirit, saying, Amen! and Hallelujah! we are immediately like-spirited.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when we turn to discuss the service or other affairs, we right away have different feelings and views.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that since we are in the Lord s recovery and have been in the training, we can work together like-souled and fight shoulder to shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have been in the Lord s recovery for more than sixty years, and I was with Brother Nee for as long as eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In those years, from his experience I realized that it was not an easy matter to work together as co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some entered into this work and later left.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the coordination of the work, some would always come in while others would leave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, I would like for you who are present here to be prepared in your heart and to treasure this matter of being like-souled in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that all of you will stay for a long time in the Lord s recovery, that no one will leave halfway through, but that all will follow the Lord until the end. I feel joyful for Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was faithful unto death, even death in a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To the end he did not forsake his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his whole life he met countless oppositions, attacks, and defamation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet none of these moved or changed him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, he became firmer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end he was even martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I speak these things to you to give you an inoculation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more you follow the Lord, and the more you are used by the Lord, the more the opposition and attacks will come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even the co-workers may not necessarily be like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BEING THE LORD S OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see from Revelation that not every church overcomes all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For instance, the church in Ephesus had fallen and lost the Lord s testimony because they had left their first love to the Lord Rev 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this degraded situation, the Lord called for overcomers v. 7 . By then, what the Lord cared for was not a group, but individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not consider that everyone in the Lord s recovery is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not think that all the full-timers, co-workers, or elders are overcomers either.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not necessarily so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament the Lord paid much attention to the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also paid much attention to the overcoming of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All overcomers mentioned in the New Testament refer to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Overcoming is something that has no companions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we all need to learn not to belittle others nor forsake others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are members one of another in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, we cannot hope that everyone will be overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, we must have a spirit that insists on this way even when all others forsake it, a kind of spirit that will not deviate even if situations, all the brothers and sisters, or even the whole church change.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not a proud spirit, nor a spirit that rejects others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is rather the overcoming spirit one should have in the way of the Lord, a spirit like that of Caleb and Joshua s.</S>
