   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD BEING TO RECEIVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this we see that it is through His death that the Lord gave Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If He had not died or shed His blood, He could not have any relationship with us and would not have a way to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason why He can enter into us is because He died and shed His blood and thus became edible and drinkable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now whenever we turn to our spirit, believing and receiving the Lord who died and shed His blood for us, we eat His flesh and drink His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We believe that in His body He bore our sins on the cross, that He died for us, and that His blood was shed for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's eyes, when we believe and receive the Lord in this way, we are eating His flesh and drinking His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was accomplished by the Lord's flesh and blood is now our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we believe in Him and receive Him, He enters into us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, when this happens, He is in us and in union with us, and we are in Him and in union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, to eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood is to receive the Lord Himself as our enjoyment, our life within, and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The greatest principle in eating and drinking is receiving, and the principle in receiving is union.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever you eat and whatever you drink will enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, you are united with what you eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how much we meditate on a person, he cannot come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, bread breaking is not to meditate on the Lord but to eat the Lord's body and drink His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In baptism we enter into Christ and are united with Christ, and in bread breaking we eat and drink the Lord Himself and are thus united and mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every time we break the bread, more of the Lord comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time we remember the Lord, we have a deeper union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EATING, DRINKING, AND REMEMBERING THE LORD IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past when we remembered the Lord, many of our concepts were religious and much of our remembrance was in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every time we came to the Lord's table, we contemplated His being God, His becoming flesh, His living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, His dying on the cross, His being raised in three days, His ascending to the throne, and His waiting to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We always remembered the Lord in this way we worshipped and meditated on Him in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the Lord said that He is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only when we use our spirit and are in our spirit can we touch the Lord, worship the Lord, and genuinely remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our genuine remembrance of the Lord is our receiving the Lord and allowing Him to enter into us again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord said, "This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me .This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you" Luke 22:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We eat the bread, which signifies the Lord's body, and drink the cup, which signifies the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do this in remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our eating and drinking of the Lord is our remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord does not want us to meditate on Him or contact Him with our mind; rather, the Lord wants us to contact Him, eat Him, and drink Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He was broken for us on the cross, He shed His blood and released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The bread and cup we touch outwardly signify His body that was given for us and His blood that was shed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that He has died and His life has been released from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we not only receive the visible bread and cup outwardly, but at the same time, we also touch and receive the Lord Himself in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We allow Him to come into us again, and again we gain Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said that this is to be "in remembrance of Me."</S>
