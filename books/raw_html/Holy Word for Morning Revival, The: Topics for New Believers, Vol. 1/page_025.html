<p class="bold">WEEK 4 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">1 Cor. 6:19-20 &nbsp;…You are not your own…for you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body.</p><p class="bold">2 Cor. 5:14-15 &nbsp;For the love of Christ constrains us…and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.</p><h2 class="head1">Consecration</h2><h2 class="head1">The Basis of Consecration</h2><p>After we have been born again, there is still much work for God to do in our lives, and there is also much service that we can render to God. But this calls for a complete surrender of our lives to Him.</p><p>If God requires that we surrender ourselves to Him, on what does He base His requirement?…The Bible shows that the question of consecration is settled on the ground of purchase.<sup>93</sup> First Corinthians 6:20 says, “You have been bought with a price.” Our consecration is based on this purchase of God.…God has bought us with none other than the precious blood shed by His beloved Son on the cross (1 Pet. 1:19). How great “a price” (1 Cor. 6:20) is this precious blood! God used this precious blood as the price to buy us, that we may belong to Him.<sup>94</sup></p><p>By virtue of His having bought us, the authority over our lives is neither the world’s nor our own; it is His.…In the sight of God, our consecration is not an optional matter; its legal basis is established.…The right to your life is not yours, but His, for He has acquired it by purchase.<sup>95</sup></p><p>We need to experience this basis practically in our daily life. Each time something occurs that causes us to argue with God, we must bow before Him and say, “Lord, I am the slave You bought. My right of ownership has been purchased by You. I here and now declare Your right. Even in this matter I will let You be the Lord and decide for me.”…Whenever we are confronted with the opportunity to make a choice, we should consider this basis of consecration, this purchase, as the foundation rock under our feet. We must stand securely thereon, never daring to depart  from it. If we experience consecration in such a sincere way, we have truly laid hold of the basis of consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">The Motive of Consecration</h2><p>The motive of consecration is the love of God. Whenever the Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, we will naturally be willing to become the prisoners of love and consecrate ourselves to God.<sup>96</sup></p><p>You may remember that we are told in Exodus 21 of a slave who at the end of six years’ service could have become a free man, but he declared, “I love my master…I will not go out free” (v. 5). Thereupon his master led him to the doorpost and bored his ear with an awl. By submitting to this, the slave said in effect, “For love of my master I want to be his slave forever.” He could have entered into liberty, but for love’s sake he repudiated his freedom. This is true consecration.</p><p>There is a verse which says,…“The love of Christ constrains us” (2 Cor. 5:14a). But why should we yield to the constraint of love? Because “One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised” (2 Cor. 5:14b-15). Everyone who has had a true experience of consecration has at least once, but possibly many times, known the touch of the love of God. Without that touch of His love upon us, consecration is a bitter thing; in fact, it is hardly a possibility. The security of our consecration depends upon its basis; but the vitality and sweetness of our consecration depends on its motive power, i.e., the love of God. Consecration is the effect of the Lord’s touch upon a life. You do not need to plead with a person who has known the Lord’s love to surrender to Him. Surrender is spontaneous.…When we really meet the love of God, we feel that our all must be offered up to Him; yet at the same time we feel that our richest offering is as refuse in the light of His love. Let but the love of God touch us and consecration will become spontaneous.<sup>97</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
