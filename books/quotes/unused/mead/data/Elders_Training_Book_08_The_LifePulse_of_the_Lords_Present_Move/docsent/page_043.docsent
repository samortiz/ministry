   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE ELDERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS RECONSIDERING THE ELDERSHIP IN EACH LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to fellowship some principles in the matter of handling the eldership in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord has given us a new start with a new way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A number of churches have been existing in the United States for over twenty years and the eldership has gone through very much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a good sense, it has been tested quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the past, the present elders should have some realization of the condition of the eldership in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Has the eldership in your place been prevailing?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the elders may have become a little old.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You also may have discovered some younger brothers in your locality who are not in the eldership but who may be more useful in taking care of the church s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based upon these facts, the situation of the eldership in your locality should be reconsidered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not have the time to go to every place to help the arrangement of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Almost every church in the United States has been fully established and even founded.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, in a sense the elders in each locality are quite capable of helping the eldership there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to consider the eldership in your locality according to these three points: 1 should the present elders resign or not, and is this necessary or profitable?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 are there some new ones who are younger that might be quite useful in the eldership?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 if the present elders remain all or some , do some brothers need to be added who would be helpful and useful in the eldership?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are honest and we are for the Lord s business, for the profit of the church, and for the recovery as a whole, we should have a sober consideration and proper evaluation of the need of the eldership in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You as an elder need to consider whether or not you are a real profit in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My feeling and observation regarding the eldership in your place may not be that thorough because I have not been there for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask all the elders throughout the United States to consider the eldership in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of the present elders may feel honestly, fairly, and rightly that they are not so useful in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may be that you would be more useful if you were not in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is the case and this is the feeling, it is better for you to take the initiative to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should know the situation of the church in your locality and the real situation of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You also should know if it will be profitable for you to remain in the eldership or more profitable for you to stay away from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you decide to stay away from the eldership in this light, this is something beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any kind of office or post for an organization or other concern usually has a term that goes with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The President of the United States has a four-year term, a Congressman has a two-year term, and a Senator has a six-year term.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there is no hint in the New Testament which tells us how long a brother should remain in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only point we can find is in 1 Timothy 5:19-20 which indicates that the saints could appeal the matter of a sinning elder to the appointing apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles do have the standing to deal with a wrongdoing elder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in 1 Timothy 5, however, Paul does not tell us what should be done with the wrongdoing elder after he is rebuked and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Humanly speaking, some elders who become more experienced will be more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But on the other hand, human beings may not be so strong, so healthy, or so capable for a certain post as when they were younger.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As elders who love the Lord and who love the recovery, we should consider the situation of the eldership in our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only the elders know the real situation in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church life is like a family and the elders should be the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At a certain time, a father should know whether it would be better to let his son take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The emperor of a certain country may be too old to adequately carry out his commission and duty, while his son would be more capable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether this should be done or not depends upon the emperor s decision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this matter the elders should neither be polite nor be afraid of anything, but they should be honest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This fellowship should help all the elders to reconsider the eldership in their respective localities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether we stay in the eldership or stay away depends upon the real profit of our staying or not staying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the best for the profit of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not think anyone can make this decision on your behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only you can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may have realized that there are some younger ones in your locality who are really much better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If so, you should give in. This is not a matter of politeness but a matter of whether or not the church will receive more profit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you feel that it would be more profitable for you to stay, then you have to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You all need to forget about your ambition, your politeness, or any other motives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should only take care of the profit of the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to do this by really meaning business with the Lord because we like to see that the new start in the Lord s recovery will be much blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The key and the hinge to this new start is the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regardless of how much we will be in the one accord, if the eldership is not so proper, that will be a big minus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We realize that we are not that strong, but something better could be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to admit that mostly no church is up to the standard, so let us admit our shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, according to what we have and what we are, we need to make a decision concerning what the best way is for the eldership in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some of the leading brothers have been in their locality a long time and it might be more profitable for them to go to another locality and let some new ones take the lead in the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They could go to another locality to have a new church started or go to another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then some younger ones can begin to bear the responsibility of the practical leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is also the need for some to take the lead among the Chinese-speaking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In some localities, the eldership really needs some help.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother who is in the lead may be a floating person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He may not be in his locality that much and yet he may be taking the lead there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may be more profitable for him to travel and to take care of his burden with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, the eldership in his locality will need strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The loss we have suffered in the eldership in some localities has been due to the dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some brothers may have become good elders, but they were dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Their dissenting was mostly due to their character.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They have a dissenting character.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is hard for them to be one in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Dissension has eaten up these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We would like to see them perfected, but it seems that there has been no way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a result, we suffered the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These dear brothers were the right persons in their age in their early forties and they did have a history in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I say this to warn all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all have to kill our own dissension and condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Dissension is a big eater.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It has somewhat eaten up the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may need to bring some younger brothers into the eldership, but we also need to take Paul s word in 1 Timothy 3:6 Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Novices should not bear the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This may open the door for the subtle one to seduce them into human pride.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then it will damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Not one among the eighty elders appointed in Taipei is under thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>To be under thirty is too young.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even the Lord Jesus began to minister when He was thirty Luke 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the priesthood an apprentice should be twenty-five Num 8:24 and the full priesthood is realized at the age of thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thirty is the full age for God s service Num 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47 .</S>
