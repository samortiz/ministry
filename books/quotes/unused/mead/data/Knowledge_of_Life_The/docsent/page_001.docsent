   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we know that God s desire and intention is to gain a corporate man, having His image, manifesting His glory, and possessing His authority to deal with His enemy that He Himself may gain eternal rest, yet very few know that this great desire and intention of God can only be attained through His own life.</S>
