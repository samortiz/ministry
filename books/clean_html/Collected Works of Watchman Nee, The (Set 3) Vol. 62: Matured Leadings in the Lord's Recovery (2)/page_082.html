<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 10, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7, 16-17; John 1:4, 12-13; 10:10b; 12:24; Rom. 8:28-30, 6</h1><p>Witness Lee: I still feel that Brother Nee should say something. This is why my burden is not that strong. However, I do have a feeling to say a word or two. When Brother Nee spoke a few nights ago, I had a strong feeling within myself. The brothers and sisters have not understood too much of what Brother Nee has said these days. They are still rather inexperienced in the spiritual things. They are like students who are not good at English and must start from the ABC's. Two nights ago it seemed Brother Nee could not quite release what he wanted to release in the first part of his message. Indeed, he was restricted by us. I must therefore start from something simple.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING GOD'S SALVATION FROM GOD'S PERSPECTIVE</h2><p>I was saved twenty-five years ago. My salvation was a good one. It was thorough and strong. I was not only saved from sin but from the world as well. I was not saved from the world slowly. As soon as I was saved, I was released from the bondage of the world. In spite of this, it was ten years before I began to stand on God's side to see His salvation from His perspective. Prior to this, I looked at God's salvation from my perspective. God's perspective of salvation is far different from my perspective. In the past we spoke as ministers of God's word from God's perspective. But His children view salvation from their perspective. This is because they are occupied with their own preconceived ideas. Many Christians think that the work of the ministry of the word is to see things from their perspective. This is absolutely wrong; we should turn things the other way around. We do not speak from the believers' perspective but from God's perspective. The brothers and sisters often nod their head at whatever we say, but in reality they may not have seen anything. May we drop our concepts about God's salvation and receive it from God's perspective.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO RECEIVE SALVATION</h2><p>There are two ways to describe God's salvation. The first is an ascent from man to God. The second is a descent from God to man. The book of Romans takes the first way. Chapter one tells us about a sinful man who starts climbing up from his sinful condition. This ascent continues until 8:28-30, when it reaches the peak in glory. The Gospel of John takes the second way. It starts from God and descends to man. In speaking about experience, we start from man and move upward. But in speaking about the objective truth, we start from God and move to man. In speaking about the tabernacle itself, we see the ark and then move outward to the altar in the outer court. But in man's experience, he first touches the altar and then proceeds to enter the Holy of Holies to meet God. Today we need both aspects. We need revelation that starts from God, and we need revelation that starts from man. Under normal circumstances and in the normal way, a man first receives revelation from God and then has the experience of salvation. Then he ascends to God through the revelation he has received. The problem today is that many people start from man's side. This is the reason so many are groping in the dark and cannot find God's vision and revelation.</p><p>This is like a man looking for direction; there are two ways he can take. He can use a map to find where he is and which direction he is facing. After he is clear about these, he will proceed with little difficulty and much confidence. The other way is not to use a map but to search around, asking for the way as he moves along. People who take this way end up in the wrong place easily. They can go around in circles, or they can even be heading in the exact opposite direction.</p>
