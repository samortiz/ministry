   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ham Exposing His Father's Failure</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Look at the behavior of Ham, the son of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he saw the nakedness of his father, he went out to tell Shem and Japheth 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who is not submissive in heart always likes to see authority in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ham found the opportunity to expose his father's mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This proves that he was one who did not submit to his father's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Previously, he submitted through pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he saw his father's mistake, he exposed it to his two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many brothers criticize others and delight in tearing them down because of a lack of love 1 Cor 13:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With Ham there was not just a lack of love, but a lack of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was a manifestation of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Miriam and Aaron's Reviling of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Numbers 12 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They mixed up family affairs with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God's calling Moses was singled out; Miriam and Aaron were only the helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was God's decision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The disobedience of these two was also manifested in words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we know authority, many mouths will be shut and many problems will be prevented.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we meet authority, many natural problems are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Miriam's words did not seem to be an overstepping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She only said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Has he not spoken through us also?" v. 2 . But God understood that as reviling v. 8 . Perhaps there were many words which they had not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps what was revealed was only the tip of the iceberg, a tenth of all that was there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps ninety percent was still hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as there is a spirit of rebellion in man, God will detect it no matter how many nice words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rebellion is manifested in words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A rebellious word speaks of rebellion no matter whether it is strong or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Company of Korah Attacking Moses</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Numbers 16 when the company of Korah and the 250 leaders rebelled, the manifestation was all the more in words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever they had in their heart they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They even broke out in open rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Miriam reviled, she did so in a reserved way, and as such there was still the possibility of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the company of Korah had no restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything spilled over like a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even rebellion has degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some have more of a sense of shame, and they can be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But those who have shaken off all restraints, who are completely unchecked, open the gates of Hades for themselves, and Hades swallows them up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only did the company of Korah speak in an evil way; they attacked in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was so serious that Moses had to fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How serious were such words: You take too much upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why are you lifting yourselves up above the congregation of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only recognize Jehovah in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The whole congregation is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not recognize your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are taking too much upon yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see that whoever listens only to God's direct authority, but refuses His deputy authority, is in the principle of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man submits to authority, surely he will restrict his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He will not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Acts 23 Paul was being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As an apostle and prophet he spoke in the position of a prophet to Ananias the high priest: "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall" v. 3 . But at the same time Paul was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he heard that Ananias was the high priest, he immediately softened and said, "'You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people'" v. 5 . How careful he was in his words, and how much he restricted his mouth.</S>
