   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 10:"And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And the door was shut."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually, the five foolish virgins needed the oil, and so they had to go and buy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unfortunately, when they went to buy, the Lord came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who were ready were caught up into the clouds to join Him in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord did not call these the "true" virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The question is one of being ready or not being ready.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not mean that the five raptured ones are the true virgins, while the others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many true Christians, but not many are prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The wedding feast" here is the marriage feast Rev 19:7, 9; 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The bride is the New Jerusalem, including all who are joined to God in the Old Testament age and the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 19 precedes the kingdom, whereas Revelation 21 is after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Between the two there is a period of one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be a bride is a one-time thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we know that the time of the marriage feast will be a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This thousand years is the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since after the kingdom there is still the bride, the feast lasts the same length of time as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The marriage feast is the sharing of joy with the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No one else can have this joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is why Revelation 19:9 says, "Blessed are they."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This blessedness refers to this joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blessedness in Revelation 20:6 refers to authority, which is similar to that found in Revelation 3:20-21.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word "blessed" is used seven times in Revelation 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why does Matthew 25 not use the word "bride"?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is because the bride is corporate, whereas the virgin is individual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There cannot be five brides.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The "door" here refers to the door of the kingdom, that is, the door to eating, drinking, and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"The door was shut."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not the door of salvation, heaven, and eternal life, but the door to the enjoyment of the marriage feast, was shut.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They lost the enjoyment of the marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whoever is prepared can go in, but those who are not prepared cannot go in. Not being able to go in is in itself a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11:"And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 11 we have the pleadings of the foolish virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By now they have bought the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The five prudent and the five foolish were all virgins; they all had lamps, oil, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They all went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They all slept, heard the cry, and arose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They all trimmed their lamps, and by now they all have oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only difference is time; some are faster than others in discerning the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the road to Emmaus the Lord rebuked the two disciples saying, "O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luke 24:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In like manner, the Lord rebuked Thomas in John 20:29.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The question of time is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who suffer in hell all believe in the Lord, but they believe too late.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The foolish do not redeem the time, but the wise redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are the ones who are filled with the Holy Spirit Eph 5:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, since we have to be filled by the Holy Spirit anyway, why not let it be today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why choose to wait until that time when the rapture takes place?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here we see at least two raptures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who are not yet saved will not even have the opportunity to go to the Lord to knock on the door.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only those who are saved will have the possibility of being raptured to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The difference, however, is in the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as we mature, we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, in a sense, we determine our own time of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We decide for ourselves whether we will be wise or foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 12:"But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here they are still virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To the bridegroom their relationship is still that toward the "lord."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He opens the door to us, and we enter into the enjoyment of the bliss of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"I do not know you."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many use this, together with the fact that the foolish do not have oil, as a basis to say that those five are unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How can the Lord say that He does not know the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us consider this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>1 "But He answered."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"But" means contrary to the ordinary, unexpected.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Luke 15:22 the word "but" points out the father of the prodigal son's intention, hope, and expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the word "but" here proves that the "do not know" is not a common "do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>2 The Lord knows all those who are saved 2 Tim 2:19; Gal 4:9; John 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are two words in the Greek language that mean "to know": ginosko and oida.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The former is objective, whereas the latter is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Timothy and Galatians it is ginosko, and in Matthew 25 it is oida.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>3 Oida in the Bible has these uses: to command, to praise, to approve, and to like.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>John 1:26 says, "You do not know oida ."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Jews did ginosko the Lord, but they did not oida the Lord; they did not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>John 1:31 says, "Did not know oida Him."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>John and the Lord were cousins; hence, naturally, they ginoskoed each other, but there was not the deeper knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>John 8:19 says, "Know oida neither Me."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Jews, on the surface, ginosko the Lord very well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The meaning here is that the Jews do not approve or accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Luke 13:22-30 depicts the situation in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They ginosko the Lord the most, for they drank and ate in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They also heard His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Yet the Lord said that they were workers of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"Unrighteousness" should be translated "lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The knowing in 1 Corinthians 16:15 is oida, a knowing even of the household matters.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the word is oida.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In that verse there is the meaning of trusting; hence, it is subjective knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>4 Matthew 10:32 and Luke 12:9 refer to matters that take place before the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The same is true of Matthew 12.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Christian who believes in secret is not lost, but in the kingdom he will not be commended by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In Matthew 26:70 the Greek word for "know" is oida, while that for "deny" is arneomai.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Arneomai also means "reject, overthrow" v. 72 . I do not oida the man; hence, I arneomai him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I do not oida; therefore, I deny that is, I overthrow, I reject .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Hence, "I do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Matthew 10:33 speaks of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It does not refer to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Those who do not testify will also be arneomaied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>5 The Old Testament also speaks of oida 1 Sam 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Samuel already objectively ginoskoed Jehovah, but he did not subjectively oida Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>6 The reward of the kingdom is altogether righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>For the Lord not to acknowledge them is also an aspect of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The tone is like that of a judge judging his son; he must ask for his son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>"I do not know you" here carries the sense of honoring only the subpoena but not the person.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is also the sense of not caring and not accepting.</S>
