<p>The first four seals are one group. Following this, verses 9 through 11 speak of the fifth seal. At this point the time is near to the end of this age. The souls of the martyred saints underneath the altar cry out, saying, &ldquo;How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo; (v. 10). This does not take place exactly at the start of the tribulation but very close to that time. These martyrs have been very patient, waiting for a long period of time until the four horses will have almost finished their race. Because the Lord has not yet avenged their blood, they are still crying out.</p>
<p>These are the souls of the martyrs who were killed for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. They are not yet resurrected; they are still <em>underneath the altar.</em> The altar is a type of the cross, which was set up on the earth. Hence, <em>underneath the altar</em> must indicate a place somewhere under the earth. This is the Paradise mentioned in Luke 23:43 and pictured in 16:22-26. The souls of the righteous ones, the martyrs, are now in Paradise waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s avenging.</p>
<p>To be underneath the altar also has another meaning. To be underneath the altar is to be a drink offering, poured out before the Lord upon the altar, as Paul was (Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6).</p>
<p>When the fifth seal is opened, the end time is very close; it is very near to the time of God&rsquo;s avenging. Therefore, the Lord told the martyrs to rest yet a little while (Rev. 6:11). Moreover, the Lord gave each of them a white robe. The color white indicates justification; the martyrs are justified in the eyes of the Lord. However, they have to wait until the number of their fellow slaves who are about to be killed for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is completed. We have to believe that more will suffer death for the Lord before His coming. In particular, more will be killed during the time of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIXTH SEAL&mdash;<br />
THE SHAKING OF THE EARTH AND HEAVEN</h2>
<p>When the sixth seal is opened, there is a change in the signs of the universe (vv. 12-17). The heaven changes, including the sun, the moon, and the stars, and there is a great earthquake. There will be two calamities of the shaking and changing of the earth and the hosts in heaven. The first will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation (vv. 12-14; Joel 2:30-31; Luke 21:11), and the second will occur after the great tribulation (Matt. 24:29-30; Joel 3:11-16; Luke 21:25-26). What is covered in the sixth seal is the first calamity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIONS INSERTED<br />
BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH SEALS</h2>
<p>It is a help in reading the book of Revelation to realize that there are insertions between certain chapters. Chapter seven is the first insertion, between the sixth and seventh seals. Therefore, chapter eight actually continues chapter six.</p>
<h2 class="head2">144,000 of the Twelve Tribes Sealed</h2>
<p>Revelation 7:1-8 speaks of the one hundred forty-four thousand of the remnant of Israel, who are sealed by God. In principle, when we read Revelation we need to apply the things in it literally, unless doing so does not give the proper meaning; in that case, we should interpret them symbolically. This portion of chapter seven should be understood in a literal sense. These chosen and sealed Israelites do not refer to Christian Jews. The believing Jews are reckoned as members of the Body of Christ and are not to be considered among the Jewish people. Even among the Jewish people, however, there will be a certain number who truly will be serving God at the end of this age. They also will be the people of God.</p>
<p>In verses 1 to 3, the four angels holding the four winds of the earth are given the order not to harm the earth, the sea, or the trees. Later, as a result of the first four trumpets, the earth, the sea, and the trees are damaged (8:7-9). Before the Lord judges the world with the damage of the four trumpets, however, God will be mindful of those among the Jews who have the fear of God, and He will care for them by sealing them.</p>
<p>The number of those sealed is one hundred forty-four thousand, which is twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes. As we have seen, twelve is three times four, indicating the mingling of the Triune God with humanity. Twelve is also the number of eternal perfection and eternal government. The one hundred forty-four thousand does not include the entire nation of Israel, because the tribe of Dan is not represented among them (vv. 5-8). According to Ezekiel 48:1, however, in the coming millennium Dan will still be counted among the tribes of Israel. The one hundred forty-four thousand here includes only the remnant of the Jews who truly fear God. Before the judgment of the four trumpets, God will preserve these few from the coming calamities.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
