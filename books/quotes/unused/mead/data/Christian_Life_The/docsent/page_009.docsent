   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The processed and consummated Triune God is revealed in John 14:6-20.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These fifteen verses are the very center of this divine autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They bring us to the center of this person whose autobiography is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We say that Christ is the center of the Divine Trinity, expressing the Father and being realized as the Spirit, based upon these fifteen verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I learned from others that the Son expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I did not learn from others that the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I discovered this in the divine revelation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Christian life is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His autobiography is our biography.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is the Triune God's autobiography, and before we experience it, it is our biography.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But after experiencing it, it becomes our autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our Christian life, we Christians are all writing our autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are writing our autobiography by copying what is written in God's autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the apostle Paul's autobiography was just the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God as a wonderful person is the contents of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He exists from eternity to eternity, having no beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As such an eternal One, He created the universe and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After His creation of man, He remained the same for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day in time, He entered into a long "tunnel" to get Himself processed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That long tunnel, or long process, lasted a little more than thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After passing through such a process, He became different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before those thirty-three and a half years, He was only divine, not human.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after those thirty-three and a half years, He became both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, before that process He was only God, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after that process, He became both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, some particular element was added into Him, and that particular element was humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before His incarnation, He had divinity, but He did not have humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was in incarnation that He picked up humanity and put humanity upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His resurrection He brought this humanity with Him, and He uplifted this humanity to make this humanity a divine humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now in His ascension, He is both divine and human, having both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are the basic elements of His person, and these basic personal elements are the basic contents of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His process He passed through incarnation, and He also passed through a living that lasted over thirty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one can fathom the mysterious human living of this God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was the very Triune God, Elohim Hebrew Gen 1:1 , who created the universe, coming to pick up humanity and living in this humanity on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who can imagine this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most Christians have never spent time to muse on God's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to consider such a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God became a man and lived in His humanity on this earth continually for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He never left during this period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we take vacations, but He never had a vacation in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His human living is a great element of what He is today.</S>
