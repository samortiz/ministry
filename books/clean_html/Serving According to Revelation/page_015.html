<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR DESIRE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:8; Judg. 5:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:31; 14:1, 12, 39; 1 Tim. 3:1</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the desire we should have in serving God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>Those who know the principles in God&rsquo;s work know that He needs people to work with Him. In order for God to give grace to man or work in man, there must be someone who works and cooperates with God. This is a principle revealed in the Bible. If no one works or cooperates with God, He will not have a way to give grace to man or to work in man. God&rsquo;s desire for man can be carried out only if He finds someone on earth to cooperate with Him. God&rsquo;s intention concerning His work in man can be carried out only if He finds someone on earth who will work with Him.</p>
<p>When God wanted to speak to the children of Israel and to work among them, He first asked Isaiah, &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo; (Isa. 6:8). Although God had already decided to speak to the children of Israel and to work in their midst, He had to find someone on earth who would work with Him according to His mind. God is still calling and looking for people. He wants to preach the gospel unto the uttermost part of the earth so that all the nations could receive His salvation (Matt. 28:19; Acts 1:8; 13:47). However, He must first find and gain people on the earth who will cooperate with Him and work with Him according to His mind. As long as there are those who are of the same mind as God and who are willing work with Him, God&rsquo;s work will be carried out on the earth by them. If God cannot find such ones on the earth, His desire and plan will remain in heaven, but it will not be carried out or fulfilled on the earth. God can carry out on earth what He has planned in heaven only when He finds people who will cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s principle is not that man would wait for God to work but that He would wait for man to work. God has done everything that is necessary to carry out His work. The problem is that man is not ready. It seems as if we are waiting for God to work, but God is waiting for us to cooperate. God wants to save people on the earth, but He needs to find those who will cooperate and work with Him. God is always ready. As soon as He finds someone to cooperate and work with Him, He immediately begins to carry out His work on the earth. This is proved by our experience and by the past centuries of church history.</p>
<p>We often hope that God would come and work on earth. We have the mistaken concept that we need to petition Him to work. God has a desire to work on the earth, but He has been waiting for us to work with Him on the earth. God wants to spread His gospel all over Taiwan. He wants to have a church in every city in Taiwan. There is no need for us to petition Him to be willing to do this. God is willing to spread the gospel unto the uttermost part of the earth and to disciple all the nations (Acts 1:8; Matt. 28:19). &ldquo;The uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;all the nations&rdquo; surely include the residents of Taiwan. God has been waiting for a long time to spread His gospel across Taiwan. But whom can He send? Who is willing to go for Him? God still has this question, and He is still eagerly inquiring, &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo; May we hear His voice and respond to His desperate need.</p>
<p>The problem related to God&rsquo;s work on the earth is entirely with us, not with Him. God has prepared everything. He is waiting for us to cooperate with Him. The amount of work that He can carry out depends on how much cooperation we render Him. The strength with which He will carry out His work depends on the degree of our cooperation with Him. Whether He will be expressed through us depends on how much we will cooperate with Him. If our cooperation is weak, His expression will be weak, but if our cooperation is strong, His expression will be strong. His work depends on us and is limited by us. The extent to which His desire can be fulfilled on earth depends on how much we cooperate with Him. His desire is limited by whether we are of one mind with Him. How we need to be of one mind with Him and have His desire in order to meet His need and render Him adequate cooperation! May many among us be one with Him in His inward parts to care for His desire. May many among us have great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart for His work in Taiwan so that He would have a free way among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HOPE</h2>
<p>I hope that we would be aggressive in several items. First, we need to be aggressive to establish bread-breaking meetings in ten localities this year.</p>
<p>Second, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel. We should begin with the big cities and continue until we reach the small villages. We hope to spread the gospel throughout Taiwan so that every person can hear the gospel of the Lord.</p>
<p>Third, churches need to be established. I hope that in five years every city and town will have a church established with believers serving God, preaching the gospel of the Lord, and maintaining the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Fourth, the local saints need to be ushered into the responsibilities of the church. The local saints who have a heart for the Lord should be given ample opportunity to learn how to serve in the church so that they can bear the responsibility of the various services of the church. The responsibilities that are currently being borne by saints from other localities should gradually be transferred to the local saints. By so doing, the local saints will become the base of the churches and will continue to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in a strong way when the nonlocal saints leave. This will free the nonlocal saints to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and go to other places when they are discharged of their responsibilities in a church. I hope that in five years the primary responsibilities in the churches in Taiwan will be borne by the local saints. In order to achieve this, the local saints must endeavor to pursue spiritual growth, and they must be aggressive to learn how to bear the various responsibilities in the church.</p>
<p>Fifth, we need to intensify the training of the saints in the church services. We need to lead many people to salvation, to love the Lord, and to pursue spirituality, and we also need to train them to be useful in the church services. I hope that within five years many saints will have been trained and will have learned the lessons in church service. Then in the future these saints will be able to raise up churches, administrate churches, and serve the churches; they will be able to manifest their spiritual function.</p>
<p>The points mentioned above are our hope, not our plan. May this hope match the Lord&rsquo;s desire, and may the Lord fulfill our hope on the earth according to His will in heaven.</p>
