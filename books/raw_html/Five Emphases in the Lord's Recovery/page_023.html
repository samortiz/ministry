<h2 class=head1>GOD MOVING IN THE CHURCH AND THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2><p>God moves in the church and through the church. We are in such a church. Today God is moving in and through the church to Eastern Europe and Russia.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S PRESENCE, BLESSING, LIGHT, GRACE, LEADING, DEALING, STRENGTHENING, ESTABLISHING, AND BUILDING BEING ALL IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>God’s presence, blessing, light, grace, leading, dealing, strengthening, establishing, and building are all in the church. God’s presence is God Himself. God’s presence is in the church. We can enjoy God’s presence in our homes when we call, “Lord Jesus,” but this cannot compare to our enjoyment of the Lord’s presence in the church. In our home our enjoyment of the Lord’s presence is a small, individual portion. However, when we come to the church, we have a feast. This feast is like a Chinese feast with twenty-four courses. In the church we enjoy the Lord’s exhaustless presence. We also enjoy the fullness of His blessing, light, grace, leading, dealing, strengthening, establishing, and building.<h2 class=head1>AS CHRIST IS THE BELIEVERS’ LIFE, SO THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THE BELIEVERS’ LIVING</h2><p>As Christ is the life of the believers, so the church should be the living of the believers. Christ is our life; the church is our living. We should live Christ in the church.<h2 class=head1>THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO LIVE CHRIST, WORSHIP GOD, AND SERVE OTHERS IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>The believers should live Christ, worship God, and serve others in the church. Our living Christ is in the church, and our worship to God is in the church. Our service rendered to others is also in the church. We have to practice such a church life.<h2 class=head1>EVERYTHING OF THE BELIEVERS BEING FOR THE CHURCH AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Everything of the believers should be for the church and especially for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:4b-5, 12). Every part of our being must be for the church. Whatever we have and whatever we are, including things such as the way we dress and cut our hair, must be for the church and its building up. We should pursue after the excelling gift of prophesying, because prophesying can build up the church, the Body of Christ. We must pursue the excelling gift of prophesying to make the church excellent.
