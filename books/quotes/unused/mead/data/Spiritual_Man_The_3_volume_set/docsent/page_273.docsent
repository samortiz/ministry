   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the believer is enlightened and begins to seek freedom, evil spirits will pour out many accusations in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They will say that he is wrong in this and in that.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There will be all kinds of condemnation, blame, and accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These will cause the believers to be too occupied to go onward to regain the ground given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They know that the believer has already been enlightened and that there is no way to deceive him again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, they will continue to accuse him, saying, "You are wrong; you are wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At such times the believer will seem to sink into a kind of pit of sin and have no way to rise up again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if the believer recognizes these as the devil's lies and wholeheartedly resists them, he will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Experience has taught us one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the believer understands the reality of the situation, knows that he has lost the sovereignty in his mind, and wants to rise up to regain this sovereignty, evil spirits will engage in a final struggle within and cause the believer to suffer torment several times more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this moment, evil spirits will again resort to their habitual lies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They will tell the believer that he can no longer be free, that he has already fallen too deep into passivity, that God is no longer willing to grant mercy, that it is best if he does not resist, allowing the situation to remain as it is, and that there will never be a day when he will be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he does not need to fight and cause himself to suffer in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believer must know that he does not live by the grace of evil spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if it means death, he should still gain his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no person who is so passive that he cannot obtain deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is always for him, and he can be freed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the believer understands the reality of the situation, when he knows that his own mind has never been completely free from the bondage of the powers of darkness, and when he knows that he should fight against evil spirits to break down all their strongholds, he will see that the weapons for this warfare must be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything of the flesh will be of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will see that repeated resolutions are not enough and that methods of training the mind or memory will not enable him to gain freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since his mind has been chained by supernatural powers, weapons of the flesh cannot drive them out or destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Very often, a believer realizes the degree to which the powers of darkness have occupied his mind only when he wholeheartedly wants to understand the spiritual truth not the opinions in his mind regarding the truth and is prepared to fight against the evil spirits to regain the lost ground.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this time, they will rise up to guard the ground that they have already gained; the believer will also see how muddled, passive, and slow his own mind is, and how completely beyond his own control it is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will also see that evil spirits have utilized many means through his mind to torment him and prevent him from acting to regain the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will see that his mind is truly the stronghold of the enemy and that he has never fully had control over it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this moment he will also see the methods that the enemy used to prevent him from understanding the truth that his mind wanted to know because he was able to remember unimportant things, but not able to understand or remember the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may sense a kind of resistance in his mind against the truth to which he has previously consented.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now is the time to begin to fight for the freedom of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is the believer willing to be the stronghold of Satan permanently?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who should solve this problem?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Should it be God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It should not be God; it should be man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The believer must choose and see whether he wants to fully consecrate to God or allow his mind to become the leasing ground of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Will the powers of darkness be allowed to utilize his mind?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Will all kinds of thoughts coming out of the pit be allowed to pour out from this part of a saved person?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Will they be allowed to fill his mind with the fire of hell?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Will they be allowed to utilize his mind to spread their teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Will they be allowed to utilize his mind to slander God?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Will they be allowed to control his mind, gaining access to freely go in and out?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Will they be allowed to oppose God's truth through his mind?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Will they be allowed to torment him through his mind?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The believer must make the choice himself!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The question is whether or not the believer is willing to be a puppet of evil spirits permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believer himself must choose; otherwise, there is no way to be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that the believer has some confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a question of whether or not the believer is truly opposing the evil spirits' attacks.</S>
