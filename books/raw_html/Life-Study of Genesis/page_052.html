<H2 CLASS=HEAD6>f) The Case of Joshua and Caleb</H2><P>The principle is the same in the case of Joshua and Caleb. They fully followed the Lord (Num. 14:24). The Lord Himself testified that Caleb fully followed Him. Thus, they defeated the enemy (Num. 14:6-9). When they followed the Lord, they had the image. Then they were in the authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>g) The Cases of the Judges</H2><P>I like Judges 5:31. This verse says that during the time of the judges, there were some who loved the Lord. They who loved the Lord shone as the sunshine. So they defeated the enemy. Whenever a certain person shone as the sun, there was victory over the enemy and rest for the entire nation. The whole book of Judges is a book of repetition. Whenever there was one who loved the Lord and shone as the sun, there was victory through him. The whole nation enjoyed rest through him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>h) The Case of David</H2><P>David was a man after God's heart. If you read 1 Samuel 13:14, you will see that originally Saul was the king. However, Saul did not have a heart after God. He lost the throne, and God found another man who was after His heart. This one, David, doubtless had the image of God. It was he who defeated the enemy (1 Chron. 22:8a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>i) The Cases of the Kings</H2><P>We have seen the priesthood. Now we come to the kingship. Whenever the kings were one with the Lord, they defeated the enemy (2 Chron. 14:2-14). Whenever they were not one with the Lord, they were defeated. They lost the authority. In other words, whenever the kings were in the image of God and expressed God, they had authority to defeat the enemies. We have now both the priesthood and the kingship. Never forget that the priesthood is for the image and that the kingship is for the dominion. Now we are priests to be like God and, at the same time, we are kings to represent God, exercising His authority over the enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>j) The Case of Daniel</H2><P>Daniel was a captive in Babylon, a waiter in the king's palace. Yet, he lived a holy life, a life that expressed God (Dan. 1:8). Thus, he came into power. He had authority over the world at that time (Dan. 6:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>k) The Case of Jesus</H2><P>When Jesus was on this earth, He expressed God. Wherever He was, He expressed God. He was a real man and a typical man, but He continually expressed God. So, He obtained authority over everything (Matt. 28:18). Zechariah 6:13 tells us that Jesus bears two posts, the priesthood and the kingship. He was the priest and He was the king. Today, He is still the High Priest and is still the King of kings. He is the One who expresses God, the One who represents God. He bears God's image and He holds God's authority. This is Jesus.</P>
