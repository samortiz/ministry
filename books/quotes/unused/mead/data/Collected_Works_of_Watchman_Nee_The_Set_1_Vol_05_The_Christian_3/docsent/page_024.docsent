   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All these speak of the Protestant church being like Sardis, living in name, but dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's description of their being living in name and dead in reality is a moral description of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the same time, it is a condemnation of their sin of nationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is possible that there is more to the Lord's rebuke, but at least it encompasses these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the eyes of these persons, what is there is not the church of God, but a Christianized world in which Christ is scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have received some truths.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is, of course, better than the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, their method of organization has put shame to the truth they preach.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their goal is not to be separated from the world, but to join the world to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do these things only to create a more proper atmosphere for the end time to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Men can put on a cloak of Christianity, but they are "lovers of self, lovers of money,...unthankful, unholy,...having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's commandment concerning these people is "from these also turn away" 2 Tim 3:1-5 , but not many people practice this command.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not much difference between the Protestant organization and the worldly social organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At this time the former is slightly more improved than the latter, but in the end both will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This, of course, is something that the world welcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as there are some political machineries behind it, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's word becomes useless, other than to serve as a text for fables.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The creeds and the constitutions of the church have become the standard of faith and conduct in the Protestant denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is authoritative are the creeds and the regulations rather than the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if someone is able to prove the unscripturalness of some church constitutions or creeds, these predetermined creeds and constitutions cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When such things happen, the only result will be a twisting of the Bible to justify the record of the creeds and the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be an officer or a nominal member of a denomination, one has to abide by the creeds and ordinances established by the founder of that denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man's establishment is to be respected, and the Bible suffers loss.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the principle of work in the many Protestant denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit has also become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The universities and the seminaries are now able to produce the preachers and the pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The overseers and the senior pastors are now able to ordain preachers and pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The nominal members are now able to hire preachers and pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need for the gift of the Holy Spirit anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as a man has the desire, he can be sent to school to learn to do the work of preaching, and if he lacks the money, he can sometimes be subsidized to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as one passes the vote, or passes the examination by a committee, he can be ordained a pastor, even though he may not have any calling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as the members of a church have enough money, they can hire a capable and eloquent man to be the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one cares about the commission of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may say, "For human beings to manage the church enterprise is bound to error.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we have to do our best!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But my friends, the suffering is self-inflicted!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where does it say in the Bible that we should take care of the church enterprise?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is Christ the Head of the church who ordains, commissions, and supplies through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These works are within His jurisdiction; others cannot substitute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you try to overrun Christ's position and take over His work, you will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even Christians have become useless in such an organization!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every citizen born in the country where this church is becomes a Christian at birth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once they have registered their names and have learned the lessons and partaken of the Holy Communion, they become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other than these things, there is no standard as to who is a Christian and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Other than a procedural admittance into the religion, there is no taste to have any other tests, for to do so is not only troublesome procedurally, but it demands a proper spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet many times, we still come to beseech this beleaguered and grieved Holy Spirit, asking Him to breathe the breath of life into the dead congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if the Holy Spirit is to work, He is only allowed to work within the confine of the committees, the executive meetings, the constitutions, regulations, and ceremonies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, man will consider the Holy Spirit contentious and divisive!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The strange thing is that in the history of all Protestant denominations, all divisions occur right after a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the soul is close to God, it will treasure His word, and one can no longer be a faithful servant of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can the new wine be put into the old wineskin?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although man tries to expand his own denomination by means of revivals, more revivals result in divisions than in unions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, the Holy Spirit is not for confusion but for peace and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nowadays, man considers the leaving of the denominations as a division, but those who say this should know the meaning of the word "division."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible speaks of "division in the body" 1 Cor 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can this body be a certain denomination?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When man replaces the Bible with the creeds, joins the living to the dead, and comes under great church leaders instead of coming under God's name, the Holy Spirit will draw a clear line between what is of man and what is of God, between the dead and the living, and between man's authority and God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Often He would take out many fresh and forgotten truths from the treasure house of His word and would test to see if His people are still honoring His word and acknowledging His place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The old and familiar truths will, of course, not be able to stir up the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The test of godliness is in the fresh truths.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Fresh truths demand fresh recognition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fresh price may be great.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is to make the giver and the receiver withstand the tide of the age so that they would be separated from the drifters in the world.</S>
