If the brothers and sisters know how to listen, they will eliminate much improper speaking. Many improper words are running rampant because many people like to listen to them. As long as there are those who like these things, they will find an outlet. There are so many defiled, evil, gossiping, dividing, double-tongued words because there are those who want to hear these words. Man's heart is evil, crooked, and unclean. As long as there are those who want to hear these things, there will be those who speak these things. If we, as God's children, want to know the kind of words we can or cannot say, we should first know the kind of words that we should and should not hear. We cannot make our ears a trash can and allow unclean things to be dumped into us. We have to reject the defiled, unclean, and corrupting words and not allow them to lodge in us.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you hear any improper speaking, you must not be distracted by it; instead you should say, "I don't want to hear it!" If you do this, you will stop many sins and help many people. Some people have a lust to listen to these things. This causes these words to multiply more and more, and more and more people will have an interest in them. Brothers and sisters, when someone speaks some inappropriate words, you should either walk away silently, which will kill his interest in continuing, or tell him clearly that such words are unbecoming to a Christian, which may stop him immediately. Many words are like fire from Gehenna; one must quench them the minute they start, before they begin to spread. When many troubles arise, those who speak bear the major part of the responsibility, while those who listen bear a minor part of the responsibility. Man has a lust for idle words; he craves strange things. If we can deny this lust, we will quench many fires from Gehenna. When someone says something bad, we should say, "Sorry, as a Christian I cannot listen to this kind of speaking." Once we take a stand this way, we will stop these words. If we intently listen while others are speaking enthusiastically about certain things, hoping that they speak more so that we can hear more, we are not quenching the fire; rather, we are adding fuel to the fire. We are making the fire burn stronger.</p><p>Psalm 38:13-14 says, "But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; /And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth./Indeed I am like a man who does not hear/And in whose mouth there are no reproofs." Many people should behave like deaf men. When others speak improper words, we should be like deaf men, hearing nothing. Many times we have to learn to be deaf and to ignore these words. Words are a great temptation, and we have to learn to overcome them. If we listen to unclean and vain words less, we will sin less and avoid much trouble.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to be disciplined in our words; we have to learn to speak, and we have to learn to listen. We have to learn to fear God in the matter of our words. This is a great matter and a very particular lesson. We should learn this lesson properly. This is not something that comes cheaply; we have to put in much effort before we can build up a habit of speaking accurately. Speaking accurately is not easy. The minute we slip a little, our words err and our motives veer. Sometimes we may be right in the things we say, but our motive is to mislead others. This is lying. Therefore, we must pay attention to this matter and put considerable effort into dealing with this matter.</p><p>Psalm 141:3 says, "Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips." We need this kind of prayer: "O Lord, guard my tongue so that I will not speak carelessly." Perhaps we should add another word: "O God, guard my ears so that I will not listen carelessly." We must reject all fruits of corruption. We should not give any opportunity for the poisoning stench to spread. We must not allow the tongue to carry us into looseness, ungodliness, and rebellion. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we learn to speak as well as listen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
