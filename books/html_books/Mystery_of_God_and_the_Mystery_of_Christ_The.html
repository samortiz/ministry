<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California. The first seven messages, which cover various aspects of our experience of Christ as the mystery of God, were given from December 4 through 11 of 1962. The last two messages, which reveal that God&rsquo;s desire is to gain the church as the mystery of Christ, were given on January 22 and 24 of 1963. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9-11; 5:32; Col. 2:2; 1:27; 1 Tim. 3:15-16</h1>
<p>At the opening of this message we would like to consider several key verses from the New Testament. Ephesians 1:9-10 says, &ldquo;Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; This verse contains the phrase <em>the mystery of His will.</em> The mystery of God&rsquo;s will is according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself. In addition, this purpose is unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ.</p>
<p>Chapter three verses 9 through 11 say, &ldquo;And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; These verses repeat three words that were used in 1:9-10&mdash;<em>mystery, economy,</em> and <em>purpose.</em></p>
<p>Chapter five verse 32 also uses the word <em>mystery.</em> This verse says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; In this universe there is a great mystery. This great mystery is the mystery regarding Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:2 also speaks of a mystery&mdash;the mystery of God. This verse says, &ldquo;That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; In this verse we see that God has a mystery and that this mystery is Christ.</p>
<p>Chapter one verse 27 states that there is a mystery among the Gentiles: &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; What is this mystery that is among the Gentiles? It is Christ in you. Christ within us is a mystery.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 mentions yet another mystery&mdash;the mystery of godliness: &ldquo;But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; Verse 15 speaks of the church as the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. What is the truth? The truth is God Himself. God in Christ is the truth (John 14:6). Christ is the truth and the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The mystery of godliness spoken of in verse 16 is related to the church mentioned in verse 15. What is the great mystery of godliness? It is God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>There are several words and phrases in these verses that are of particular importance. The first is the word <em>purpose.</em> This word can also be translated <em>plan.</em> God has an eternal purpose, an eternal plan. In eternity past, before anything existed other than God, God made a plan. Thus, this plan begins with God. This is the view presented in the books of Ephesians and Colossians. Romans begins with sinful man on the earth, but Ephesians and Colossians begin with God and present a view from eternity, from the heavens, and from another realm. Ephesians reveals that God made a plan in eternity past for eternity future. This is the plan of the ages, the eternal plan. Do we know what this plan is? Do we know what God planned in eternity for eternity?</p>
<p>Another key word in the verses mentioned above is <em>mystery.</em> Again and again, these verses speak of a mystery. In particular, they refer to the mystery of God and to the mystery of Christ. What is the mystery of God, and what is the mystery of Christ? Moreover, what is the difference between the two? Are these two mysteries or one mystery? Are these simply synonymous terms?</p>
<p>Another important word mentioned in the verses above is <em>economy.</em> This word, which is often translated as <em>dispensation,</em> is difficult to define. The word <em>
economy,</em> or <em>dispensation,</em> refers to an arrangement, an administration, or some sort of business. What do the Scriptures mean by the expression <em>the economy of God</em>?</p>
<p>The final phrase that we will highlight from these verses is the expression <em>head up all things in Christ.</em> This expression can also be translated <em>sum up all things in Christ.</em> What does it mean to sum up or head up all things in Christ?</p>
<p>All of these key words and phrases, and the answers to all these questions, reveal what God planned to do in eternity past. In this message we will focus on one of these critical phrases&mdash;<em>the mystery of God.</em></p><h2 class="head1">GOD BEING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>God is a mystery. To our limited human knowledge, understanding, and senses, God is a mystery. We believe in God, but we have never seen Him. We feel His presence, yet we cannot touch Him. We know that He exists, yet He is hidden and invisible. God is truly a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>God is a mystery, and God has a mystery. What is the mystery of God? The mystery of God is Christ (Col. 2:2). All that God is and everything that He has in Himself is in Christ. All the riches, all the divine nature, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwell bodily in Christ (v. 9). Christ embodies everything that God is and everything that God has.</p>
<p>In light of this we must ask, &ldquo;Who is Christ, and what is in Christ?&rdquo; The Gospel of John functions to answer these questions. The Gospel of John begins with Christ as the Word and proceeds to reveal that Christ is the Lamb, the way, the reality, the life, the resurrection, the Spirit, the bread of life, the living water, the good Shepherd, the door, the vine tree, another Comforter, the Bridegroom, our habitation, the light, the love, the Son of God, the Son of Man, and many other items. All these items are the elements of God. Where is God? He is in Christ. What is God? He is what Christ is. What is in God? He is everything that is in Christ. Christ is the mystery of God. We can know who God is because He is manifested in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ. Without Christ, we could never know what is in God. All those who believe in Judaism or Mormonism believe in the existence of God. They do not, however, believe that God is in Christ. As a result, they can never meet God, and they can never know who God really is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</h2>
<p>As Christians, we believe in God, and we believe that God is embodied in Christ. We know also that Christ is our way, door, habitation, food, water, resurrection, and life. However, how much do we enjoy and experience Christ as all these things day by day? Do we experience Christ as our way and our door, or are these just doctrines to us? Do we experience Christ as our habitation? Do we abide in Christ? Do we have the daily experience of taking Christ as our food? In the old days, when Chinese people saw someone that they knew, they did not say, &ldquo;Good morning, how are you?&rdquo; Instead, they would say, &ldquo;Have you eaten yet?&rdquo; This is a good question for all of us. Have we eaten Christ today? Have we experienced Christ as our food? We also need to experience Christ as our light. What is our condition&mdash;are we in the light or in darkness? It is not enough to know that Christ is the embodiment of God as so many items. We also need to experience and enjoy Christ day by day.</p>
<p>Often when we see the saints, we can tell from their faces whether or not they have been eating Christ. Recently I spoke with a brother who I could tell had not been eating Christ. I asked him, &ldquo;Brother, do you know that the Lord is the resurrection and the life?&rdquo; He answered me, &ldquo;Yes, I know this. The Lord told us this.&rdquo; Then I asked this brother, &ldquo;But do you really know what it means that the Lord is the resurrection and the life?&rdquo; The brother answered that he did know this. Then I said to him, &ldquo;Brother, I do not believe that you know what it means for the Lord to be the resurrection to us. I can tell from the look on your face that you are very depressed. You look as though you are still in the grave.&rdquo; Then the brother answered me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have to sympathize with me. These past few days have been very difficult for me. I have had many troubles both in my business and with my wife. Without the Lord&rsquo;s help, I would have been done in by now.&rdquo; After hearing this, I told this brother, &ldquo;If you truly realized that the Lord is the resurrection, you would see that you have been resurrected and that you are out of death and out of the grave. As a result, you would praise the Lord. You would declare, &lsquo;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! All my troubles can never crush me because Christ is my resurrection.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then the brother received the revelation from the Lord and began to jump up and down, declaring, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Now I see what it means for the Lord to be my resurrection. I have been resurrected out of death and out of the grave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid that for most Christians all these items of who Christ is are just points of doctrine. They believe that Christ is life, light, and many other things, but they do not know Him as these things in their experience. Recently I asked a sister what it means for Christ to be our life. She told me that when she faces some trouble, she hands her problems over to the Lord and asks Him to take her troubles away. According to her understanding, this is what it means for Christ to be our life. Is this understanding correct? What does it mean to experience Christ as our life, as our lamp, as our habitation, and as so many items? To experience Christ is to experience God, for Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<p>At the end of each day we should be able to state the specific ways in which we experienced Christ that day. We should ask ourselves, &ldquo;How have I experienced Christ today?&rdquo; We do not need more doctrine. We need to experience Christ more. Do we know Christ in an experiential way? Christ is the bread of life. Have we experienced Him in such a way? Christ is the light. Have we experienced Him as our light today? Anyone can understand doctrines, but Christ is not a doctrine. He is a living person. Every morning we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, give me some experience of Christ today. I pray that today Christ would be my hope, my life, and my light. Grant me this day some definite experiences of Yourself.&rdquo; There is much teaching in Christianity, but there is not enough experience of Christ. Christ is a reality, and we can experience Him.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I would like to tell you a little story about myself. In July of 1937 Japan attacked China, beginning a war that would last until 1945. Just as this war was beginning, I was traveling in northern China. In October I went to Hangkow, and while I was there, I received a cable from my family, asking me to return to Chefoo. Since Hangkow is far to the north of Chefoo, to return home would require me to travel along four or five different railway lines. This would be very dangerous because during the war, the Japanese were conducting daily bombings on the railway stations and lines in China. As a result of this bombing, there were many refugees up and down the railway lines and at the stations, and the trains were often not on time. Although this was the situation, after much prayer I felt that I should return home to Chefoo. I did not want to leave my family under the care of the brothers and sisters any longer but felt that I should return home to take care of them while the war was taking place. When I told the saints in Hangkow of my decision to go to Chefoo, they all were very concerned. They repeatedly said to me, &ldquo;Look at the map. Look at the map. How will it be possible for you to make it all the way to Chefoo from Hangkow in such a dangerous situation?&rdquo; Nevertheless, I still felt that I should go.</p>
<p>I must testify that while I was traveling on that trip, I experienced Christ as my habitation. I did not feel that I was in a train or being carried by a train but that I was in Christ and being carried by Christ. I remember well the events of one night on the train. That night the sky was filled with clouds and it was raining. Because of the weather, all the people on the train were very happy. They knew that as long as the sky was covered by clouds, the Japanese bombers would not be able to see the train, and they would be safe. The people on the train were so happy that they even began to sing. Suddenly, however, the weather changed&mdash;the sky became exceptionally clear and the moon came out. When the people on the train realized this, they became exceedingly anxious. They were so afraid that the Japanese bombers would bomb the train. When the train stopped at a station, they became even more frightened. That night, while everyone around me was filled with anxiety, I was filled with praise. I was experiencing Christ as my habitation.</p>
<p>After a while, I began to speak with the other people on the train. I said to them, &ldquo;Friends, why are you all so afraid?&rdquo; They answered me in surprise, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know why? Don&rsquo;t you know that the Japanese bombers may come at any minute and bomb the train?&rdquo; I said to them, &ldquo;Yes, I know this quite well. I know this as well as you do.&rdquo; Then they said to me, &ldquo;If you also know this, why are you so happy? How are you able to be happy when we are in such danger?&rdquo; I answered them, &ldquo;I am so happy because I have Christ. I have Christ; therefore, I have peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later all the people on the train were still very anxious, so I spoke to them again. I said, &ldquo;I realize that all of you are still very anxious, but I would like to let you know that I have prayed to my Christ, and He has told me that nothing bad will happen to us. Be at peace.&rdquo; When the people on the train heard these words, they said to me, &ldquo;Sir, you are very deep in religious matters.&rdquo; I answered them, &ldquo;It is not that I am deep in religious matters, but that I have the living Christ within me.&rdquo; Finally after a very long time on the train, we eventually arrived at our destination in Chefoo. As I was leaving the train, I saw the people who I had been speaking with earlier. When they saw me, they all began to say, &ldquo;You were right! Your prophecy was correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason I share this testimony with you is so that we all will realize that we can experience Christ. Christ is not only for our doctrinal understanding but for our experience. When we read that Christ is the door, we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Have I experienced Christ as my door? What does this mean?&rdquo; When we read that Christ is the way, we should consider whether or not we have experienced Christ as our way. When we experience Christ, we experience God. As a result, we realize who God is. Christ is the manifestation of God for our experience. God planned in eternity past that He would be manifested through Christ and that through Christ He would be experienced by man. In God&rsquo;s eternal plan Christ is the mystery of God. We must experience and enjoy this Christ day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />
IN THE MIDST OF TROUBLING SITUATIONS</h2>
<p>In the past year I have stressed the experience of Christ very much. With one group of young people, I pointed out two hundred and sixty-seven aspects of who Christ is for our experience. However, the more I emphasized our need to experience Christ, the more difficult my personal situation became. When I went to the Lord to find out why this was the case, right away there was an answer within me. The Lord seemed to say to me, &ldquo;This is the only way that you can experience Me more. If you are going to tell people that I am the resurrection, you must experience Me as the resurrection, and the only way that you can experience Me as resurrection is to pass through death.&rdquo; For a long time the Lord dealt with me very much so that I would experience Him as the resurrection.</p>
<p>When we pass through difficult and perplexing times, when we do not know how to deal with our situation, this is the best time for us to experience Christ. When our situation is full of trouble, and there seems to be no way out, at this very moment the Holy Spirit is working within us to point us to Christ as the way. Through our troubling situations and the working of the Holy Spirit within us, we experience Christ as our heavenly way. This is what the children of God and all people need. If we experience Christ first, then we will be able to bring others to know Him in such an experiential way. Christ is the mystery of God to be experienced and enjoyed by us. This is God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD IN COLOSSIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:13-19; 2:2-3, 6-9, 16-17, 19; 3:3-4, 9-11, 15-17; 4:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR VERSES IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>In this message we would like to consider several of the major verses found in the four chapters of the book of Colossians.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:13-19 says, &ldquo;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins; who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this series of verses there are fourteen main points. The first point is that God has transferred us out of the authority of darkness&mdash;the kingdom of Satan&mdash;into the kingdom of the Son of His love. We have not only experienced some kind of inward change, but we have been transferred from one realm into another realm, from one kingdom into another kingdom. The second point is found in the title <em>the Son of His love.</em> This refers to the Lord Jesus, who is the Christ. Christ is the Son of God&rsquo;s love. The third point is that Christ is the image of the invisible God. The Son of God is the image of the invisible God. He gives the invisible God a visible image. The fourth point is that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. This means that in all creation, Christ is the first man. The fifth, sixth, and seventh points go together. The fifth point is that in Christ all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth; the sixth point is that all things were created through Christ; and the seventh point is that all things were created unto, or for, Christ. All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. The eighth point is that Christ is before all things. This means that Christ existed before all other things came into existence. The ninth point is that all things cohere, subsist, in Christ. This means that all things fit together, are joined together, and exist in Christ. The tenth point is that Christ is the Head of the Body, which is the church. The eleventh point is that Christ is the beginning, the start; the twelfth point is that He is the Firstborn from the dead; the thirteenth point is that He has the preeminence or first place in all things; and the fourteenth point is that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him.</p>
<p>If we spend some time to read Colossians 1:13-19 and to meditate over these fourteen items, we will see what a Christ we have. God&rsquo;s kingdom has been committed to Him, He is the Son of God&rsquo;s love, and He is the image of the invisible God. With regard to creation, He is the Firstborn of all creation and all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him. He is also before all things and everything that has been created subsists in Him&mdash;He is the center and sphere within which all things are joined together to exist. With regard to the new creation, He is the Head of the Body, the beginning, and the Firstborn from the dead, that is, the Firstborn of resurrection. He is also the One who has the first place in all things and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells. By meditating on these fourteen items revealed in Colossians 1:13-19, we will have a deeper realization concerning who Christ is.</p>
 <p>Colossians 2:2-3 says, &ldquo;That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; These two verses contain three important points. The first is the mystery of God, the second is that the mystery of God is Christ, and the third is that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in the mystery of God, which is Christ. Not merely do all wisdom and knowledge dwell in Christ, but even more, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge dwell in Him.</p>
<p>Verses 6 through 9 continue, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; These verses contain six crucial phrases. The first is <em>you have received the Christ.</em> This is the only place in the entire Scriptures that says so directly that we have received Christ. The second expression is <em>walk in Him.</em> Having received the Christ, we must walk in Him. This means that our whole daily living must be in Christ. The third important phrase in these verses is <em>having been rooted,</em> and the fourth is<em> being built up.</em> Our being rooted in Christ has already been accomplished, but our being built up is presently taking place. We need to pay careful attention to these four expressions: <em>received, walk in, having been rooted,</em> and <em>being built up.</em></p>
<p>The fifth expression that we should take note of is <em>beware that no one carries you off as spoil.</em> In the original Greek this expression&mdash;<em>carries you off as spoil</em>&mdash;conveys the thought of being captured away and made prey of. In this verse Paul warned the believers in Colossae that they were in danger of being captured and carried away. What did he fear they would be carried away from? He feared that they would be carried away from Christ. Thus, he charged them to beware of being carried off as spoil through philosophy and empty deceit, &ldquo;according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sixth important expression in these verses is <em>for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</em>This is the reason that we must take heed not to be captured away by men or anything else. There are so many things in this world that are trying their best to make us a prey and take us away from Christ. We have to beware to prevent this from happening, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ. We need to seek Christ and hold to Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 16 and 17 say, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; In these two verses we see that food, drink, feast days, a new moon, and the Sabbath are all shadows and figures; the reality is Christ Himself. The real food and the real drink are Christ Himself. Moreover, the real feast day, which is a time of happiness, the real new moon, which is a new beginning, and the real Sabbath, which is a day of rest, are all Christ. Christ is our time of happiness, Christ is our new beginning, and Christ is our rest. Christ is the body of all these things.</p>
<p>Verse 19 goes on to say, &ldquo;And not holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; This verse reveals that in the Body there are joints and sinews. The joints supply, and the sinews knit together. This verse also unveils that when we hold the Head, the result is the increase, growth, of God. The One whom we hold is Christ, and the One who increases is God. While we are holding fast to Christ, the joints supply, the sinews knit together, and the result is that the element and fullness of God grow and increase in us.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:3-4 says, &ldquo;For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.&rdquo; These verses are very mysterious. Verse 3 tells us that we have died, but then immediately says that we have life. On the one hand, we are dead and have been finished, but on the other hand, we still have life. The life that we now have is a new life, a life that is &ldquo;hidden with Christ in God.&rdquo; Moreover, this life, which is hidden with Christ in God, is Christ, and this Christ, with whom our life is hidden in God, is our life. In addition, this Christ who is our life will be manifested in glory, and when this happens, we will be manifested with Him. Who can apprehend such words? Surely they are too mysterious.</p>
<p>Verses 9 through 11 go on to say, &ldquo;Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; On the one hand, we have put off the old man, and on the other hand, we have put on the new man. In this new man there are no Jews, Greeks, Chinese, or Americans, but Christ is all and in all. In the new man there is nothing but Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 15 through 17 say, &ldquo;And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&rdquo; These verses speak of two matters&mdash;the peace of Christ and the word of Christ. Our heart should be ruled by the peace of Christ, and our mouth should be filled with the word of Christ. When this is so, we will express Christ. Within, the peace of Christ will arbitrate, and without, what we express with our mouth will be the word of Christ. We need to be filled with the word of Christ to the extent that we express Christ with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Not only should we express Christ in common words and ordinary speech, but we should have psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs that are full of the expression of Christ, full of the language of Christ and the word of Christ.</p>
<p>After telling us to have our heart ruled by the peace of Christ and our mouth filled with the word of Christ, these verses tell us that we should do all things &ldquo;in the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; What does it mean to do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus? This means that whatever we do, we do it as a representative of Christ. In the name of Christ means representing Christ. When I go to visit someone in the name of Mr. Jones, it means that I go as a representative of Mr. Jones. Whatever we do, we should do it as a Christ-man, a Christian, a man representing Christ.</p>
<p>Let us now consider one verse from chapter four. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.&rdquo; The word <em>speech</em> in this verse comes from the Greek word <em>logos,</em> which means &ldquo;word.&rdquo; Thus, we can also translate this verse as, &ldquo;Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt.&rdquo; What does the expression <em>with grace, seasoned with salt</em> mean? What is grace? The Scriptures reveal that grace is Christ (Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 15:10). And what is salt? Unlike honey or sugar, salt can be used to kill germs. The spiritual meaning of salt is the working of the cross to kill all the germs. Thus, for our word to be always with grace, seasoned with salt means that our word should always be filled with Christ and should always pass through the killing of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF THOUGHT IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>If we consider all these passages from the book of Colossians we can see that there is a sequence and a particular line of thought throughout the book from chapter one to chapter four. As the apostle Paul wrote this book, he surely had a line of thought in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being a Mystery</h2>
<p>The line of thought in the book of Colossians begins with God, who is a mystery. All that God is and all that God has are a mystery. Paul begins his Epistle from this point.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>Paul continues his line of thought by revealing that the mystery of God is Christ Himself. What is unable to be understood in God, can be understood in Christ; what cannot be seen in God, can be seen in Christ; and what cannot be apprehended and realized in God, can be apprehended and realized in Christ. Paul&rsquo;s first point is that God is a mystery, and his second point is that this mystery is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Everything</h2>
<p>Then the third point in the line of thought in Colossians is that since Christ is the mystery of God, God has made Him to be everything. The fact that God has made Christ everything is clearly revealed in the first two chapters of this book. Paul unveils Christ in three aspects: what He is to God, what He is to creation, and what He is to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">What Christ Is to God</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Son of God&rsquo;s Love</h2>
<p>The first aspect of who Christ is to God that is revealed in Colossians is the Son of God&rsquo;s love. What is a son? A son is the manifestation of the father. When we see a son, we know that there is a father somewhere. We do not need to ask this son whether or not he has a father. As long as there is a son, there must be a father. In addition, by observing the son, we can see what the father is like. In the same way, as the Son of God Christ manifests His Father. Christ is not only called the Son of God but &ldquo;the Son of His love.&rdquo; This indicates how pleased God is with Christ as His Son.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Image of the Invisible God</h2>
<p>The second aspect of who Christ is to God as revealed in Colossians is God&rsquo;s image. God is invisible, but He has an image that is visible. This is Christ. Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. We cannot see God, but we can see Christ. We cannot touch God, but the apostles said that they not only saw Christ but even touched Him (1 John 1:1).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The One in Whom God&rsquo;s Fullness Dwells</h2>
<p>Christ is also the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells. Thus, Paul reveals three aspects of who Christ is to God. He is the Son of God&rsquo;s love, the image of the invisible God, and the One within whom all the fullness of God dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head3">What Christ Is to Creation</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Firstborn of Creation</h2>
<p>In the first chapter of Colossians, Paul also unveils several items of what Christ is with regard to creation. The first item is that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. This is a mystery. Christ is not only the Creator, He the Firstborn of creation. Creation is an action, and Christ is the Firstborn of this action. Christ is also the first item of this creation. This makes Christ not only God the Creator but also the first action of creation and the first creature of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The One in Whom, through Whom,<br />
and unto Whom All Things Were Created</h2>
<p>In addition to being the Firstborn of all creation, Christ is the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created. <em>In Him</em> means in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. <em>Through Him</em> indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished. <em>Unto Him,</em> or <em>for Him,</em> indicates that Christ is the end of all creation. All things were created unto Him for His possession. <em>In, through,</em> and <em>unto</em> indicate that creation is subjectively related to Christ. Christ is the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The One in Whom All Things Cohere</h2>
<p>Christ is also the One in whom all things subsist. All things subsist and are joined together in Christ. Christ is like the hub of a wheel. All the spokes of the wheel are joined together in the hub. If you take away the hub, all the spokes will be disconnected, and the wheel will cease to exist. All the items in the entire universe are joined together and have their existence in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">What Christ Is to the New Creation, the Church</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Firstborn of Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ is so much to the old creation, and He is also so much to the new creation, the church. The first item of who He is to the new creation is the Firstborn of the dead, the Firstborn of resurrection. Again we see that Christ is the Firstborn. Christ died and then was resurrected from the dead. He is the Firstborn of the dead, the Firstborn of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Head of the Body</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Head of the Body, the church. Thus, to the church Christ is both the Firstborn of resurrection and the Head of the Body.</p>
<p>The whole universe is composed of three big items&mdash;God, the old creation, and the new creation. Besides these three items, there is nothing else. To God, Christ is the Son of God&rsquo;s love, the image of the invisible God, and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells. Besides Christ and outside of Christ, there is no God. Within Christ is God, the essence of God, and the reality of God. Everything of God, all of God&rsquo;s fullness, dwells in Him. With regard to the old creation, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created, and the One in whom all things cohere. To the new creation, Christ is the Firstborn of resurrection and the Head of the Body, the church. This is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him. Generally those who receive Christ consider that He is the One who was crucified on the cross, bore our sins, shed His blood, and was buried and resurrected. This is what they believe and confess. In this portion of the Word, however, Paul depicts a Christ who is much more than this. The Christ who is the mystery of God is so much to God, to the old creation, and to the new creation. This is the third point in the apostle&rsquo;s line of thought in the book of Colossians. Paul&rsquo;s desire was to unveil such a Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Life</h2>
<p>The fourth point in the apostle Paul&rsquo;s line of thought is that Christ is our life. In the past we may have realized that Christ is our life, but did we realize that the Christ who is our life is such a Christ? This Christ, who is so much to God, to the old creation, and to the new creation, is our life. This is why we must walk in Him, live in Him, take hold of Him, and beware of being captured away from Christ by anything else. This world is full of thieves, robbers, and enemies, all trying their best to make us a prey and to capture us away from Christ. In this book these things do not refer to bad things but to many good things, such as philosophy, human knowledge, and human wisdom. History tells us of one group of people who put a very high value on philosophy. These people are known as the Gnostics. They appreciated Greek literature, Greek philosophy, and Persian thought very much. These items may seem to be very good from the perspective of human ethics, but they are enemies of Christ. All these things will make us prey, capture us, and carry us away from Christ. This is why we must hold fast to Christ as our life.</p>
<p>When I was very young, around eleven or twelve years of age, I studied at an elementary school established by the Baptist mission. Then I went to a college that had been started by the American Presbyterian mission. As a result of attending these two schools, I met many missionaries. My impression of them was that nearly all of them appreciated the teachings of Confucius very much. Once I heard one of them say, &ldquo;The teachings of Confucius correspond with the teachings of the New Testament.&rdquo; The teachings of Confucius may appear to be good, but actually they are enemies of Christ, capturing people and carrying them away from Christ.</p>
<p>During the time that I attended the Presbyterian college, every weekday from eleven thirty to twelve noon we had what was referred to as &ldquo;chapel time.&rdquo; During this time someone would give a sermon, and we would listen. Of all the sermons that I heard, I never heard a single one that told us how to practice taking Christ as our life or how to experience Christ as our life. Instead, we heard only teachings. These teachings were substitutes for Christ and enemies of Christ. All of the teachings were good, fundamental, and scriptural, but they were enemies of Christ because they kept those who heard them away from Christ.</p>
<p>We all must realize that Christ is a living person. He is the image of the invisible God, the center of the whole universe, the Head over all things, and a real person to be our life. Our concern should not be with doctrines or teachings but with this living person. We must deal with, contact, and fellowship with this living Christ moment by moment. We are not here just to learn His teachings; we are here to learn how to live in Him, with Him, by Him, and through Him. Christ is a living person to be our very life. We are here to learn how to take Him as our daily life. This is the apostle&rsquo;s thought in telling us that Christ is our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Reality</h2>
<p>After revealing that Christ is our life, the apostle makes this very practical. He writes, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath&rdquo; (Col. 2:16). All these items&mdash;eating, drinking, feasts, a new moon, and the Sabbath&mdash;are all good things. No one can live without eating and drinking; everyone likes to enjoy a happy day of feasting; everyone likes a new moon, which represents a new beginning with new hope; and everyone likes to have rest, which is typified by the Sabbath. After listing all these positive items, the apostle goes on to say, &ldquo;Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ&rdquo; (v. 17). Paul&rsquo;s thought here is that all these things are just a shadow, the reality of which is Christ Himself. Christ is our real food, our real drink, our real time of feasting, our real new beginning, and our real rest. Thus, the way to experience Christ as our life in our daily life is to take Him as all these items.</p>
<p>To illustrate how we can take Christ as so many things in a practical way, I would like to share with you the following testimony. I believed in the Lord over forty years ago. At that time the Chinese New Year was very important to the Chinese people. The custom was that everyone would rise up early in the morning (some even did not sleep the night before), put on new clothing, and begin to do many things to celebrate the New Year. I also participated in many of these things until around two years after I had been saved. After I had been saved for around two years, when the New Year arrived, I no longer had the heart to enjoy all those things. My heart was wholly on the Lord.</p>
<p>Before I went to bed the night before the first day of the New Year, I spent much time studying the Scriptures. When I went to sleep that night, I was so happy and full of joy, and the next morning when I rose up, right away I knelt down to pray. The moment I knelt down, I was full of the feeling that the Lord was with me. The Lord&rsquo;s presence was so near to me, and the Lord seemed so sweet to my heart. While I continued kneeling in prayer, my mother came to my room and said to me, &ldquo;Come and put on your new clothes.&rdquo; At that time I was still under my mother&rsquo;s hand, so I went to my mother&rsquo;s room where she had laid out a complete set of new clothes for me. After putting on all the new clothes, I went back to my room and knelt down to pray again. This time, however, the Lord was gone. According to my feeling, the Lord was far away from me. I simply could not pray, and I knew that something was wrong with my new clothes.</p>
<p>After some time I got back up and returned to my mother&rsquo;s room. I said to her, &ldquo;Mother, I am sorry, but I have to take off these new clothes.&rdquo; When my mother heard this, she looked at me and asked, &ldquo;Are you mad? What are you saying?&rdquo; I answered her, &ldquo;Please forgive me, but I simply cannot wear these new clothes.&rdquo; Then I went and took off all the new clothes, put my old clothes back on, and returned to my room to pray once more. When I knelt to pray, my eyes were filled with tears, and once again I sensed the full presence of the Lord. Through this experience, I learned that from that day on I should no longer celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>After I stopped celebrating New Year&rsquo;s Day, several times my friends came to me and said, &ldquo;We feel so sorry for you. You never celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Day, and you never go to the movies.&rdquo; When they said things like this to me, I would answer them, &ldquo;I feel even more sorrowful for you. There is no need for you to be sorry for me. Every day is a New Year&rsquo;s Day to me, because I have Christ. I do not need a feast day, because every day is a feast to me, and every day is a good time to me. I also do not need to go to movies, because Christ is my pleasure. Do not be sorrowful for me; just be sorrowful for yourself. I have Christ, and He is everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By telling us that Christ can be all these things to us, the apostle Paul gave us a practical way to experience Christ as our life. Christ is the real food, the real drink, the real feast, the real new moon, and the real Sabbath. Christ is also the real light. If we do not have Christ as our light, then we are in darkness. We should tell people, &ldquo;If you do not have Christ as your clothing, then you are naked. Your clothing is merely a shadow. Christ is our real covering.&rdquo; This should not be merely a doctrine to us. This must be our actual experience. All positive things are but a shadow. Christ is the reality, and by taking Him as the reality of all these things, we can have the practical experience of Christ as our life.</p>
<p>The book of Colossians reveals that as the mystery of God, Christ is everything. As the Son of God&rsquo;s love, the image of the invisible God, and the One in whom God&rsquo;s fullness dwells, Christ is everything to God. As the Firstborn of creation, the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created, and the One in whom all things cohere, Christ is everything to creation. Finally, as the Firstborn of resurrection and the Head of the Body, Christ is everything to the new creation, the church. Colossians also unveils that Christ is our life and the reality of every positive thing in the universe. Since Christ is so rich and all-inclusive, we need to experience and enjoy Him every day.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD IN COLOSSIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:9-13; 2:6-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;FILLED WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WILL IN ALL SPIRITUAL WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In this message we will base our fellowship on Colossians 1:9-13. These verses say, &ldquo;Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, to walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God, being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light; who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses speak of being filled with &ldquo;the full knowledge of His will.&rdquo; To be filled with the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s will simply means to have the revelation of God&rsquo;s plan, so that through this revelation we know what God plans to do in this universe. As believers we have to know God&rsquo;s universal plan. What did God plan in eternity past to do in time throughout all the generations? We need such a revelation so that we can have the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>The revelation of God&rsquo;s plan opens the way for us to have more experience of Christ. We all need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;How much do I know concerning God&rsquo;s plan? How much do I know concerning Christ in the plan of God?&rdquo; The more we know concerning this, the better. Thus, we need to spend more time to learn about Christ in the plan of God. This is one of the most important reasons why we have to read the Scriptures. We read the Scriptures not to receive doctrine or teachings but to receive the revelation of Christ and the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>What is the difference between the doctrine of Christ and the revelation of Christ? Strictly speaking, the Bible is not a book of doctrine or teaching. The Bible is a book of revelation. The Bible opens the universal curtain, the universal veil, to show us what is in the mind of God and what it is that God plans to do in this universe. This plan is to make His Son everything. God&rsquo;s desire, plan, and mind is to make Christ everything. This is the content of the entire Scriptures. Thus, we need to spend more time to read the Scriptures with such a view and expectation&mdash;not expecting to learn more doctrines and teachings but expecting to know Christ more and to receive more of the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>As we receive more spiritual understanding, we should also pray that the Lord would give us the spiritual language, the spiritual utterance. We need to have the <em>logos</em>&mdash;the word, the language, the utterance&mdash;within us. Not only do we need to have spiritual understanding in our mind and wisdom in our heart and spirit, but we also need to have the spiritual language and utterance in our mouth. Then we will be those who know the plan of God and are also able to explain it to others. We will not only love the things of God but will be able also to utter them and even give a message concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;TO WALK WORTHILY OF THE LORD&rdquo;</h2>
<p>According to Colossians 1:9-13, first we receive the knowledge of God&rsquo;s plan and then, based on that knowledge, we &ldquo;walk worthily of the Lord.&rdquo; To know is first; to walk is second. Knowing the will of God and the eternal plan of God enable us to walk worthily of the Lord. Our revelation directs our walking. Our walk is under the control of the revelation that we have.</p>
<p>We all need to spend time to read the Scriptures, to meditate on the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and to pray concerning these matters until we are filled with the truth and with the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. When this happens, we will have wisdom in our spirit and heart and spiritual understanding in our spiritually enlightened and renewed mind. We will have knowledge, not in our natural mind with its natural concepts but in our renewed mind that has been given understanding by the Holy Spirit through our spirit. Then this knowledge, this revelation, will direct and control our daily walk. Thus, first we need to know the will of God&mdash;to know that Christ is everything. Then we will walk according to what we know. This walk will be worthy of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;BEING STRENGTHENED WITH ALL POWER,<br />
ACCORDING TO THE MIGHT OF HIS GLORY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First we know and then we walk, but in order to walk we also need to be strengthened. Without the strength, we cannot walk. Colossians 1:11a says, &ldquo;Strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory&rdquo; (ASV). Notice the three words used in this verse: <em>strengthened, power,</em> and <em>might.</em> This is significant. In writing the Holy Scriptures, the Holy Spirit was not loose. He chose every word. The three words in this verse point to three stages. <em>Strength</em> is the first stage, <em>power</em> is the second stage, and <em>might</em> is the third stage. <em>Strength</em> refers to an inner energy or a life power. There is a life within us that is a power to us. This life is Christ Himself. This can be likened to the gasoline in a car. The gasoline provides the power within a car. As our life Christ is the life power within us, energizing us continually. This energizing is an inner strength that strengthens us all day long.</p>
<p>This inner strengthening brings us to the second stage&mdash; power. When we are strengthened by the life of Christ from within, we have the power. We have the power to love others, the power to be patient, and the power to do the Lord&rsquo;s work. The strength becomes a power. The strength is the initiative, and the power is the strength in action.</p>
<p>This strength in action, this power, then produces a condition in which we shine out the glory of God. This is the third stage&mdash;the might of His glory. The strength is something that operates within our spirit and heart, the power is the strength in action, and the might is something that is manifested in the action that we are taking. When we contact the Lord Himself, we are strengthened by Him from within. By being strengthened, we receive power, and this power enables us to walk. The result of this is the might of glory.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by a light bulb. When a light bulb is connected to an electrical outlet, it is &ldquo;strengthened&rdquo; by electricity. As a result, it has the power to shine out light. This can be considered the light of glory. In the same way, when we contact the Lord in prayer, meditation, reading the Scriptures, and fellowship with Him, we are strengthened in our spirit and heart. This gives us the power to live our daily life. As a result, people will see the glory of God in us. The glory of God is able to shine through us because we have the might, we are able to realize the might because we have the power, and we have the power because we have been strengthened by the Lord through our contact with Him.</p>
<p>I once knew a brother who exemplified this experience. This brother was very beloved, and he was truly spiritual in his condition before the Lord. Before he was saved, he worked for the customs office in China. At that time, everyone who worked for the customs office received a very good salary. As a consequence, they all lived very wealthy and worldly lives. Day by day they went to parties, dances, and movies, and participated in all sorts of entertainment. When this brother received the Lord, he gave up all these worldly things. When his wife saw this, however, she was not happy, and she did not agree. It is often the case that the wives have problems with the world. Their love for the world is often a problem for their husbands and their families. Women often love the world more than men.</p>
<p>After this brother got saved, his wife&rsquo;s attitude toward him changed. One day when this brother came home from work, as soon as he walked in the door the wife started taking pictures off the wall and throwing them at him. What did this brother do in this situation? He did not speak loudly but gently. He simply said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord. Thank Jesus.&rdquo; Then the wife began to pick up other things to throw at him. When the wife did this, the brother went into his room, knelt down, and began to pray. The wife began to shout at him, but the brother just knelt down and prayed and prayed. Eventually, the wife could not do anything further.</p>
<p>Whenever you saw this brother, you could realize that there was glory with him. The glory of God was upon this brother. You also realized that this brother was not weak. He was a man of might. He was able to endure with joy. He could suffer all these hardships with joy.</p>
<p>One day this brother invited some brothers to his home for a love feast and some fellowship. You can never imagine what his wife did. She did not cook anything new; instead, she brought out all the leftovers from the previous day. When we brothers sat down to eat, everyone saw that the wife had not cooked anything new but had put out leftovers from the day before. Brothers, do you think that you could bear this? What do you think that this brother did? With tears in his eyes, he said to the brothers, &ldquo;Let us praise the Lord for the leftovers. I do believe that this is the best love feast.&rdquo; All the brothers then said, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah! This truly is the best feast.&rdquo; This brother experienced Christ in the midst of his difficult situation.</p>
<p>What then was the outcome of this situation? The outcome was that one day the wife was brought to the Lord. She was convinced by her husband&rsquo;s condition&mdash;by the might of glory that she saw in him.</p>
<p>Before the wife was saved, the news of this situation came to me. I heard about all these things that were happening. Then one day I went to the town where this husband and wife lived. The church there was having a series of gospel meetings, but the wife refused to come to any of the meetings. At that time nearly all the other wives of the men who worked in the Chinese customs were saved. They all lived together in dormitories for customs employees. Since all of these other ladies were saved, I had some fellowship with them. I asked those sisters to try their best to bring the wife to the gospel meetings. Eventually they did bring her, and after the message on the third day, I noticed a change in her face. When I saw her, my spirit realized that the Lord had done something within her. At the end of the meeting, a call was made for those in the congregation to make a decision. During this call for decision we sang a hymn. While we were singing, I realized that she was the only one that the Lord was calling at that time, so we sang the hymn once, then twice, then three times. As I observed her, I noticed that she had brought her young daughter with her to the meeting. I noticed also that the little girl was speaking to her mother. The little girl spoke to her for some time, and then suddenly the young daughter stood up onto the bench upon which they had been sitting. She stood up and said, &ldquo;Mother, I stand for you.&rdquo; Then with tears the mother followed. As soon as she stood up, the whole meeting just burst; the whole meeting was immediately filled with praises and hallelujahs. The wife had been brought to the Lord! The very next day after her salvation, the wife asked the brothers who had been to her home when she had served leftovers to come to their home again; this time to have a real love feast and time of fellowship. This story is a good example of what can happen when we are strengthened by the Lord with all power according to the might of His strength.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;GIVING THANKS TO THE FATHER,<br />
WHO HAS QUALIFIED [US] FOR A SHARE<br />
OF THE ALLOTED PORTION OF THE SAINTS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First we need to know the will of God, the mystery of God, which is Christ Himself. Then we need to walk according to what we know, to walk under the control of the revelation that we have seen. To do this, we must be strengthened so that we will obtain the power and have the might. After these three experiences&mdash;knowing, walking, and being strengthened&mdash;we should add a fourth&mdash;giving thanks to the Father (v. 12a). We should sing hymns, offer praise, and give thanks to the Father for qualifying us for a share of the portion of the saints. These are the four steps of our experience&mdash;to know, to walk, to be strengthened, and to thank. I believe that this is what the apostle Paul meant when he prayed for the saints. He prayed that the saints would be filled with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan, that is, that they would have the revelation of the mystery of God, which is Christ Himself, so that they would walk according to this revelation by being strengthened. Those who are brought into this experience will thank God for His mercy and grace that qualified them for a share of the portion of the saints, which is the all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;IN THE LIGHT&rdquo;</h2>
<p>We also must realize that all these four steps are &ldquo;in the light&rdquo; (v. 12b). Light is a sphere, a realm. There is a realm and sphere of light and a realm and sphere of darkness. These two realms are two kingdoms&mdash;a kingdom of darkness and a kingdom of light. Consider all the people of the world today. They are walking in a sphere and a realm that is actually the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of Satan. Those who know God&rsquo;s plan, who walk according to that plan, and who are strengthened with the power of Christ to share the portion of the saints, however, are walking in another realm. What realm is this? This is the realm of light, which is the kingdom of light, the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The more we have the revelation of God&rsquo;s plan and the more we experience Christ, the more we will feel that we are in the light. Our whole daily life and walk will be in the light. This realm of light is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. As you have more revelation of the mystery of God and have more experience of Christ in a practical way, your daily life and your whole being will be brought into a realm of light. This will cause you to be controlled and directed by the divine light.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be controlled, directed, and ruled by light? Let us consider the opposite of this. Suppose we were in a room where there was absolute darkness. The result would be total confusion. When the sun is shining and the lights in the room are turned on, however, we are all kept in a state of order. The light keeps us in order, and thus, the light controls, directs, and rules us. We eat in the light, speak in the light, and listen to messages in the light. This is what it means to have a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light. <em>In the light</em> means under the control, direction, and rule of light.</p>
<p>What then is the light that controls us? The answer is in John 1:4. This verse says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; When we experience Christ as our life, that very life at that very moment becomes our light. In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; This is true in our experience. The more we experience Christ, the more we have light, because light is nothing other than the life of Christ that we experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;DELIVERED...OUT OF THE AUTHORITY OF DARKNESS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Immediately after Colossians 1:12 says that we are in the light, verse 13 tells us that we have been delivered out of the authority of darkness. The authority of darkness is the realm of darkness, the kingdom of darkness. This verse also tells us that we have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love. We have been translated, transferred, from one realm into another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;TRANSFERRED...INTO THE KINGDOM<br />
OF THE SON OF HIS LOVE&rdquo;</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Love, Light, and Life</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:12 speaks of light; Colossians 1:13 speaks of love: &ldquo;the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo; What is love? You may say that God is love. This is correct (1 John 4:8, 16). Love is God&rsquo;s essence, element, and substance. The Scriptures also reveal that God is light (1:5). The two, love and light, are a pair. Love and light are also related to life, for God is life (cf. John 14:6). What then is the relationship between love, light, and life, and what is the difference between these three? Love is the substance, essence, and element of life; life is the energy and strength of love; and light is the shining forth of love. Love, life, and light are triune.</p>
<p>This matches our experience. The more we realize Christ as life, the more we are in the light and the more we have love. We are simply filled with love, and we love everyone and everything. As a result, people see that we are people who are full of love and full of light. When the life within us is lived out of us, it is lived out of us as love, and when this life is lived out of us as love, it shines. This shining is light.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:13 tells us that we have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. God has delivered us from darkness and translated us into the kingdom of love. The kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love means that God&rsquo;s kingdom is the kingdom of love. When we live in the light, we are in the kingdom of love. There is no hatred in light and no hatred in the life of Christ. There is also no jealousy or envy in the light or with the life of Christ. In the light and with the life of Christ, there is only love. How can we be humble? Only when we are filled with love. How can we endure? Only when we are filled with love. First Corinthians 13 reveals that love suffers long, love endures, and love is humble. We can express all the good things mentioned in this chapter because we are filled with love and are living in the kingdom of love. This kingdom of love is also the kingdom of light and of life. The kingdom of Christ is the kingdom of love, light, and life. God has delivered us from the kingdom of darkness, which is full of hatred, envy, jealousy, and pride. We have been delivered out of this kingdom and translated, transferred, into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. This kingdom is full of humility, long-suffering, endurance, sympathy, and compassion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Kingdom of Love<br />
Being the Kingdom of Christ</h2>
<p>This kingdom is called &ldquo;the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo; What does the expression <em>the Son of His love</em> mean? It means that Christ as the Son of God is the embodiment and expression of God&rsquo;s love. The word <em>Son</em> also conveys the thought of life. Thus, Christ is the embodiment, the expression, and the life of the love of God. In this kingdom of love, light, and life, Christ is the love, Christ is the light, and Christ is the life. Christ is also the kingdom&mdash;the sphere and realm. Christ is our love, our light, our life, and our kingdom. The kingdom of Christ is nothing other than Christ Himself as the love, light, and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in Christ as Our Kingdom</h2>
<p>Since Christ Himself is this kingdom, He is the sphere and realm in which we walk. Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; We have received Christ as our life, but we must realize that this life, Christ Himself, is a sphere, a kingdom, for us to walk in. We must &ldquo;walk in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suppose a friend of yours, whether a believer or an unbeliever, came to you and told you that we must live our lives endeavoring to do many good things. Would you listen to him? If not, what would you say to him? If I were in this situation, I would say to my friend, &ldquo;Friend, I am now in the kingdom of Christ. I only understand and take care of things related to the kingdom of Christ. I am not in the kingdom of goodness, and I am not in the kingdom of good works. I simply do not understand good things. Trying to do good is a foreign concept to me.&rdquo; The affairs of China are foreign to a person living in America. With regard to the affairs of China an American might say, &ldquo;I am an American. I do not understand the things of China. Regardless of whether they are good or bad, they are not my business because I am living in the kingdom of America.&rdquo; In the same way, everything related to good and evil are foreign to a man who is living in the kingdom of Christ. Good and evil do not belong to the kingdom of Christ. They belong to another kingdom&mdash;the kingdom of the knowledge of good and evil. Since we are living in the kingdom of the tree of life, which is Christ Himself (cf. John 15:1; 14:6), we do not understand the things that are outside of this domain. We are citizens of the kingdom of Christ, so we do not understand good or bad; we know only one thing&mdash;Christ as our life. Christ is our life, our love, our light, and our kingdom. Thus, we must walk in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Under the Rule of Love, Light, and Life</h2>
<p>As we walk in Christ as our love, light, and life, we will be under the rule of these very items. As elements of the kingdom of Christ, love, light, and life are ruling elements. Communist nations are ruled by communism. Thus, they are nations of communism. We, however, are ruled by love, light and life. Thus, our kingdom is a kingdom of love, light and life.</p>
<p>In the book of Colossians, Christ is our portion, our life, our love, our light, and our kingdom. Christ is everything to us. This is God&rsquo;s eternal plan&mdash;that we would experience Christ, who is the mystery of God, as our life and everything that we would be brought under the rule of the divine love and light to live in the kingdom of God, which is Christ Himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD IN COLOSSIANS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:6-12</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the experience of Christ as the mystery of God in Colossians 2:6-7: &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&rdquo; These two verses contain four very important expressions&mdash;<em>received the Christ, walk in Him, having been rooted,</em> and <em>being built up.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Even after having been saved for many years, I did not know the expression <em>receive Christ.</em> One day, however, I read a book written by Brother Watchman Nee which equated believing in Christ with receiving Christ (John 1:12). This was quite a new thought to me. From that time on, however, I realized that believing in Jesus is not simply to make a decision in one&rsquo;s mind to believe that there was once a person named Jesus Christ who died on the cross, bore the sins of the world, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to heaven. I saw that to believe in Christ is to receive Christ as the Spirit into our spirit. Today the Lord is in the Spirit and is even the Spirit Himself (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). Thus, when we believe in Him, we receive Him as the Spirit into our spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; cf. John 4:24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>After receiving Christ we must walk in Him. The word <em>walk</em> is very ordinary, but the phrase <em>walk in Him</em> is very peculiar. Could Confucius have told his disciples to walk in him? Can a professor tell his students to walk in him? No mere human being can tell others to walk in him. Only Christ can speak such words.</p>
<p>What then does this phrase mean? What does it mean to walk in Christ? Walking in Christ can be likened to living in a particular country. Just as I am living in America, according to the same principle, I am living in Christ. I am a citizen of the kingdom of Christ. Everything that is not Christ is simply foreign to me. I do not understand anything that is apart from Christ. Philosophy is foreign to me. Committing sins is foreign to me. Even doing good is something that I do not understand. I am not governed by trying to do good. All I understand is Christ. Christ is my kingdom. Christ is everything to me. This is what it means to walk in Christ, and this was the apostle&rsquo;s thought when he wrote this Epistle.</p>
<p>At the time that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians, the believers in Colossae were being distracted away from Christ by many good things. As a result, they were not walking in Christ&mdash;they were not &ldquo;living in their own country&rdquo; but had been brought into &ldquo;foreign kingdoms.&rdquo; Some of them had been brought into the kingdom of philosophy and were ruled by philosophy; others had been brought into the kingdom of worldly knowledge and were governed by that knowledge. In response to this situation the apostle seemed to tell them, &ldquo;You should not be carried away from Christ. Since you have received Christ as your life and kingdom, you have to live by Him and walk in Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I first came to this country, I heard people saying, &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; to each other. When I first heard this, I was surprised. However, now that I have been in America for some time, I am used to this expression, and I even use it. <em>Hi</em> is an American term. It is spoken with an American tone in an American atmosphere. This expression is suitable for America, but if you were to use it in Taiwan or Hong Kong, people would think that you were very strange. This expression is not appropriate for these places. Similarly, many times when we hear a message given by a preacher, we realize that certain words that he is using should not be used in preaching the gospel. Recently, while translating some hymns, I also had this feeling. In one particular hymn I noticed that the word <em>mansion</em> was used. This word is not suitable for the kingdom of God. We should rather use words such as <em>habitation, house, temple,</em> and <em>dwelling place.</em> Certain words are not the right words for the kingdom of God and of Christ.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was very aware of this principle. Approximately thirty years ago, I spent a long period of time with him. During that time I was with him nearly every day, and whenever we were together, we always had much fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s work, the Scriptures, and various spiritual matters. We also had a good amount of fellowship concerning what terms, utterances, words, or phrases we were going to use in the messages. In this fellowship Brother Nee would often say, &ldquo;Brother, that word is not the right word for the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Using words that are appropriate for the kingdom of God is just one small example of what it means to walk in Christ. As citizens of the kingdom of God, which kingdom is simply Christ Himself, we must live a life that is suitable to Christ. Christ is our life, and He is also our kingdom. Thus, we must learn to walk in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ROOTED IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6 tells us that we have received Christ and that we should walk in Him; verse 7 reveals that we also have been rooted in Him. The fact that we have been rooted in Christ reveals that we have a very particular kind of unity and identification with Him. We have been planted in Him in the way of life, and as such, we draw all our nourishment and supply from Him, just as a plant draws all its nourishment and supply from the soil. Do we realize that we have been rooted in Christ? Do we have the thought that Christ is our soil? We all need to see that we are like little plants that have been rooted in Christ so that by His nourishing and supplying we will grow up.</p>
<p>All these items mentioned in Colossians&mdash;receiving Christ, walking in Christ, and being rooted in Christ&mdash;reveal Christ to us. They are all aspects of the full knowledge of Christ. Thus, we must study and consider all these aspects as they relate to and unveil Christ. What does it mean that we have received Christ? How do we receive Him and where do we receive Him? Moreover, what does it mean to walk in Christ, and how is it that we have been rooted in Christ? What do these items tell us concerning Christ? The fact that we have received Christ reveals that Christ to us is our life; the fact that we must walk in Christ unveils that Christ is also our kingdom&mdash;He is the realm in which we live and walk; the fact that we have been rooted in Christ indicates that Christ is our soil&mdash;the source from which we draw all of our nourishment and supply. If Christ were not life, how could we receive Him? If Christ were not the kingdom, how could we walk in Him? And if Christ were not our soil, how could we be rooted in Him? If we would spend some time to consider these matters, the Spirit would grant us revelation. As a result, we would know Christ more and more and would have a fuller revelation of Christ. This will cause us to jump up and praise the Lord. Praise the Lord that He is so much to us!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT UP IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Building Depending upon Growth</h2>
<p>The progression of thought in Colossians 2:6-7 is very peculiar. After telling us that we have received Christ, we might expect that the following phrase would tell us to keep Him. Instead, this verse says that since we have received Christ, we should walk in Him. Having received Christ, we should walk in Christ. Then verse 7 tells us that having been rooted in Christ, we are being built up in Him. It would seem to make more sense to say that having been rooted in Christ, we are growing up in Him, but instead of saying <em>growing,</em> this verse says <em>being built up.</em> Having been rooted in Christ, we are being built up in Christ.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be built up in Christ? What is the relationship between being rooted in Christ and being built up? As a young believer, I did not understand the meaning of being built up. I knew how stones were used in the building of a house, but I wondered, &ldquo;How can I be built up?&rdquo; Eventually I realized that to understand such a portion of the Scriptures requires that one spend much time to seek the Lord&rsquo;s mind. It requires that one consider other verses in the Scriptures that speak of these matters.</p>
<p>One such verse is 1 Corinthians 3:9, which says, &ldquo;For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; This verse corresponds with Colossians 2:7&mdash;our being God&rsquo;s cultivated land relates to our being rooted in Christ, and our being God&rsquo;s building relates to our being built up. As God&rsquo;s cultivated land, we must be rooted in Christ as our soil in order to grow; as God&rsquo;s building, we must be built up. Both these verses reveal that we are God&rsquo;s plants and God&rsquo;s building. What then is the relationship between growth and building, and how can being rooted and being built up be merged into one? The answer to these questions can be found in two verses in 1 Peter 2. Verse 2 speaks of our growth when it says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo; Verse 5 then continues, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; This verse merges growth and building together. We are stones that are being built, but we are living stones&mdash;stones that grow. As living stones we grow, and as we grow we are built together. On one hand, we are growing; on the other hand, we are being built together. As those who have received Christ, we must walk in Him as our kingdom; and as those who have been rooted in Christ, we must grow in order to be built up. This is Paul&rsquo;s thought in Colossians 2:6-7.</p>
<p>From the verses we have just considered, we can see that growth is for building and that building is the result of growth. When we grow up in Christ, we are built up with others. Without growth, there is no building. When we speak about the building of the church, we must remember that the real building of the church is the growth of all the brothers and sisters. We are built together by our growth. Thus, without our growth we can never be built together.</p>
<p>Recently in fellowshipping with some brothers, I became familiar with their understanding of building. According to their understanding, the believers, who are all materials for building, are built together when the Holy Spirit uses someone to gather them and &ldquo;pile&rdquo; them together. This is absolutely wrong. The building of the church is not the result of some kind of work; it is the result of the growth of the life of Christ in all of us. These passages in Colossians very much stress the life of Christ (cf. Col. 3:4). If there is no growth of the life of Christ among us, there is no possibility that the church will be built up among us.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Depending upon Transformation</h2>
<p>In our natural state we are not the material with which the church is built. In our natural state we are not stones, we are merely clay. We were made out of the dust of the earth, and thus we are merely clay in our natural state (Gen. 2:7; 2 Cor. 4:7). How then do we get from being clay to being stones that can be used for the building of the church? The way is to be transformed, to have our nature changed, by receiving another element into us. Often in chemistry when one element is added to another, it produces a change in nature in that element. We were all clay to begin with, but one day we received Christ. When Christ came into us, our nature began to change. We did not instantly change from clay to stone, but when we received Christ, this began a process of transformation by which we are progressively being changed in nature. The key to this process is to live Christ. The more we live Christ and experience Christ, the more Christ grows within us; and the more Christ grows within us, the more we are transformed from clay into stone. Only as stones can we be built together for the building of the church.</p>
<p>Many times it appears that certain brothers and sisters have been built together. After some time passes, however, it is manifested that they have not truly been built together, because they all are still primarily clay. If you take several pieces of clay, put some glue on them, and stick them together, you may think that you are doing the work of building, but eventually you will see that you are deceiving yourself. When a little water falls on the pieces of clay that you have glued together, the clay will dissolve, and your building work will be gone. If all the saints remain clay, even if they appear to be built together, once a little &ldquo;water&rdquo; falls on them, their so-called building will disappear.</p>
<p>Only those who have been transformed into living stones can be built together. Living stones are built together by growing together. This can be illustrated by the bones in the human body. If a person breaks one of his bones, as long as the two bones are held together, after a month or so they will grow back together. They will be built together by growing together. As those who have received Christ, we must learn to take Christ as our life and allow the life of Christ to increase within us day by day. If we know Christ as life&mdash;daily receiving all of our nourishment and life supply from Him&mdash;we will grow together and be transformed in Christ into living stones for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>A specific area of our being that must be transformed into stone in order for us to be built together is our soul, including our mind and emotion. Often when a brother comes to fellowship with me, after ten minutes I realize within myself that this brother&rsquo;s mind is just a piece of clay. His entire mentality and all that he thinks about are &ldquo;dusty,&rdquo; natural, and of Adam. His mind has not yet been transformed. Before such a brother can be built with others, he must grow up more in Christ; he must have his mind transformed into the image of Christ. It is also often the case with sisters that their emotion is like a piece of clay. Sometimes sisters come to fellowship with me and before they even say a word, they begin to cry. Their emotion is like a piece of clay that can be quickly dissolved. Once when a sister began to cry while speaking to me, I tried to give her the sympathy that she desired by speaking nice words to her and encouraging her. While I was speaking to her in this way, suddenly her emotion changed and she began to laugh. Within a period of only ten minutes, her emotion underwent such a big change. This is clay. Clay can be quickly changed and quickly dissolved. If our mind remains natural and our emotions are as free as those of the people in the world, we will never be able to be built up with others. We need our mind and emotion to be transformed from clay into stone.</p>
<p>The Scriptures provide several examples of people who were transformed in their soul. One such example is Aaron. When the two sons of Aaron died before the presence of the Lord, the Lord told Moses to tell Aaron not to weep. When Moses gave this word to Aaron, although Aaron&rsquo;s two sons had died, he accepted it and did not weep (Lev. 10:1-3, 6). This demonstrates that he was one who had strict control over his emotion. I believe that the apostle Paul was also such a person. Do you think that if Paul were to come to you while he was undergoing severe suffering that he would come to you with tears? I do not think that he would. If you were to contact him during such a time, I do not believe that you would even be able to tell that he was being deeply moved in his emotion. His emotion would be fully under his control. It would be solid, hard, and strong like a piece of diamond or precious stone. Even if he were to be delivered by the Lord in a miraculous way, I do not believe that he would laugh too much. Paul was a man whose emotion had been transformed from clay to stone.</p>
<p>Jacob was also one who was gained by God in his emotion. We can see this in the way that he reacted to the news that his son Joseph was still alive. For many years his dear son had been missing, and Jacob did not know if he was alive or dead. Then one day, his other sons returned from Egypt with proof that Joseph was alive and had become the highest ranking person in all of Egypt. If I were Jacob, upon hearing such news I would jump up and down and be mad with joy. I would be so happy that my son Joseph was still alive, and I would want to go visit him right away. But when we read the Scriptures, we realize that Jacob did not react in this way. When Jacob heard the news that Joseph was still alive, he was surely happy, but he was not overly excited. He was very calm in his reaction; in fact, he even seemed almost cold. In addition, soon after hearing this report he went to Beer-sheba to offer burnt offerings to the Lord and to seek the mind of the Lord as to whether or not he should go down to Egypt. Surely Jacob was happy, but he was not overly excited. His emotions were under control. This was not the emotion of Jacob, but the emotion of Israel&mdash;a transformed person.</p>
<p>In order for you to be built up with the other brothers and sisters, Christ must gain the ground in and occupy your emotion. If your emotion is so natural, so easy to be moved, and so easily hurt, it will be very difficult for you to be built up with the other brothers and sisters. One day you will be happy with them and the next day you will be unhappy with them. Thus, you must allow the Lord to grow in and transform your emotion so that your emotion will no longer be natural but spiritual.</p>
<p>The way to have this transformation is to love the Lord more and more. By loving the Lord, we will have wisdom and spiritual understanding, and our mind and emotion will be renewed and transformed from being natural to being spiritual. Loving the Lord causes us to know the Lord, and when we truly know the Lord, we will no longer be so easily moved or hurt in our emotions. It will not matter how the brothers and sisters treat us; regardless of how they treat us, we will remain the same. If they treat us well, we will be the same in our emotion. If they treat us in an evil way, we will be the same in our emotion. The Lord will have occupied our emotion and will have gained control of it. Our emotion will no longer be clay; it will be precious stone. As a result, we will be able to be built together with the other brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spiritual Growth Not Being an Individual Matter</h2>
<p>Since the church is built up by the growth of the believers, we must consider another matter related to our growth. As believers in Christ, we all need to grow. We must be clear, however, that spiritual growth can never be individual. The growth that builds the church can never be individualistic or independent of the other members. No single member can grow separately, independently, or individually. Genuine spiritual growth is always corporate. The members of the Body grow corporately, collectively, and jointly. Thus, if we desire to grow, we need to join ourselves with the other members of the Body, and the more we grow, the more our sense of this need to join ourselves to others will grow. This is the law of the Body and the principle of the Body. We can never be against this law, this principle. If you are against this law, then you will never grow. If you are independent and individual, then there will be no growth for you. Any member that is separated from the Body will die, and a dead member cannot grow. Thus, if we desire the genuine growth in life that builds up the Body of Christ, we must join ourselves to the other members and grow together with them in the Body.</p>
<p>Our experience of Christ, the growth of the life of Christ within us, and the mingling of Christ Himself with us cause us to become material that is suitable for God&rsquo;s building. Apart from these things we can never be used for God&rsquo;s building. Unless we have the element of Christ added to us, we will remain a piece of clay. We need Christ to increase and expand within us from one corner of our being to the other&mdash;from our heart to our mind and from our heart to our emotion. Thus, we must allow Christ to increase and expand in us all the time.</p>
<p>Many of the Christian books written today mention the building of the church. However, the books that I have read that speak of building do not have the proper understanding of this matter. Building is not the result of Christian work. The church is not built by some form of work that attempts to bring believers together. The church is built only by the growth in life. Only when all the believers experience Christ as life day by day and allow Him to increase and expand in them so that they will grow up in Him will the church be built. Any message, book, or literature that speaks of the building of the church must stress the experience of Christ as life. If it does not, it is talk that is vain and useless and teaching that can never be worked out. We must remember that the growth of the church depends upon the growth of the believers. Apart from this growth there is no building of the church.</p>
<p>Since we have received Christ as our life and all, we must walk in Him as our kingdom, our spiritual sphere, and since we have been rooted in Christ, we must grow up in Him in order to be built together with others to be the house of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">REALIZING THAT WE ARE NOTHING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS EVERYTHING<br />
BY BEING BROUGHT THROUGH SUFFERINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:11-12, 20; 3:1-5, 9-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN THAT CHRIST BE EVERYTHING TO US</h2>
<p>In eternity past God made a plan concerning what He would do in the times and generations of the ages. He planned to make Christ the center and Head of all creation. Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2). As such, He is the faithful image of the invisible God and the Firstborn of all creation (1:15), the Firstborn from the dead and the Head of the Body, which is the church (v. 18), the portion from God to us (v. 12), and even the kingdom (v. 13). We can share Christ, receive Christ, and walk in Christ. God also intends that Christ would be something to us that is more subjective than all of the above items. God intends that Christ would be our very life and element (3:4; cf. Eph. 2:5). God desires that Christ would come into our spirit as the Spirit to mingle together with us and to be our element (1 Cor. 6:17). In God&rsquo;s plan Christ is meant to be our life, our element, and everything to us.</p>
<p>Not only has God planned that Christ would be our life and everything, but He has also made Christ to be the reality of all positive things in the universe. All the physical things that we see are merely figures and shadows of the reality, which is Christ (Col. 2:17). All physical things are not real. Only Christ is real. The food we eat is not the real food; it is just a figure. Christ is our real food (John 6:35, 57). The house that we live in is not our real dwelling place. Our real dwelling place is Christ (cf. 15:4). The Lord is our dwelling place forever (Psa. 90:1). He is our eternal habitation, our eternal dwelling place (cf. Rev. 21:22). The physical life that we inherited from our parents is not the real life; it is merely a shadow, a figure. Christ is the real life (John 14:6). Thus, in the eyes of God if you do not have Christ, you do not have life. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Christ is also our real light and our real way (John 1:4; 1 John 1:5; John 14:6). All visible physical things are not real; they are simply figures and shadows of the reality, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>God intends that Christ would be everything to you. What do you desire? Do you desire the good land with its springs? Christ is the good land and its springs (cf. Deut. 8:7). Do you desire hope and peace? Christ is both hope and peace to us (Eph. 1:12; 2:14). Do you desire wealth? If so, Christ is our real wealth (cf. Eph. 3:8; Phil. 4:19) and our real treasure (2 Cor. 4:7). Do you need food to eat or a home in which to live? Christ is both of these things. Do you wish to receive a letter? Christ is even our letter (2 Cor. 3:3). Do you need clothing? Colossians 3:10-14 reveals that we can put on Christ as our real clothing. Do you need a head? Christ is our Head (Eph. 1:22). In fact, if you do not have Christ, you are a person without a head. Do you desire philosophy? Christ is much more than philosophy (Col. 2:3). We can never exhaust all the items of what Christ is to us. Christ is truly everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO APPLY CHRIST IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>Although Christ is everything, there is a problem. The problem is that although we have Christ within us, we do not apply Him in our daily life. We have Christ, but when we are thinking about something, we do not think by Christ. We have Christ, but when we are going to do something, we do not do it by Christ. We have Christ, but when we speak with people, we do not speak by Christ. This can be likened to owning a nice car but not knowing how to drive it. We have received Christ into us, but we do not apply Christ to our daily living.</p>
<p>Christians today often speak about doing what is right as Christians. Day by day they seek the Lord for His will so that they can know what they should or should not do. This kind of seeking, however, is short. Rather than seeking simply to know whether or not we should do a particular thing, we need to ask, &ldquo;If I do this particular thing, will I be doing it alone, or will Christ be doing it with me?&rdquo; This is what we must endeavor to know. When we are engaged in a particular activity, we must check to determine who it is that is acting. Are we acting alone, or is Christ acting in us and through us? In Galatians the apostle Paul testified, saying, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (2:20). We may often inquire, &ldquo;Lord, is this right for me to do?&rdquo; but we should also check to see whether we are acting by ourselves or whether it is Christ who is living in us.</p>
<p>One day a young brother asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, why do some say that Christians should not go to movies?&rdquo; In response to his question, I did not give him a long answer; I simply asked him, &ldquo;When you go to a movie, does Christ go with you?&rdquo; The young brother answered me, &ldquo;Of course, Christ does not go with me to the movie.&rdquo; Let alone going to movies, I would also ask, when we go to preach the gospel, who is the person who is going to preach? Do we go by ourselves to preach the gospel, or is Christ within us the One who is going to preach? When we visit another saint, do we visit that saint alone, or does Christ within us do it in us and with us? In other words, when we are doing all the things that we do in our daily life, do we truly apply Christ in what we are doing? If we have the revelation that Christ is everything to us, we will check. Day by day, moment by moment, and in whatever we are doing, we will check to see whether or not what we are doing is Christ living within us. We will check to see whether or not we are applying Christ in everything we do.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BROUGHT TO AN END IN ORDER<br />
TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>To apply Christ in everything we do and to experience Christ as everything to us we need not only the revelation of who Christ is, we also need to be brought to our end. In Paul&rsquo;s short Epistle to the Colossians, he refers to this numerous times. He says that we are dead (2:20; 3:3), that we have been buried (2:12), that we have to put off the old man (3:9), and that we have been circumcised (2:11). Why does Paul refer to all these experiences? He does so in order to make clear that God&rsquo;s intention is that we would be brought to our end and that, in fact, we have been brought to our end already. Why is this God&rsquo;s intention? God intends that we be brought to our end because He desires that Christ would be everything to us. We have to be &ldquo;out,&rdquo; so that Christ can come in; we have to be dethroned, so that Christ can be crowned; and we have to be brought to our end, so that Christ can be everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Emptied in Order to Be Filled</h2>
<p>This principle is clear when we consider that God created us as vessels to contain Christ. God created man according to His own image (Gen. 1:26) so that man would be a vessel to contain Christ (Rom. 9:21-23; 2 Cor. 4:7; 2 Tim. 2:20-21). However, before anything can be put into a vessel, the vessels must be empty. If there is something in the vessel, we must pour it out before we can fill it with anything else. Thus, as vessels made for the purpose of containing Christ, we must be emptied of everything that is not Christ before we can be filled with Christ. There is a major difference, however, between us and an ordinary vessel. If an ordinary vessel is filled with something, it is very easy to empty it out. But if we are filled with things other than Christ, it is not so easy to empty us of all these things. The reason is that we are living vessels&mdash;we have a mind, emotion, and will. Although the Lord desires to fill us with Himself, we may not always want to receive Him. It is very difficult to deal with living vessels. This is why we all must be brought to an end and finished. If we are no longer living, then it will be very easy for Christ to fill us with Himself and become everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Passing through Sufferings to Realize<br />
That We Are Nothing and Christ Is Everything</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is our life and everything. It also reveals that we have already been crucified and buried with Christ. The problem, however, is that although we are dead, we are still living. We have so much confidence in our self. We are so active, strong, and alive in our self, and it is very difficult for us to forget about our self. We may realize that God&rsquo;s intention is to make Christ everything to us and that we have been crucified with Christ, yet we must admit that we are still very living.</p>
<p>Faced with such a situation what must God do? What must God do to bring us to the point where we are able to be filled with Christ, to apply Christ in everything we do, and to take Christ as our life and everything? To bring us to this point, God must put us into circumstances in which we will experience suffering. There is no other way for God to bring us to an end but to allow us to pass through suffering. Through the pressure and burning of our environment our strong self will be put to death. Only real sufferings can bring us to an end, for the more we suffer, the more we will realize that we are nothing and Christ is everything. Everyone who desires to seek the Lord must pass through suffering. No one is an exception. This is the only way that God can bring us to the point where we are nothing and Christ is everything to us.</p>
<p>Recently a sister asked me a very good question. She said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, it seems that we have discovered a certain fact. Although it is very strange to us, it seems that often when there is a sister who loves the Lord and seeks after Him, her husband is against the Lord, and regardless of how much this sister prays for her husband, it seems that her prayers are not answered. Conversely, it seems that often when there is a brother who loves the Lord and seeks after Him, his wife is very much against Him. Why is this? Why is it so difficult to find a couple where both the husband and the wife love the Lord? In addition, why is it so often the case that parents who love the Lord have children who do not love the Lord, and children who are pursuing the Lord have parents who are against the Lord? Why is it so difficult to find an entire family who loves the Lord?&rdquo; The answer to this question is that God&rsquo;s intention is to put us into a situation of suffering, a situation that we have no way to run away from. It is true that some husbands are a great source of pressure to their wives, that some wives are a burning to their husbands, that some children are a great pressure to their parents, and that some parents are a burning to their children. This is all under the sovereign hand of God.</p>
<p>When trying to find someone to marry, all the young people try to find the best person. They consider at great length who would be the best one for them to marry. After many years of experience, however, I have no trust in this kind of consideration. There was once a young brother who was trying to find the right sister for him. He considered one sister after another but was not satisfied with any of them. Eventually, after much consideration he was satisfied with one. According to his feeling this one was the best sister for him. After this brother had been married for some time, however, one day he came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I repent.&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;What do you mean that you repent? What do you repent of?&rdquo; He then said, &ldquo;I repent of the choice that I have made regarding my marriage. I repent of choosing the sister whom I have chosen.&rdquo; When I heard this, I told him, &ldquo;Brother, you did your best to choose the best one, and eventually you got the best one. You must have the faith that this sister is the best one for you. No other sister could be better for you. You have chosen the one prepared by God for you. Your choice was under God&rsquo;s sovereignty. You and all your choices are under the hand of the Lord. You may be able to make a mistake, but God can never make a mistake. He is sovereign.&rdquo; According to our view, our spouse may be the worst, but according to God&rsquo;s view he or she is the best.</p>
<p>God is surely sovereign over whom we marry. He has chosen the best spouse for us. God is sovereign over all our circumstances and is arranging all our situations for one thing&mdash;to bring us through pressure and burning. We have so much confidence in our self, and it is so difficult for us to forget about our self. Thus, the only way for us to be saved is for God to put us into situations that will press us, burn us, and bring us to an end. We may need not only one wife but also several children to be the pressure and the burning power to bring us to an end. When we are brought to an end, we will be able to say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am finished.&rdquo; We will not say this based on our knowledge of this doctrine, but based on our experience we will say, &ldquo;Lord, I am finished.&rdquo; Then the Lord will answer us, &ldquo;It is very good that you are finished. Now I can be your life in a practical way. Now is the time for Me to be your all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more we have the revelation that Christ is all in all to us, the more we will have to be burned and pressed in order to actually experience Christ in this way. There are no exceptions to this principle. All seeking believers have to pass through certain pressures and suffer certain hardships. The more we see Christ and seek Christ, the more we will experience suffering. On the one hand, to experience Christ is to enjoy something, but on the other hand, to experience Christ is to suffer something. The reason that this is the case is that in order to experience Christ we have to be put to death. We are all too strong in our self. Thus, there is no other way for us to be brought to an end and for Christ to be everything to us but for us to be put to death by passing through suffering.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s hand is sovereign over us. The Lord knows exactly who we are and exactly what we need. If we long for a deeper experience of Christ, the Lord knows the way to grant us what we desire. The only way is to bring us through suffering. Only real suffering can bring us to an end, and only real suffering can put us to death. The more we suffer, the more we will realize that we are nothing, and the more we suffer, the more we will realize that Christ is everything.</p>
<p>In light of this we can see why Paul uses in Colossians 1:11 the expression <em>unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy.</em> Why would Paul mention endurance and long-suffering at the opening of this Epistle? He mentions these things because he knew from his experience that God must put us to death so that we might be able to experience Christ as everything to us. He knew that to pass through the experience of being put to death requires endurance and long-suffering.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a brother who is very active and clever and also very strong in his temper. Let us suppose that this brother also loves the Lord very much. He has seen something of Christ, and he longs to experience Christ in a practical way. For this brother to arrive at the point where he experiences Christ in this way is not so easy. It is rather hard for such a strong brother to stop himself and to experience Christ in whatever he is doing. He has the heart and the longing to experience Christ, but he is just not able to stop himself. As a result, he is unable to have much experience of Christ.</p>
<p>Before this brother can gain a deeper experience of Christ in which Christ becomes everything to him, this brother must first suffer many hardships. Thus, the Lord will exercise His sovereignty and will control everything relating to him and his environment. The Lord will bring him into a specific situation in which he will experience hardship after hardship. For three, five, or even ten years this brother will pass through suffering after suffering. After all these years of suffering, he will be brought to the point where it will be very easy for him to apply Christ to his daily living. Through the hardships in his environment, he will lose all confidence in himself and he will be brought to the point where he not only realizes that he is finished, but he also sees that he is nothing. When he reaches this point, it will be so easy and even automatic for him to apply Christ to his daily living. In whatever he does, he will automatically go to the Lord, trust the Lord, and fellowship with the Lord. It will also be easy for him to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The realization that he is nothing will make it very easy for him to experience Christ. In whatever he does, he will be one with the Lord. When this brother comes to read the Scriptures he will pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing. You are my all. You are everything to me. I am about to read the Scriptures, but I do not want to read them by myself. Lord, I would like to read with You. Lord, I am nothing. I would like for You to read the Scriptures with me.&rdquo; Eventually this brother will be able to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who read the Scriptures, but it is Christ. It is not I but Christ.&rdquo; When this brother comes before the Lord to pray, he will have the same feeling. He will tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing. You are everything to me. I do not want to pray by myself. Lord, I would love for You to pray with me.&rdquo; Through this kind of fellowship with the Lord, he will eventually be able to confess, &ldquo;It is no longer I who prays, but it is Christ who prays in me. I am nothing. Christ is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saints who meet a brother like this will immediately sense the presence of Christ. Whenever they contact him, they will sense that he is a man who is living Christ, walking with Christ, and lost in Christ. They will realize that he is a man who is filled with Christ and who has been blended and mingled with Christ. This is because by this point Christ is with him in whatever he does and in whatever he says. At this stage Christ has become life and everything to him in a practical way.</p>
<p>At this point in this brother&rsquo;s experience it will also be very easy for him to be builded together and joined with the other saints. The building will become very real to him and he will become a very useful brother. Because he realizes that he is nothing and Christ is everything, it will not be difficult for him to realize the genuine building of the church. He will also be a person who is very easy to deal with. At this time, this brother is both broken and mature.</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s plan&mdash;to bring us through sufferings so that we will realize that we are nothing and be able to experience Christ as our life and everything. For this, we all need to go to the Lord and pray. We all need to pray that the Lord would give us more revelation of His desire and direct our hearts into this way. I do believe that in these last days the Lord is going to recover His people back to the experience of Himself according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Christ is the mystery of God. As such, He can be experienced by us as our life and everything.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST PROGRESSIVELY, CONTACTING CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT,<br />
AND APPLYING CHRIST AS THE SENSE OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:17-19; 4:13; John 6:63; Rom. 8:2, 9-11; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; 1 Cor. 12:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Life and Everything</h2>
<p>As the mystery of God, Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Christ is God the Creator, the Firstborn of creation, the means of creation, and the center and Head of all that has been created. He is also the Firstborn from the dead, the Head of the church, and the One whom God intended would have the first place in all things. This is the Christ whom God intends would be our life and everything, and this is the Christ whom we have received. We now possess this very Christ in our spirit. We all should spend some time to pray and meditate before the Lord concerning all the items of whom Christ is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Reality</h2>
<p>As the mystery of God, Christ is not only our life and everything, He is also the reality of every positive thing in the universe. All the physical things that we see, taste, and touch are not real. They are merely figures and shadows, the reality of which is Christ Himself. The food that we eat every day is not real. If we do not have Christ, we are surely hungry and without food, because Christ is the real food for our whole being. Christ is the real food for our spirit, our soul, and our body. The Scriptures tell us that man shall not live on bread alone but by every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God and also that Christ Himself is the Word of God (Matt. 4:4; John 1:1). From this we can see that Christ is the real food. According to the same principle, we know that Christ is our real life. The physical life that we received from our parents is not the real life. If we do not have Christ, we do not have life; we are just dead people. This is clearly stated in 1 John 5:12, which says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; In His eternal plan, God has made Christ to be our real food, our real life, and the reality of all positive things in the universe.</p>
<p>This revelation needs to become clear to us to the point that we say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, if I do not have You, I have nothing, and I am nothing.&rdquo; We all need to see that even we ourselves are not real. I am not a real person, and you are not a real person. If we do not have Christ, we are nothing; we are through. Christ is the only real man. In fact, not only is Christ the only real man, but apart from Christ there is no real God. The real God is in Christ, and Christ is the reality of God. If there were no Christ, God would be merely a term or a name to us. We would have no way to realize Him. Christ is the real essence and element of the Godhead. Apart from Christ everything is but a name. Nothing is real, and everything is a failure without Christ. He is the real man, the real God, and the reality of every positive item in the universe.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is everything cannot simply be a doctrine to us; it must be realized in our experience. Do we have a mind? We do have a mind, but we need the realization that Christ is our real mind (1 Cor. 2:16). Do we have wisdom? We may think that we have wisdom, but we have to realize that our wisdom is nothing. Christ is the real wisdom (1:30). Do we have knowledge? We may have some knowledge, but Christ is the only real knowledge (Col. 2:3). Do we have love? We may have love, but we have to realize that Christ is the real love (Rom. 8:39; 2 Cor. 5:14; Eph. 3:19; 1 Tim. 1:14). Do we have patience? We may think that we have patience, but real patience is Christ Himself (cf. Gal. 5:22). We must realize that Christ is everything, and that Christ also fills everything&mdash;He is the &ldquo;the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:23). Is there a God? There is a God, but this God is in Christ. Is there man? There is man, but this man is in Christ (John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:47). Is there a Son? There is a Son, and this Son is Christ. Is there life? There is life, but only Christ is the real life (John 14:6). Is there light? There is light, and this light is Christ Himself (8:12). Every morning when we put on our clothes, do we have the sense that Christ is our real covering and our real clothing (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27)? When we are preparing to lie down on our bed, do we have the realization that Christ is our true rest, our real bed (Matt. 11:28)? When we are on our way home, do we have the feeling that the Lord is our home, our dwelling place (cf. Psa. 90:1; John 15:4)? When we are walking upstairs, do we realize that Christ is our real stairs and that apart from Him we can neither go up nor down (cf. John 1:51)? When we are going out of a door, do we tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You are my door, my entrance and my exit&rdquo; (John 10:9)? Do we experience Christ as the reality of all these items? Can we tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You are my sun, my moon, and my way&rdquo; (Mal. 4:2; Col. 2:16-17; John 14:6)? Our goal is not merely to understand the Bible according to the printed black and white letters. Rather, we are coming to the living Word of God to gain the deep sense that Christ is everything and to be brought into this experience. This is what God planned in eternity past, and this is what God is doing today. Although very few of the Lord&rsquo;s children realize this, God&rsquo;s intention is that Christ would be everything to us. Since this is God&rsquo;s intention, we must learn the practical way to experience, contact, and apply Christ. How do we do this? How do we experience Christ, how do we contact Christ, and how do we apply Christ? The answers to these questions are found throughout the Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST PROGRESSIVELY<br />
IN FIVE STAGES</h2>
<p>Our experience of Christ has five progressive stages. Galatians 1:16a says, &ldquo;To reveal His Son in me,&rdquo; and 2:20a states, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The first verse speaks of Christ being revealed in us, and the second verse speaks of Christ living in us. Chapter four, verse 19 says, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ can be formed in us. Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts: &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; Verse 19 goes on to say that we are &ldquo;filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; Finally, chapter four, verse 13 says that we will eventually arrive &ldquo;at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Together these verses reveal five stages of our progressive experience of Christ&mdash;Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, Christ is formed in us, Christ makes His home in us, and Christ&rsquo;s measure becomes our measure.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is that Christ would be revealed in us, live in us, and increase and expand within us to the extent that Christ would be formed within us. When God created man, He created us in His image (Gen. 1:26). Who is the image of God? Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; Since Christ is the image of the invisible God, and man was created according to the image of God, we can say that man was created according to Christ. A glove is created according to a hand. As such, it has four fingers and a thumb just like a hand. The reason that a glove is created according to a hand with four fingers and a thumb is so that a hand can fit into the glove. Why was man created according to Christ? Man was created according to Christ so that Christ would be able to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into man. Christ created man with a mind, an emotion, and a will. These parts of man are like the fingers of a glove, and Christ is like the hand that comes into the glove. Our mind, emotion, and will were all made for Christ. Today Christ may have already been revealed in us, but has Christ spread into our mind, emotion, and will? Has Christ been formed in us yet? Although we were created according to Christ, many of us may have a mind, emotion, and will that are absolutely without Christ. Christ as the hand has not filled any of the &ldquo;fingers.&rdquo; If there is no Christ in our mind, emotion, or will, then Christ has not yet been formed within us. Thus, we all need to allow Christ to fill our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>From time to time a husband may get angry with his wife. Those who are husbands among us may also have this experience, but when this happens, are they able to say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, right now I am angry with my wife, but even in my anger You are in me. You are in my anger.&rdquo; We should not think that this is impossible. When the Lord was on the earth, sometimes He became angry, and as those created according to Christ, anger is one of our emotions (cf. Eph. 4:26). Thus, the question is not whether we become angry, but whether Christ has filled our emotions. In like manner, we need to consider whether Christ has filled our mind and our will. If a glove has not been filled with a hand, then the glove has not yet been formed; likewise, if we have not been filled with Christ in our mind, emotion, and will, then Christ has not yet been formed within us.</p>
<p>Only when Christ is formed within us by expanding and increasing into every part of our being, can He make His home in our hearts; and only when Christ has made His home in our hearts, will we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. First Christ is revealed in us. Then He lives within us, is formed within us, and makes His home in our hearts. Finally the result of Christ being revealed in us, living in us, being formed in us, and making His home in our hearts is that we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is what God planned and intended in eternity past for a Christian to be&mdash;a person who is full of Christ. God desires that we would be filled with Christ not only in our spirit but also in our mind, emotion, will, and heart. At His coming, even our body will be full of Christ. At that time He will be glorified in us and through us, and we will be in His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While the five items that we have mentioned above reveal five stages of our experience of Christ, we also need to consider where Christ is today and how we can contact Him. For this, let us consider a second group of verses. John 6:63a says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life,&rdquo; and Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; These two verses reveal that the Spirit is the Spirit of life who gives life. Verses 9 through 11 continue, &ldquo;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the Spirit&mdash;who is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead&mdash;dwells within us. Second Corinthians 3:17-18 reads, &ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; These two verses contain three key phrases: <em>the Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord,</em> and <em>the Lord Spirit.</em> The final verse in this group of verses is 1 Corinthians 12:3, &ldquo;Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; From this we see that whenever a person says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he is in the Holy Spirit. The important thing to see in all of the above verses is that Christ today is the Spirit, and as the Spirit, He lives within us.</p>
<p>In what way is the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit? The Lord is within us in His person; He is a living person within us. Often we may ask the Lord to give us strength, power, or energy. We must realize, however, that the Lord never deals with us in this way. When the Lord comes to us to do something for us, He always comes to be with us as a person. Brother Nee once likened the way we view the Lord to the way a patient views a doctor. He said that many times we pray to the Lord in the same way that a sick person asks his doctor for a dose of medicine. One day we come to the Lord to ask for one dose, and the next day we come to ask Him for another dose. But Brother Nee pointed out that the Lord never gives us merely a dose; He always gives us Himself. The Lord Himself as a whole and living person is the dose. Moreover, the Lord never just gives us a little bit of Himself. When the Lord gives, He gives His whole person. Today Christ is living within us as a living and complete person.</p><h2 class="head1">APPLYING CHRIST AS THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord who lives within us is the Spirit. This Spirit is the Spirit of the Lord, the Lord Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit is also the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). What does it mean for the Spirit to be the Spirit of life? This means that the function of the Spirit today is to make Christ real to us as life. Christ is life, and the Spirit is the Spirit of life in our spirit in order to make Christ real to us as life. In addition, this life, which is Christ Himself, has a function. To illustrate this we can consider the experience of a baby. What is the first way in which the life of a baby functions? The first function of a baby&rsquo;s life is its consciousness or sense. When you speak to a baby, there is a reaction. This reaction is the consciousness, or sense, of the baby&rsquo;s life. When you put something sweet into a baby&rsquo;s mouth, the baby tastes it and swallows it. However, if you put something bitter into a baby&rsquo;s mouth, although he has never heard of the word <em>bitter,</em> he will immediately spit it out. Why is this? This is the result of the function of the sense of life. We must realize that Christ is living within us as a living person and as life. Then we must realize that this life has a primary function, which is the consciousness, the sense, of life. You may say that you do not feel Christ, but I am sure that you do have some sense of the spiritual life that is within you. This sense proves that Christ is within you. You have such a sense because you have Christ within you, and because you have Christ within you, you have such a sense. The sense of life is the simple means by which we are able to apply Christ. In fact, the sense of life is just Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Applying Christ in this way is very delicate, yet it is very simple. We can liken this to electricity. When I was a little boy, I was amazed by electricity. Electricity was so wonderful and mysterious to me, and I simply could not understand it. However, although I could not understand it, electricity was nevertheless very real. In like manner, the Lord is the Spirit, and all spiritual matters are as real as electricity. To apply electricity all we must do is turn on a light switch. If we turn on the switch, the electricity works. Similarly, the way in which we are able to experience spiritual matters and the simple means by which we can apply Christ is the sense of life. Sometimes after we have been speaking with a brother or sister for a while, we have the sense that we have spoken enough. This sense is Christ within us. Sometimes while reading the Bible we have the sense that we should stop our reading and go to pray. If after having such a sense, we continue to read and do not go to pray, then we are not applying the cross, and from that moment on it is not Christ but we who are reading the Scriptures. We are not applying Christ to our reading of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Today Christ is in our spirit as the Spirit. This Spirit is the Spirit of life, of which the primary function is the consciousness, the sense, of life. Whenever we have a sense or registration in our inner parts, we have to realize that this is Christ. When we have such a sense, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, this is You. I will go along with You. I will apply You to my living and to this very thing that I am about to do. It is no longer I who do it, but it is You who are doing it.&rdquo; The sense of life within us is Christ Himself, and by going along with the sense of life, we apply Christ to our living.</p>
<p>However, in order to go along with the sense of life there is one prerequisite&mdash;we must realize that we have been crucified and are dead, buried, and finished. We must realize that we are no longer the ones who are living, but that it is Christ who is now living within us. In order to apply Christ, we must apply the death of Christ. Each of us must realize that it is &ldquo;no longer I...but...Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). It is &ldquo;no longer I but Christ&rdquo; in the bad things and &ldquo;no longer I but Christ&rdquo; in the good things as well. Even in studying the Scriptures it is &ldquo;no longer I but Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way for us to apply Christ is to apply the death of Christ and go along with the sense of life. This must be very clear to us. Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of life is in our spirit, the primary function of life is the sense of life, and the sense of life is Christ Himself. If we go along with this sense, applying the death of the cross to our self and old man, then we will experience and apply Christ. As a result, Christ will be our life in a very practical way.</p>
<p>For many of us the matters that we have been considering in this message may be quite new. As a result, when we go to have some fellowship with a certain brother or sister, we may not remember any of this. Thus, to learn to apply Christ requires us to practice. Many of you know how to drive a car. The first time you got into the driver&rsquo;s seat, you probably did not know how to drive, but after a certain amount of practice, you became used to driving and were able to do it. Just as it requires practice to learn to drive a car, it also takes practice to learn to apply Christ in the way we have discussed above. We need to love the Lord, receive the revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal plan that Christ is life and everything to us, and take the ground that we have been buried. When we are about to have some fellowship with one of the brothers or sisters, we have to practice all these things. We should say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. You are everything in God&rsquo;s plan. I now realize that You are my life and my everything. I know that I have been buried and am finished. Right now, it is no longer I who live, but it is You who are living in me. It is not I who am going to fellowship with this brother; it is You who are going in me. I do not trust my mind. I am through, and I have been buried. Lord, at this very moment You are my life and my everything.&rdquo; This is the way that we should practice.</p>
<p>If we practice in this way and have such an attitude, there is no doubt that the Holy Spirit will be the reality to us, and we will experience Christ. Christ will have the ground and will take the opportunity to occupy our mind, emotion, will, mouth, and language. Through our practice in such a way, Christ will have the opportunity to gain His rightful place within us. He will be able to make His dwelling place within us, and we will be full of Christ. As a result, we will be right with God and at peace within. Then we will be a people whose mind, emotion, and will are filled with Christ. Deep in our emotion there will be the element of Christ. Christ will be in all our feelings. Christ will also be in our mind and our will to the extent that our thoughts will be full of Christ and our decisions will have the reality of Christ. If we become such people, do you think that we will have problems with sins and the world? We will not, because Christ will be the One living within us. We will be finished and Christ will be living, so we will have nothing to do with sins and the world. This is very simple. Now we realize where Christ is today. Christ is very close to us and is even one with us. Christ today is the Spirit in our spirit. Thus, we must practice to experience Him, contact Him, and apply Him as such a One within us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECEIVING REVELATION<br />
IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE REALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:11-12, 20; 3:1-5a, 9-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE DEPENDING ON REVELATION</h2>
<p>When we love the Lord with our heart, something happens in our spirit. We may pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, by Your grace I am constrained by Your love to love You. Lord, I would like to learn to love You. I offer You my love, my heart, and my whole being.&rdquo; When we pray in such a way, we have the sense that something wonderful is happening in our innermost being. This is the experience of being filled with the wisdom of God. Simply by loving the Lord with our heart, we are filled in our spirit with the wisdom of God. Once we have such an experience, we must look to the Lord to receive not only the wisdom but also the spiritual understanding concerning what we have experienced (Col. 1:9). We need spiritual understanding in order to understand and experience further what has happened in our spirit. This is a spiritual principle&mdash;in order to have the real experience of Christ being our life and everything, we must have the true and complete knowledge of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. If we do not have the full knowledge and revelation of Christ in God&rsquo;s plan, we will never be able to have the real experience of Christ being our life in our daily living.</p>
<p>This is why we must spend time with the Lord in prayer. We need to spend much time in the presence of the Lord to pray in a particular way concerning this very matter. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, reveal Your eternal purpose to me. Reveal to me Your plan concerning Christ. Reveal to me everything that this Christ, whom I have experienced, is. Lord, open my eyes. Give me the full understanding of Your eternal plan.&rdquo; We should practice to pray in this way every day. In fact, it would be good if we would pray this kind of prayer every day for six months. For half a year, whenever we come to the Lord, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, open my eyes. Give me the understanding that I might see, realize, and apprehend what it means for Christ to be my life. Show me Your eternal plan regarding Christ as the mystery of God.&rdquo; We should pray and pray day after day for revelation.</p>
<p>The Bible does not record very many of the prayers of the apostles, but it does record some of the prayers of the apostle Paul. If we read these prayers, we will be able to see that they have a common nature and content. Paul prayed very much that we might have the opening of our eyes, the revelation, concerning God&rsquo;s eternal plan (Eph. 1:16-19; 3:14-19). Thus, we should also ask for this. We must ask the Lord for revelation; otherwise, we will never be able to experience Christ as our life to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>More than anything else, we need spiritual light and the knowledge of revelation. We do not need the knowledge of doctrine. Our need is the knowledge of spiritual revelation with spiritual understanding. When this knowledge of revelation is impressed into our spirit, heart, mind, and entire being, it will become a controlling factor within us. It will control our whole being and direct our walk. The revelation we receive always rules us. If we have no revelation, then we are not under any control or rule (cf. Prov. 29:18). The knowledge of doctrine or teaching is nothing, but the knowledge of heavenly revelation impressed into our spirit by the Holy Spirit will be a controlling and ruling factor within us. It will even rule us day by day, causing us to be under the control of revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION THAT CHRIST IS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>The revelation that we must see is of two aspects. The first and central aspect of this revelation is that God&rsquo;s eternal plan is that Christ would enter into us to be our life (Col. 3:4). This is what God will stress to our spirit in His revelation. God strongly desires that we would realize that Christ is life to us in our spirit. This is not merely some sort of saying or doctrine; it is a spiritual fact. Christ today is in the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself (1 Cor. 15:45b). Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rdquo; and 3:18 refers to &ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Because Christ is the Spirit, we can receive Him into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22a). This is very real. The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and we can receive the Lord Spirit into our spirit and be mingled together with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the stress of the revelation of God&mdash;that Christ is life to us as the Spirit in our spirit. This is a reality, but we can realize it only by revelation. If we do not see this, we can never realize it.</p>
 <p>Merely to receive some teaching or to hear about something will not cause us to have the reality of what we have been taught or have heard. Suppose for example that someone tells you that something you own is full of germs. If you cannot see the germs, you may feel that the item is quite clean, and what they have told you will not mean anything to you. But if you are actually able to see the germs, then you will have some realization. If we have the seeing, then the facts will mean something to us. Otherwise, all we have is theory.</p>
<p>We may have heard the saying <em>Christ is our life</em> many times. In response, we may have said, &ldquo;This is wonderful; Christ is our life.&rdquo; We have heard the saying, and we have even repeated it, but does it mean anything to us? If we have not seen the reality, then it does not. Thus, we must pray, &ldquo;Lord, open my eyes. Reveal to me that Christ is my life.&rdquo; Only when we see this, will we be able to realize and experience to the full the fact that Christ is life to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION THAT<br />
WE ARE DEAD, BURIED, AND FINISHED</h2>
<p>After seeing that Christ is our life, the second aspect of the revelation that we must see is that we are dead, buried, and finished. Some may ask, &ldquo;When did we die, and when were we buried?&rdquo; We died with Christ on the cross on the day that Christ died, and we were buried on the day that we were baptized (Rom. 6:6; Col. 2:12). After someone dies, most of the time he is buried right away. With us, however, we were dead for more than one thousand years before we were buried. After being dead for over one thousand years, one day we were baptized by the church. Once a person is buried, he is completely finished. Eventually the Holy Spirit will reveal to us that we are dead, buried, and therefore completely finished. We all need such a revelation. Most of us know the doctrine that we were buried in our baptism, but we need not only the truth of this matter but the revelation. We need the Holy Spirit to reveal the spiritual fact to us that we have been buried with Christ.</p>
<p>A good indication of whether or not we have seen this revelation is how we feel about ourselves. Some may feel that they are good, while others may feel that they are evil. Both of these feelings are wrong. If someone were to ask me whether I feel that I am good or evil, I would simply answer, &ldquo;I am dead and buried. I have nothing to do with good, and I have nothing to do with evil. I am finished. I am through with good as well as with evil.&rdquo; Do we all have such a realization? One day, more than twenty-five years ago, the Lord revealed this matter to me. I was beside myself, and I could not stay in my room. I wanted to run out to the street to tell people that I had been buried and that I was through with this world. One day the Holy Spirit will reveal this to you, and it will no longer be a saying or a doctrine to you; it will be a fact, a reality, revealed to you in your spirit. You will realize that you are absolutely finished and completely through with this world. Then the Holy Spirit will also reveal to you that you have also been raised up and made alive together with Christ.</p>
<p>If you have this revelation that you are dead, buried, and finished, it will completely change your mind, thinking, understanding, apprehension, and spiritual realization. Before you receive such a revelation, you may read the Scriptures, pray, come to the meetings, and try to do good and overcome evil. In doing all these things, you will think that you are a normal Christian. When faced with evil, you will try your best to overcome, and when faced with the opportunity to do good, you will try your best to do it. This is the condition of the majority of Christians today. If, however, the Holy Spirit comes to you and reveals to you that you have been buried and raised up with Christ, you will experience a big change. After seeing this revelation, when faced with evil, you simply will not try to overcome it. You will not try to overcome it because you will have the deep realization that you have been buried and are through with this world. Likewise, when you have the opportunity to do good, since you realize that you have been buried, you simply will not try to do it. <em>Hymns,</em> #483 matches this thought. It asks, &ldquo;Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too; / What is there left for me to do?&rdquo; The answer to this question is that there is nothing left for us to do. There is nothing left for us to do, either good or bad. We are buried, finished, and through.</p>
<p>If you do not have this realization, and one of your classmates asks you to go to the movies, you would probably say something like, &ldquo;I cannot go to the movies because I do not have time. Movies are a waste of time, and they cost too much money. Also, I do not particularly like today&rsquo;s movies.&rdquo; It is not wrong to say all these things, but to answer in such a way indicates that you have not realized that you have been buried. Your answer would show that you are still very living. If, however, you were to come to me and ask me to go to a movie with you, I would not answer you. Even if you were to ask me a thousand times, you would not receive any answer. If you were to go to a cemetery and speak to the people who have been buried there, would you receive an answer? Would any of the people buried there rise up and say, &ldquo;I cannot go to the movies because I do not have any time, and because I do not like today&rsquo;s movies&rdquo;? Surely you would not receive any answer. Everyone in the cemetery is dead and buried, and there is nothing left for them to do. The same principle applies if one of your schoolmates suggests to you that you do something good to help others. If this were to happen to you, what would you think, and what would you say? In this situation you should take the attitude of one who is dead and buried.</p>
<p>We have been buried, and we have nothing to do with good or evil. The only thing we have anything to do with is Christ. We are living Christ and walking in Christ as our kingdom. We have nothing to do with anything that is outside of Christ, regardless of whether it is good or bad. We have been buried, and we are out of this world. We can even say that we have been &ldquo;buried out&rdquo; of this world. Sooner or later the Holy Spirit will show us these two aspects of this revelation&mdash;that Christ is our life, and that we have been buried with Christ. If we see this revelation, it will rule us, change us, and transfer us from one world into another.</p>
<p>Among us, we speak very much about the building up of the church. Thus, I would ask, what kind of brother is good for the building up of the church&mdash;one with a very bad temper who is proud and easily angered or one with a very good temper who is gentle and good? Which kind of brother would you choose for the building up of the church? To tell you the truth, neither a brother with a bad temper nor a brother with a good temper can be built up with others. A brother with a bad temper can never be built up with others because such a brother is a troublemaker. A brother with a good temper who is a gentleman cannot be built up with others because he is nothing but clay. He may be good, gentle, and nice, but once you pour a little hot water on him he dissolves. It is even more difficult for a gentle brother to be built up with others than for a brother with a bad temper to be built up with others, because a gentle brother is often full of criticism within. Outwardly he is gentle, but inwardly he is full of pride. The natural man, whether good or bad, is absolutely contrary to the building. In fact, anything that is out of us is contrary to God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>We all must realize the fact that in God&rsquo;s salvation, He makes Christ to be our life and He puts us to death. If we realize this reality, then regardless of what comes to us, whether it be good or bad, we will take the attitude that we are not the ones living but that Christ is the One living within us. This realization will even affect the way that we read the Bible. We may read the Bible, but how do we read it? There are two possible ways in which we can read the Bible&mdash;we can read the Bible as a natural man who does not realize that he has been buried, or we can read the Bible with the eyes and mentality of one who realizes that he has been buried and raised up with Christ. There is a real difference between these two ways of reading the Bible.</p>
<p>Once when I visited a certain place to work for the Lord, I stayed in the home of a brother and his wife. This couple loved the Lord very much and always attended the meetings. By staying in their home, I discovered that both of them had the practice of keeping a morning watch in which they rose up early to pray and read the Scriptures. One morning when we were all at the breakfast table, I asked the sister what she had read during her time of morning watch. She replied that she had read Ephesians 5, so I asked her what light she had received from this chapter. She answered, &ldquo;I received the light that husbands must love their wives in the same way that Christ loves the church. This is truly wonderful.&rdquo; Then I turned to the husband and asked him what portion of the Word he had read and what light he had received. He replied that he also had read Ephesians 5 and had received the wonderful light that wives must subject themselves to their husbands. Both the husband and the wife had read the same portion, and at the very same table the wife said that she had received the light that husbands must love their wives, and the husband said that he had received the light that wives must submit to their husbands. This made me very afraid. I feared that there would be some struggle between the two of them right there at the breakfast table. They were both believers, yet within they were very different, and there was some contradiction between them. By this we can clearly see that both of them had gone to the Word as a natural man with a natural mind. If one day they were both to receive the revelation that they have been buried and are finished, then when they came to the Word in the morning on this ground, the Holy Spirit would have the way to reveal something spiritual to them. Then they would not pay attention to things that appeal to their natural mentality.</p>
<p>One time I asked another brother what he had read during his morning watch, and he replied that he had carefully read every verse in Colossians 3. Then I asked him what he had received from his reading. He answered that he was enlightened to see that love is the bond of all perfectness and good works (v. 14). This is the truth and this sounds very nice. It is correct that love is the bond of all things. But after he answered, I asked him if he had seen anything else in this chapter. He responded, &ldquo;I simply do not understand and do not like the other things in this chapter. What I like are teachings concerning love, patience, and humility. I do not like to read about putting off the old man and putting on the new man. This kind of teaching gives me a headache. I do not understand it, nor do I like it. What is the old man, and what is the new man? I do not understand these matters, but I do like to read about love, patience, and humility.&rdquo; From such an answer we can see that when a person comes to the Word in such a way&mdash;one hundred percent on the ground of being a natural man&mdash;he can never receive any spiritual revelation.</p>
<p>When you come to Colossians 3, and every other chapter in the Bible, you must take the ground that you have been buried and raised up with Christ. Then when you come to verse 14, which speaks of love being the uniting bond of perfectness, you will check with yourself and inquire of the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, this is the kind of word that I love. Is this the word that You are speaking to me right now? If it is, I receive it from You, but if it is not, then I reject myself and open to You to receive what You would like to give me.&rdquo; If you have such an attitude when you come to the Word, the Word will be open to you and you will receive revelation in your spirit. When you take the ground of being buried and raised with Christ, you will receive revelation and you will be hidden with Christ in God (v. 3), the old man will be put off (v. 9), and the new man will be put on (v. 10).</p>
<p>Then, having received this revelation, it will become a ruling power within you throughout the entire day. This revelation will rule you, protect you, and shine upon you all day. The light that you have been raised with Christ and hidden with Christ in God, as well as the revelation that you have put off the old man and put on the new man, will rule you and protect you, keeping you away from the old man and in the new man all day long. Through this, you will experience Christ as your life and will be able to declare, &ldquo;Christ is my life, and it is Christ who lives in me. I have nothing to do with good and evil. These things are foreign to me. My business is to deal with the living Christ who is my life. Day by day, and moment by moment, I am continually taking the ground that I have been buried with Christ and raised with Him too. Christ is my life.&rdquo; You will experience Christ more and more in your daily life and will avoid the temptation to do good and to overcome evil. This may sound strange to you, but the devil will tempt you to do good. If he is successful in tempting you to do good, then he will surely be successful in tempting you to do evil. Thus, whenever the enemy comes to tempt you to do good or evil, you do not need to say a word to him. You simply need to take the ground that you have been buried and that by being buried you have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Christ. If you do this, you will experience Christ as your life and will realize how easy it is to overcome evil. In fact, in a sense you will not even overcome it; you simply will have nothing to do with it because you have been buried and are in another realm&mdash;the kingdom of Christ. In this way Christ being your life will be a reality to you, and you will live by Christ and walk in Christ. Christ will increase in you and become everything to you. In addition, you will be built together with others to be a company of believers who are builded together in the Holy Spirit and with the life of Christ to be the real expression of the Body of Christ. May we all look to the Lord that He would have a way to carry out this work in these days.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING<br />
THE INCREASE OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE BEING<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST HIMSELF</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:15-16; 1:22-23; Col. 3:10-11; Gen. 2:18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO PARTS OF THE ONE DIVINE MYSTERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In this universe there is a divine mystery, and this mystery is of two parts. The first part of this mystery is the mystery of God, which is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 2:1-2). All that God is, and everything related to God, is embodied in Christ. Thus, if you do not know Christ, you do not know the mystery of God, and if you are not in Christ, you are not in the mystery of God. Further, if you do not have Christ in your spirit, you do not have any share in the mystery of God. If you want to know God and contact God, you have to be in Christ, because everything of God is embodied in Christ and Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>The second part of the one divine mystery in this universe is the mystery of Christ. The mystery of Christ is different from the mystery of God. The mystery of Christ is the Body of Christ, the church (Eph. 3:4, 6). Thus, if you would like to meet Christ, know Christ, and receive something of Christ, you must contact the Body of Christ, the church. Just as Christ is the mystery of God, the church is the mystery of Christ. These are the two parts of the one divine mystery in this universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE STORY OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>This twofold divine mystery&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;is the story, the meaning, of the whole universe. As Christians, we must be able to tell people this. People today are busy with education and politics, but if you were to ask them what they are living for, they might be shocked. When I was in China, I met some very high ranking government officials and quietly and humbly raised this question to them. I would say to them, &ldquo;Sir, do you know what people here are working for? Do you know what you are working for?&rdquo; Quite a number of these high ranking people told me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, this is a surprising question. I cannot answer it. I do not know what we are working for here. Maybe we are working in order to eat, drink, and sleep.&rdquo; This is all that they could answer me. In China we have a little proverb that says that human life is nothing but three times of satisfaction and one time of sleeping every day. Every day we must be satisfied once in the morning, once at noon, and once in the evening. Then, at night we lie down to sleep, and the next morning we get up and repeat the same thing all over again. This is human life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask this question to educated and cultured people. I ask them, &ldquo;What is your purpose and aim?&rdquo; Often the men say that they are working for their family&mdash;for their dear wife and their little children. They say, &ldquo;I am just working for them. I would not want them to hear me say it, but I am a slave to them. Every day I work hard just for them.&rdquo; Many times these high class people have invited me to sit down with them. When I was among them, I listened to their talk. As a result, I would say within myself, &ldquo;Dear friends, you may be high-class, cultured, and even famous, but listen to your conversation. You may appear to be high, but you are too low. You may appear to be big, but you are too small. You speak nonsense, just like little children. You do not know what you are, where you are, where you are going, or what the meaning of the universe or human life is. You are absolutely childish, foolish, and in darkness. But I am so proud that I am a child of God. You are so low, but I am so high. I am in the light, I am a member of the Body of Christ, and I know the mystery of this universe and the meaning of the story of human life.&rdquo; Unbelievers may know about cars, televisions, radios, and all kinds of entertainment, but they do not know the real meaning of the universe and of human life. Do we all know this? As Christians, we all must have this realization. Christ and the church are the mystery of the entire universe. Christ and the church are the real meaning of the story of the universe and of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING THE UNIVERSAL MAN</h2>
<p>As the mystery and real meaning of the story of this universe, Christ and the church are a universal man. This universal man is very large. If you want to know the meaning of the story of the universe, you have to know this big, universal man. Ephesians 1:22-23 says, &ldquo;And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; This is the universal man. The Head of this man is the transcendent Christ&mdash;the One who fills all in all, including heaven and earth. The Body of this man is the church&mdash;the fullness of the One who fills all. This man is too big; He fills the entire universe. The Head is in the heavens and the Body, at least a part of it, is on the earth. Just consider how big the church, the Body of this universal man, is. I believe that sooner or later the Lord will open the veil to give us all a revelation that we would see and know that there is such a mysterious, universal man in this universe. This man is so mysterious and yet so real.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ, which is the Body of this universal man, is the increase of Christ. The Body of Christ is simply the enlargement of Christ, Christ increased. In Genesis 2, after Adam had been created, God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&rdquo; (v. 18). Then God brought all the animals and birds before him. As each of the living things created by God were brought before Adam, he looked at them and gave each one a proper name. He did not, however, find a counterpart among them. Then God put Adam to sleep, opened up his side, took a rib out of him, and made a woman for him. With the little piece that God took out of Adam, He made a bride, a wife for Adam and declared that this wife would be one flesh, one body, with Adam. When Adam awoke, he said, &ldquo;This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh; / This one shall be called Woman / Because out of Man this one was taken&rdquo; (v. 23). Then the two became one. Originally there was just one bachelor. Eventually there was a couple&mdash;Adam and Eve. What was Eve? As Adam&rsquo;s wife, she was the fullness of her husband. Eve was something taken out of Adam and was the same as Adam. She was the increase of Adam. In the same way, the church is the increase of Christ. The church is something that has come out of Christ. In fact, the church is exactly the same as Christ&mdash;nothing more, nothing less, and nothing different.</p>
<p>I once attended a meeting in my native city. While we were in that meeting, fellowshipping in a free way, an elderly brother came into the meeting. When he entered, another brother said, &ldquo;Brother So-and-so just came in.&rdquo; When he said this, the elderly brother answered, &ldquo;No, just half came in.&rdquo; When he said this, everyone wondered what he meant. Then his wife came into the meeting, and he said, &ldquo;Now the other half is here.&rdquo; This is a picture of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Our physical body is another illustration of the relationship between Christ and the church. Today experts are able to make artificial limbs for people who have lost an arm or a leg. However, is an artificial limb a real member of a person&rsquo;s body? It is not, because it is not something that comes out of the person but has been added. It is something foreign to the body. An artificial limb does not grow out of a person&rsquo;s body but is something that is fitted on. As a result, it is not the same as the person who wears it. A genuine part of the body has blood flowing to it, but an artificial part does not. My nose, arms, and ears are exactly the same as I am. The blood in all of my members is the same as the blood that is in me. In fact, it is not only the same as my blood, it is my blood. These physical illustrations should help us to realize what the church is to Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, the increase of Christ. The church is something that has come out of Christ and is exactly the same as Christ is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE BEING<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST HIMSELF</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Expressing Meekness Versus<br />
Expressing Christ as Meekness</h2>
<p>In these days many dear children of God have been enlightened by the Lord and are seeking the church life, the real expression of the Body of Christ. Thus, we should consider, what is the real church life? Some people would say that we have the real church life when everyone is humble, gentle, and meek. This, however, is not the church life. In China and India there are quite a number of people who live together. They love each other and are so humble and meek, and as a result, their living is very attractive to others. You would be surprised at how nice they are to each other. However, they do not know God and they do not know Christ. Some of them even worship idols and images. Is this the church life? It is no doubt that the genuine church life is full of love, humility, gentleness, and meekness, but the genuine church life is more than simply loving each other. The real church life is the life of Christ; the real church life is Christ Himself. All the humility, gentleness, and meekness in the church life must be the manifestation of Christ. It is not enough merely to have humility, gentleness, and meekness; we must have the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<p>How then can we tell the difference between Christ as meekness and meekness that is apart from Christ? Allow me to illustrate. In 1947 I returned from Shanghai to Nanking. When I arrived there, the responsible brothers came to the station to meet me. On the way from the station to the meeting hall they said, &ldquo;Oh, Brother Lee, there is a sister among us who came from such and such a place who is very spiritual.&rdquo; The brothers did not realize it, but I already knew this sister. Before she had come to Nanking, she had gone to Shanghai and had stayed there for a few days. After the brothers finished telling me about this sister, I asked them what they meant when they said that she was so spiritual. They replied, &ldquo;We have never seen a person who is as meek and gentle as she is.&rdquo; Because these brothers were very good brothers and I was very familiar with them, we could talk frankly and freely, so I said, &ldquo;Brothers, if this is the sign of spirituality, then the statue of Mary in front of the Catholic church is more spiritual than this sister. Look at that statue. How meek and gentle it is. This statue will never become angry with you. Regardless of what you do to it, it will continue to smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person has Christ as his meekness, his main characteristic is not meekness or gentleness but Christ. He is meek and gentle, but neither of these is his main characteristic. His main characteristic is Christ. When you meet him, you sense the fragrance of Christ. This is not the case with those whose meekness is not Christ as meekness. Furthermore, those whose meekness is not Christ will always be conscious of their meekness. They may have an outward expression of meekness, but inwardly they are saying, &ldquo;Look at how meek I am.&rdquo; When you have this kind of meekness, gentleness, and love, it is you who are meek, gentle, and loving, not Christ; Christ has not become meekness to you. If Christ is meekness within you, you will be very meek, but you will have no consciousness that you are being meek. If you were to hear others saying of you, &ldquo;This person is so meek,&rdquo; you would think that they were speaking of someone else. You will have no sense that you are meek. In the same way, when Christ is love to you and you love others through this love, you will not feel that you are a person who loves others. You will simply love them without feeling or sensing that you are doing so. When you feel that you are loving others, this is not Christ; it is you. When Moses&rsquo; face was shining, others saw this, but he did not. When Christ is truly manifested through us as meekness, gentleness, or love, we will not be conscious of this. In addition, our main characteristic will not be any of these things but will be Christ Himself.</p>
<p>We have to realize that it is one thing to be good or gentle and another thing to live out Christ. The church life is not a life of goodness, meekness, gentleness, or love; the church life is a life of living out Christ. The members of the Body of Christ are not members of love but of Christ Himself. We are not simply filled with love; we are filled with Christ as love. There is a big difference. To express love itself is something of our natural man, but to express Christ as love is something of the spiritual new man, which is the increase and enlargement of Christ. This is the real church life.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Crucifixion<br />
and Resurrection of Christ in Order to Have<br />
the Genuine Church Life</h2>
<p>The only way for us to have the real church life is for us to be transformed from the natural man into the new man, the spiritual man. Thus, we need to consider what it means to be transformed and how we can be transformed. Suppose I am a meek and gentle person. Then one day I receive the light that the members of the Body of Christ are not simply members who are meek and gentle in themselves. I then realize that my meekness and gentleness are something of the natural man and that I need to be transformed from being a natural man to being a new man. At that point, everything of my natural man&mdash;whether good or bad&mdash;has to be put away. I must hate and reject my meekness and gentleness. In the same way that I reject my pride, I must also reject my humility. Rather than appreciating these things, I must hate and reject them. The reason I must do this is because the meekness of my humanity and the gentleness of my natural man are versus Christ. Because I love Christ, I hate my natural love, meekness, and humility.</p>
<p>What happens when I do this? The more I hate these things, the more the Holy Spirit within me will have the ground, the chance, and even the opportunity to act, move, and work in me, and cause Christ to be lived out through me. This is the experience of the cross of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. The cross is applied to my goodness, meekness, and humility, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection causes the life of Christ to be realized in me. When we experience this, we have the church life. When there are a group of believers who know how to experience the cross of Christ and the resurrection of Christ, they are the real church life, a functioning church, and the living Body of Christ. When we reject ourselves and know the grace of God, Christ will have the full ground and opportunity within us as the Holy Spirit. Then what we live out will be nothing but Christ Himself. Christ will be expressed and Christ will be all in all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Experience of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ Solving<br />
All the Problems in the Church</h2>
<p>This experience of the cross of Christ and the resurrection of Christ will solve all the problems in the church. These problems can never be solved simply by talking or discussing. In fact, the more we talk, the more trouble we will have; and the more we discuss, the more we will quarrel. If we try to solve problems by discussing them, once one problem is settled, ten more will be caused by the way it is settled. Problems in the church can never be solved by talking and discussing. They can only be settled by the cross of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. They can be settled only when we reach the point where we can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is a crisis, and we all must pass through this crisis. The church is the increase of Christ&mdash;Christ saturated into us and mingled with us. May we all look to the Lord that He would do such a deep and subjective work within us. Then the Body of Christ will be realized and manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Genuine Church Life, the Body of Christ, Satisfying Both God and Man</h2>
<p>This is what the Lord is seeking. God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is to have the real expression of Christ, the Body of Christ, the increase of Christ. Furthermore, this is the ultimate satisfaction of man&rsquo;s spiritual experience. Unless you attain to this ultimate point, you can never be fully and ultimately satisfied. You may attain to some level of satisfaction through a certain amount of spiritual seeking and exercise; but after you achieve this satisfaction, you will still feel that you are short of something. You will never be fully satisfied until the Lord brings you to this ultimate point and you realize that you are a member of the Body of Christ. You will never be ultimately satisfied until you realize that this Body is the expression of Christ, the increase of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ. And you will never attain to this highest level of satisfaction until you are continually receiving the power of the Holy Spirit to reject yourself and give Christ as the Spirit the ground, chance, and opportunity to live in you and through you. When you reach this point, you will realize the church life. Then you will be satisfied in an ultimate way. You will say to the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, this is it. This is what You want and what I need. This is Your heart&rsquo;s desire and the very thing that I have been looking for.&rdquo; Especially in these last days, the Lord is seeking to recover the last of the divine things. Thus, we all must go along with the Lord to give Him the free way. We all must give Christ the free way, so that He can attain what He has been seeking for generations and generations. Today the Lord is still seeking after His heart&rsquo;s desire. If we really love Him, are sincere with Him, and faithful to Him, we have to give Him the free way in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE RELATEDNESS OF<br />
THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY THROUGH<br />
THE TRANSFORMING WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 2:15-16; 3:6; 4:11-16; Rom. 12:1-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S HEART&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>What is in God&rsquo;s heart, and what is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart? We all must realize that God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is the Body of Christ. This is very clearly depicted in the type of the tabernacle and the ark. The ark is a type of Christ who is the testimony and embodiment of the invisible God. With the ark there is the need of the tabernacle. Without the tabernacle, there is no place for the ark. Without the tabernacle, the ark becomes homeless because the tabernacle is the dwelling place for the ark. All the people of Israel realized this, so they did their best to offer something for the tabernacle and to work together to build up the tabernacle. Then after the tabernacle was built, the glory of God filled it immediately. This is the heart&rsquo;s desire of God. God is seeking a tabernacle for the ark. God is seeking a Body for the Head. God is seeking the church, the real church, for Christ. Christ is the ark, and the church, the Body of Christ, is the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Today people pay attention to many so-called spiritual works, but most of them neglect the heart&rsquo;s desire of God. What is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire? God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is the building up of the church, the building up of the Body of Christ. King David was called a man after God&rsquo;s heart because he was always seeking to obtain a dwelling place for God. When he became king, there was no tabernacle for the ark. The ark was like a wandering homeless person. David had a heart to seek a dwelling place, a place of rest, for Jehovah, for the ark. This matter was so pleasing to God, because this is God&rsquo;s very heart&rsquo;s desire. Moreover, David not only prepared a tabernacle, a tent, for the ark of God, he also intended to build a temple, a house, for the ark. Although David did not do the building work directly, he prepared nearly all the materials for the building of the house of God. He knew the desire of God&rsquo;s heart, so he was a man after God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Today God is seeking the same thing&mdash;a tabernacle, a temple, a house. Today God is seeking after a Body for Christ. However, although there are so many Christians on the earth, it is very difficult to meet a good number of Christians in any one place who are built together as the real expression of the Body of Christ. Everywhere you go, it is easy to meet Christians. However, it is very hard to find the real expression of the Body of Christ anywhere on earth today. This is what the Lord is after; He is seeking to have the real expression of His Body on this earth in this age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s desire is the Body of Christ, all the work of Christ and all the work of the Spirit are for the Body of Christ. Moreover, all the gifted members, all spiritual growth, and all the functions, ministries, and gifts of all the members of the Body are for the building up of the Body. Everything that God does in Christ and as the Spirit is for the Body, and everything that He gives to the church is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of Christ Being<br />
for the Creation of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The work of Christ includes His incarnation, death on the cross, burial, resurrection, and ascension. All of this work is for the Body of Christ. For example, Ephesians 2 tells us that Christ created in Himself one new man. This new man is the Body of Christ. When I was young, I had the thought that in redemption and through regeneration, the Lord created thousands of new men. This was my thought until I received the light from Ephesians 2 that the new man created by Christ in Himself is not many but one. Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;That He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; Of the thousands and thousands of people included in the two&mdash;the Jewish and Gentile people&mdash;the Lord created in Himself just one new man. Then immediately following verse 15 we are told that this one new man is a Body (v. 16). Christ is the Head, and with one head there can be only one body. Thus, the new man cannot be thousands of individual new men. The new man is a collective man, a corporate man, a universal man. The new man is too, too big, but it is still one. The creation of this new man is the reason that the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, ascended, and came down as the Holy Spirit. All of the Lord&rsquo;s work is for the creation of this new man, which is His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Holy Spirit Being<br />
to Bring the Body of Christ into Reality</h2>
<p>All of the work of the Holy Spirit is also for the Body of Christ. This work includes at least two aspects, which can be seen in 1 Corinthians 12:12-13: &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; On one hand, we are baptized into the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, we are given to drink of Him. In both cases the Spirit is likened to water. We are baptized into this &ldquo;water,&rdquo; and we also have to drink this &ldquo;water.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit is like water that we can be immersed in and a living stream that we can drink into us. These verses also reveal that we have been baptized in one Spirit into the one Body. Thus, we can realize from these verses that we are baptized in and are given to drink of the one Spirit in order to realize the Body life. The work of the Holy Spirit is to bring the Body of Christ into reality. Ephesians 2 shows us that the work of Christ is to create the Body and 1 Corinthians 12 tells us that the work of the Holy Spirit is to bring the Body of Christ into reality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Gifted Members Being<br />
for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>After the work of Christ to create the Body and the work of the Spirit to bring the Body into reality, why is there still the need for the work of the gifted members? The work of the gifted members is necessary because the Body still needs to be built up. All the gifted people who are given to the church&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;and all of their work are for the building up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The work of Christ is to create a Body for Himself, the work of the Holy Spirit is to bring this Body into reality, and all the gifted persons are given to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Growth in Life Being for<br />
the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>All our growth in the spiritual life is also for the building up of the Body of Christ. Your growth, my growth, and the growth of every believer in the spiritual life is for the building up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Here we see that we are being built up by growing up. We are built up by growing up in the life of Christ. What are we growing for? We are growing up to be built up. The more we grow up, the more we will be built up. The building up of the church depends upon the spiritual growth of every member of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Functions, Ministries, and Gifts Being for<br />
the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>All the functions, ministries, and gifts of all the members of the Body are also for the building up of the Body (Rom. 12:1-6). If you have the gift of healing, you must realize that even divine healing is for the building up of the Body. All gifts, including the gift of teaching, the gift of speaking in tongues, and even a little gift of love, are for the building up of the Body. According to Romans 12, even the love that we show to other members of the Body is a gift that is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Thus, the Word of God clearly reveals that the work of Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, all the gifted persons, all the growth of the spiritual life, and every function, ministry, and gift of every member of the Body are all for one thing&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ. The work of Christ is to create the Body of Christ in Himself. The work of the Holy Spirit is to bring the Body into existence. The gifted members&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;are given to the Body for the building up of the Body. Furthermore, all growth in life and every gift, ministry, and function of every member of the Body are for the building up of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">REGENERATION MAKING US<br />
MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now I wish to ask you, why has the Lord regenerated you? The answer to this question is the main point of this message. Why has the Lord regenerated you, and what have you become as a result of being regenerated? Some might answer, &ldquo;I am a Christian.&rdquo; Of course, this is correct. Others may say, &ldquo;I am a child of God,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a branch in the vine.&rdquo; All of these answers are correct, but we must also realize that regeneration has made us members of the Body of Christ. There is a big difference between being a member of the Body of Christ and being an individual person. Once we are regenerated, we are no longer an individual person; we lose our individuality. Once we are regenerated, we become members of the Body of Christ. If we realize that we have become members of the Body of Christ, this will change our entire Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT UP BY BEING RELATED<br />
TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>After you have heard such a word, if I were to ask you, &ldquo;What are you today?&rdquo; you might answer, &ldquo;I am a member of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; However, what would you answer if I asked, &ldquo;Are you in the Body right now?&rdquo; Consider this question, &ldquo;Are you in the Body of Christ right now?&rdquo; If I were to ask you this question, you may have some trouble answering me in a definite way. You realize that you are a member of the Body, so you cannot say no. However, you also realize that you are still so individual and independent of all the other members, so you dare not say yes either. If you were able to say yes in a definite way, then I would ask you a third question&mdash;&ldquo;Who are the ones you are related to in the Body?&rdquo; The first question is, &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; If you answer, &ldquo;I am a member,&rdquo; then I would ask you, &ldquo;Are you in the Body now?&rdquo; If you answer yes to this second question, then I would also ask you, &ldquo;To whom are you related?&rdquo; In response to this third question, some may answer, &ldquo;I am related to Christ.&rdquo; While this answer is not incorrect, consider the members of our body. Take my hand for instance. Suppose that I were to ask my hand, &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; If my hand could respond, it would say, &ldquo;I am a member of the body of this man.&rdquo; Then I would ask my hand, &ldquo;Are you in the body now?&rdquo; The hand would answer, &ldquo;Yes, I am in the body.&rdquo; Then I would ask the third question, &ldquo;To whom are you related?&rdquo; The hand would then say, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, it is quite clear that I am related to the arm on one end and to the fingers on the other end.&rdquo; Our relatedness to the other members proves that we are in the Body. If you say that firstly you are related to Christ the Head and secondly to the apostle Paul (because he was the most spiritual apostle and you like him the most), then I would say that you are not really in the Body. You are a member of the Body, but in your practical daily life, you are not in the Body. You may know the Scriptures so well, and even preach them and teach them much, but you are still an individual, independent Christian and are not related to anyone.</p>
<p>One of the leading brothers may say in response to this, &ldquo;I meet with the brothers and other believers every day.&rdquo; This may be the case, but to meet with the brothers and sisters is one thing, and to be related to the brothers and sisters is another. As a leading brother you may meet together with the brothers every day, but I would still ask you, &ldquo;To whom are you related in a definite way?&rdquo; The relatedness that I am referring to is not a matter of friendship. Friendship is not good enough. We must be related in the Spirit of Christ, in the Spirit of life. To whom are you related in the Spirit? This is something very vital.</p>
<p>We all have to be related to some other brothers or sisters in the Spirit in a definite way. The New Testament reveals that we are living stones for the purpose of being built together (1 Pet. 2:5). Stones that have been used to build a building are all related to each other. Each stone is related to at least two or three other stones. If the stones are not related, then there is no real building. If we say that we have been built up, then I would ask, &ldquo;With whom have you been built up?&rdquo; If you answer, &ldquo;The brothers,&rdquo; then I would ask, &ldquo;Which specific brothers have you been directly built up with?&rdquo; The proof that you have been built up is that you are related to some specific brothers and sisters. If you do not know whom you are related to, then I am afraid that you have not been built up. You are in the air, not in the building. If you really are built together with the saints then there will be some that you are related to. This is very practical.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING RELATED BY BEING TRANSFORMED</h2>
<p>How much we are related to the other members is not only a proof of how much we have been built up, but it is also a test of how much we have been transformed, because the more we are transformed, the more we will be united with and related to others. For example, suppose that an American brother and a Chinese brother are placed together. In the natural man it is impossible for these two brothers to be related. After one day of being together the American brother will no longer be able to go along with the Chinese brother, and the Chinese brother will no longer be able to go along with the American brother. How then can these two brothers be related as one? You may answer, &ldquo;In Christ.&rdquo; Yes, but both these brothers are already in Christ. They are both already in Christ, but one is in Christ with a Chinese mind, and the other is in Christ with an American mind. Thus, the only way for these two brothers to be related as one is to be transformed. Both of their minds must be transformed. The more these brothers are mutually transformed, the more they will be united together. Through transformation, these two brothers will grow together. Sometimes we see a brother who is very peculiar. I tell you, we can never be related to others as long as we are peculiar. To be related to others, we all have to be normal brothers and sisters&mdash;normal to the extent that there is nothing special about us. How can we become such normal Christians? The only way is to be transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFORMED BY BEING RENEWED</h2>
<p>How then can we be transformed? The way to be transformed is to be renewed. The first thing that must be renewed is our mind. Our mind is the biggest trouble-maker. In addition, we must also be renewed in our emotion and will. If I remain in my natural emotions, I will seem very peculiar to you, and after not too long a time I will no longer be able to go along with the brothers. Sometimes we see a brother who is very dear, yet we dare not commit ourselves to him because we realize that he is still so natural in his emotions. He is so good, nice, lovely, and even dear, but he has not yet been transformed in his emotions. Thus, we all must be transformed by being renewed in our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RENEWED BY DRINKING THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There is only one thing that lasts. The only thing that can last even into eternity is the Spirit. In China there is a group of co-workers who have been working together for more than thirty years. For thirty years we have been related together, especially with Brother Watchman Nee. The reason we have been able to stay related and to work together so closely for over thirty years is that we all have been learning not to go along with our mind, our emotion, or our will. We go along only with the Spirit. Over these years we all have been learning to be transformed. Without the grace of the Lord I would have split with the co-workers many years ago. Over the years there have been troubles, difficulties, and hard times, but our relatedness has been kept by our learning to go along with the Spirit. Many times, quite a number of us were together, and in tears we each told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I have to go along with You. I just have to go along. I am suffering in my emotions, and I am suffering in my will, yet I have to go along with You in the Spirit.&rdquo; You and I can never be related in the mind, emotion, and will. We can be related only in the Spirit. The Spirit must overrule and govern the mind, emotion, and will; that is, our mind, emotion, and will must be under the control of the Spirit. When I am not happy in my emotions with another dear co-worker, what should I do? Should I just go along with my emotions? I should not. Instead, I should subdue my emotions under the control of the Spirit so that the Spirit will be a spirit of the emotions, a spirit overruling the emotions, a spirit governing the emotions. Then I will be transformed by the renewing of the emotions. My emotions will become spiritual. They will be emotions under the control of the Spirit. I repeat, the only thing that is long-lasting is the Spirit. You must believe me. Our friendship must be in the Spirit so that it can last for eternity. If it is just in the emotions, then our friendship will never last. Our relatedness must also be something in the Spirit. Thus, we all have to be transformed by the renewing of our whole being through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The way to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will is to drink the Spirit. There are two aspects to our experience of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). The first aspect is to be baptized into the Spirit, just as we were baptized into water. The second aspect is to drink the Spirit. To be baptized into the Spirit is something outward, whereas to drink the Spirit is something inward. When you drink a glass of milk, it saturates your being. In the same way, when you drink the Spirit, the Spirit saturates you. What does it mean to be saturated? To be saturated simply means to be transformed. Thus, we have to drink of the Holy Spirit day by day so that He will saturate our whole being, and in so doing, He will transform our whole being.</p>
<p>This saturating of the Spirit will keep us related, and the more we are saturated with the Spirit, the more we will be related. As a result, we will realize the Body life, the church life. This is not merely some sort of doctrine or teaching. We all need to see something regarding the real life of the Body and regarding our need to be transformed by the renewing of the natural man through the Holy Spirit, of whom we are drinking day by day. In order to realize the real life of the Body, we have to be baptized by the Holy Spirit and to drink of this one Spirit. The more we drink of Him, the more we will be saturated with Him, transformed by Him; and the more we are transformed by Him, the more we will be related together and realize the real life of the Body of Christ.</p></body></html>
