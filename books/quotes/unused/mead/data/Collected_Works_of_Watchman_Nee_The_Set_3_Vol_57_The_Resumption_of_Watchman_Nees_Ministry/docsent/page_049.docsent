   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WHOLE BODY SERVING Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 15, 1948, 6:30 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker: Watchman Nee CONCERNING LEADING The Leading of the Conscience and</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Leading of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Chang Yu-zhi: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is there a difference between individual leadings and leadings in the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee: Catholicism and Protestantism belong to two different systems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Protestantism everyone is led individually by his own conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Catholicism everything is governed absolutely by the church's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Catholic Church thinks that all of God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Protestants oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They think that a man should follow God according to his free conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Protestantism rejected Catholicism, but in so doing, it brought in Sardis and paved the way for Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants His people to come out of Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also wants His people to come out of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Personal Leading Being a Matter</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of the Sense of the Inner Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible there are two instances where the matter of God's leading is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first place is the first Epistle of John, which speaks of the leading of the anointing 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second place is the book of Hebrews, which speaks of the leading in the new covenant 10:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The former emphasizes the knowledge of spiritual senses, whereas the latter emphasizes the knowledge of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new covenant teaches us to know God's law, whereas the anointing teaches us to know the way to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only when we live before God do we know His law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We make judgments concerning everything by the responses of the inner life, not by outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same principle we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him by the anointing, not by outward teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to be careful to realize that these leadings concern only our knowledge of God before Him; they do not include all other kinds of leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not careful and if we generalize these leadings to mean all kinds of leadings, concluding that all kinds of leadings come directly and independently from God, we will have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First John and Hebrews are on the leading concerning the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As to the leading concerning the Lord's way on earth, we have to look at the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mistake of Catholicism lies in the fact that it not only holds a tight rein on the leading concerning the way of the church, but also takes over the leading of the individual consciences.</S>
