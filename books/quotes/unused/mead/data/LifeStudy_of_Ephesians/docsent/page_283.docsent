   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL WARFARE A MATTER OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In God s economy there is one army constituted of a corporate warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the warrior in Ephesians 6 is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only as a corporate entity, the Body, can we put on the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is contrary to the concept held by many Christians that an individual believer is able to wear the entire armor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The armor in Ephesians 6 is not for Christians as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What this chapter reveals is not the believers fighting as individuals, but a corporate army fighting the battle for God s interests on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, a corporate entity to fight the battle against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No soldier in a modern army would enter into battle by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, he would fight as part of a well-trained and fully equipped army.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we have been formed corporately into an army, we shall be able to fight against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s strategy is to use the church as His army to fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, it is very dangerous to be isolated from the army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by remaining in the army will we have the necessary protection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Years ago, the Lord s people regarded spiritual warfare as an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But through the years we have seen that it is altogether a matter of the church as God s corporate army.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you separate yourself from the church, you will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan s strategy is simply to isolate you from the church as God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is crucial for us to realize that spiritual warfare is a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we realize this and stay with the church, we shall be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The battle is not for us as individual believers; it is for the church as God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EMPOWERED IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God s warrior, the church does not fight by her own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 6:10 says, For the rest, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse indicates clearly that we should not fight in our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, we must be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word rendered empowered has the same root as the word power in 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To deal with God s enemy, to fight against the evil forces of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised up Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>PUTTING ON CHRIST AS THE ARMOR</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Ephesians 6, the Lord with His might is the very armor that we put on for our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that we, as the Body, need to put on Christ Himself as our armor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to fight in the spiritual warfare, we must have Christ as the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 6:14-17 there are six aspects of Christ as armor: the girdle of truth, or reality; the breastplate of righteousness; the firm foundation of the gospel of peace the shoes ; the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the whole armor of God consists of the girdle, the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The shield is for defense, whereas the sword is for offense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, the sword is the only item of the armor that is for offensive warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>APPLYING THE ARMOR BY PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to verse 18, we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, prayer is the means by which we receive all the aspects of the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know how to apply the girdle of reality?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is by praying in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Prayer is also the way to apply the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword.</S>
