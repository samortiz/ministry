 <h2 class="head1">THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE LORD<br />
BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word was God Himself embodied to be Jesus. When Jesus speaks the word, whatever He speaks is spirit and life. The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Word today is the Spirit and the life. Because it is the Spirit, it is also life. When the Lord brought me into the line of life many years ago, I saw John 6:63. From that day my understanding of the Bible was absolutely revolutionized. From that day I never considered the Bible as something merely printed in black and white. Instead I began to consider the Bible as the living Spirit and life itself. If we contact the Bible only with our mind, the Bible will be only the letter to us. But whenever we contact any part of the Bible with our spirit, that part of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT FLOWING IN AND WITH THE WORD</h2>
<p>The Spirit flows in and with the word (John 7:38-39). The Gospel of John has a very good sequence. The sequence in John&rsquo;s Gospel is not according to history or according to doctrine, nor is it according to the standard of morality like the Gospel of Luke. John&rsquo;s sequence is according to spirituality. Chapter one tells us clearly that the Word was God. Then in chapter six, the word is something that comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ. Whatever comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit and life. In chapter seven the Spirit becomes a flow (vv. 38-39). First there is the Word, then the Word is the Spirit, and finally the Spirit is a flow.</p>
<p>John 7 says that rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being. The Lord tells us clearly that this flow out from our innermost being is the Spirit. With what does the Spirit flow from deep within us? This Spirit, who is the flow and who flows from within us, flows with the word. When we speak the living word, bubbling with the word, the Spirit flows with the word we speak. If we do not have the proper word with which to speak, the Spirit cannot flow out of us. This is why Paul tells us that we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). We must have a living storage of the word. Then when we speak, the words that are stored within us will become water. When the word comes out of us, water comes out. The Spirit can flow in and with the word. The more we speak the word, the more the Spirit flows.</p>
<p>The Word, God, and the Spirit are altogether one. In John 1 God was the Word, who was in the beginning. In John 20, the Lord Jesus Himself became a Spirit that was breathed into the disciples. In between John 1 and John 20, there was a process. The Word became flesh, and whatever this One spoke was the Spirit. The Spirit flows with the word. Eventually, this One went to the cross, was crucified, and through resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) as the very breath that could be breathed into our inner being. Thus, John shows us the Word as God becoming flesh, and eventually this very Word becomes the Spirit. Today the very Word whom we speak is God Himself, Jesus Christ Himself, and the Spirit Himself. The Word is the Triune God.</p>
<p>This Word has gone through a process. The Triune God is the very essence of this Word, and this essence is altogether contained in the Spirit. God is the Word, the Word became flesh, and this Word today is the Spirit, so we all have to exercise our spirit. Then we have to learn how to exercise to speak this wonderful Word, which is the Triune God. In Ephesians 6:17 Paul refers to &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&rdquo; The antecedent of &ldquo;which&rdquo; is &ldquo;the Spirit,&rdquo; indicating that the Spirit is the word of God. The Lord Jesus indicated that the word is the Spirit, and Paul said that the Spirit is the word. This is like saying Paul is the apostle and the apostle is Paul. The Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. These two are really one.</p>
<p>We must learn to speak this kind of word. To learn to speak any language, we must exercise to speak. Do not care about making mistakes. Your speaking will correct and improve you. We should not expect the new ones in a home meeting to speak so correctly. Children learn to speak by making mistakes. The more they speak, the more they learn to speak. Not much adjustment of their speaking is needed. Children also learn to walk and run by their exercise. First, they crawl until eventually they learn to stand up. Then through much trial and error, they learn to walk and then to run. All of us can learn to speak by exercising to speak.</p>
<p>We must endeavor to have a meeting without a definite speaker. We must put aside the practice of a single speaker in our church meetings. When I hear the saints speaking in a meeting, I may hear incorrect things. But eventually the saints correct themselves when they continue to speak. Sometimes I had the feeling to correct someone, but I decided not to. If we correct too much, no one will speak. Our correcting may make others afraid to speak. It is better to give others the freedom to make mistakes. When you go to a home meeting, do not correct the new ones. Let them speak. As long as they speak, that is marvelous.</p>
<p>In the full-time training in Taipei, I charged the trainees not to go to the home meetings of the new ones and become their pastor. It is possible to make yourself the new ones&rsquo; pastor without having the title of a pastor. Recently in Taipei, we began to have district meetings with at least fifty attendants in one district meeting. Among these fifty there might have been ten to twelve good speakers. I charged these saints not to become a &ldquo;corporate pastor&rdquo; of twelve persons in the district meeting. If these twelve do all the speaking, they become a corporate pastor. This practice can also annul the functions of the saints. We must try to speak in a way that leads and guides all the rest to speak. When the other saints open up their mouths to speak, let them continue the speaking. Give others the ground to speak, and do not try to correct them. If you correct them, they may stop speaking and the flow will be cut off. Treasure their speaking and even their making of mistakes. Let them speak with the view of their being perfected in their function.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the saints need to be balanced in their functioning. Some may like to talk all the time, and they may speak too much. These saints may need some correction and adjustment. Most of the saints do not need this kind of balancing word. They need to be balanced by learning to speak. In Hosea 7:8 the Lord likened Israel to an unturned cake. Cakes that are baked need to be baked on both sides. Many saints may be &ldquo;baked&rdquo; on one side, but not on the other. We all have to be turned cakes. If you shout too much in the meetings, you have to be balanced not to shout that much. If you would not shout at all, you have to be balanced to shout. If you shout too low, you have to be balanced to shout louder. If you shout too loud, you need to be balanced to lower your voice. The burning young ones, however, should not be balanced too quickly. If you balance them too fast, the burning fire will be quenched, and this fire may not come back.</p>
<p>Because I speak so much, I make mistakes. The more one speaks, the more mistakes he will make. The best way not to make mistakes is not to speak. The less one speaks, the less mistakes he makes. This is the philosophy of the Chinese culture. The Japanese are also very quiet according to their natural constitution in their culture. No matter what culture we come from, we all have to deny our self and our natural constitution by exercising to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.</p>
