   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we enjoy Him as our dwelling place and as our roommate, we have light, air, water, food, and everything that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I am away from my home, the place where I stay may have many things, but it does not have what I have at home to meet my needs.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our home today is a person Christ, who is also God's dwelling place.</S>
