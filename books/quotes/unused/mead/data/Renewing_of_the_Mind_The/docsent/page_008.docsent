   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Considering One's Past</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The biggest fault of a believer is thinking about his past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Believers think that introspection is good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, introspection cannot enable us to know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is not one believer who acquires self-knowledge by looking into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The knowledge of one's self comes from God's light; only after he receives God's light will he know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have spoken in detail concerning the matter of self-knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please see "Self-knowledge and God's Light" in The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Self-criticism, self-analyzing, or any thought concerning the self, whether good or bad, causes one's mind to become restless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not secretly compare ourselves to others, no matter who it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time a believer looks at himself he will have no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consider a person walking along the road: if he looks at himself, he will stop going forward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He cannot look at himself and walk forward at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, whoever looks at himself is either going backward or standing still.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The same is true in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you always consider yourself, eventually you will be very discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If no one leads you on, you will put yourself in a dangerous position, and you may even think that you are not saved, that you have committed an unforgivable sin, or that God has forsaken you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these are the results of your introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the condition of an unrenewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unable to Minister Well</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the Word of God to Others</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our nous has not been renewed, we cannot minister to others what God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some believers are very capable in conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how many matters are being discussed, they can relate them one by one in proper utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They truly have eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when you ask them to talk about spiritual things or about the truth, they cannot explain even one thing to others clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is that their mind is not qualified to be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their mind is like a child's arm which cannot bear anything that weighs more than ten pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their nous is too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Though they have many thoughts, they are all without order.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They cannot understand what comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They understand what they receive in their intuition, but they cannot compose what they understand into a proper teaching in order to share with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because their nous has not been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God wants us to speak forth His Word, He will certainly give us the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But even though this is necessary, if a person does not have a renewed nous, he cannot express what he has received within him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a believer has his nous enlightened but not completely renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such, he cannot put together God's Word and minister it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot regard such a one as our pattern, and we cannot presume that being enlightened once is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should have a clearer understanding day after day and should be able to use words to express what we know inwardly, so that others may understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A believer needs to have a renewed nous to guide him through his days on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, he will suffer loss and damage in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will think wrongly of others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will not be able to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will also think wrongly of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will not be able to properly live his life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why everyone needs to seek after the renewing of the nous in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the people in the world, there are only two categories: the saved and the perishing, the regenerated and the unregenerated, those in Christ and those in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These differences are absolute; the two are completely dissimilar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In like manner, with the nous of the believers, there is also the renewed nous and the unrenewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is an absolute boundary between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are saved, our nous must also be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the renewing of the nous should not occur just once, but daily.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are like this, we will be very clear concerning God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once Mr. Moody was walking on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suddenly, he went into the house of one of his neighbors and asked to be allowed to go upstairs to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The owner of the house agreed, and he went upstairs and prayed to God, "O God, Your hand should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It's too much; I cannot bear it."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you daily have a renewed nous, you will see that you cannot bear what God shows you of yourself through your nous.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I say again, you should do this singleheartedly, just as you did when you were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If your regeneration has caused a change in your living, your nous should also be enlightened in a specific way and be renewed daily.</S>
