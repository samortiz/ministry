   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There Is a Way When We Meet the Lord Ch'ang-ch'un</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Zuo-xin and I have received some light; we are serving God in one accord with Brother Xun-tian and Brother Xi-nian, and there is not the slightest problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more we go on, the clearer the way becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church in Ch'ang-ch'un has been blessed by the Lord more than we could ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There have been a total of four weeks of message meetings with two breaks for days of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's own word came upon us and resolved all kinds of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We saw some matters in the Word for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today is a great day because God is coming forth!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He establishes what is of Himself, and He tears down what is not of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not allow us to continue serving Him in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The day in which God speaks is the day in which His light shines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can only worship Him and give ourselves more to Him while waiting for His cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am in more fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have such a great responsibility because we hold the spiritual future of so many brothers and sisters who are pursuing the Lord in our hands!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am so poor and weak in myself!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After returning, I have had a time of prayer and spiritual pursuit with the brothers every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, I desire to be an unwavering and uncompromising person for the sake of the Lord's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But on the other hand, I want to pour myself out in loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I want to be faithful, but I do not want to hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I deeply feel that all work begins from our service before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we meet the Lord we have the way, and once we meet Him we have the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our plans are not the way, and our doctrines are not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Indeed we do not move in ourselves, we can only move when He moves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know how many tears I have shed while I have been looking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot make any more mistakes in the spiritual work in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we make another mistake, we may not have another opportunity to serve for the rest of our lives!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, I am bringing my scars to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We wait on Him in fear and trembling concerning all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hymn #188 has become our prayer for this fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the principle of Antioch, I have recently felt that Barnabas and Saul were sent out and the brothers commended Paul and Silas to the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostles were the sent ones of the church, so there should be a sending church, and they should go forth in the spirit of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I really say "amen" to having no workers in the central church because the workers are always sent out and commended to the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spiritual center chosen by God is the center of God's work, and the apostles are sent out in a spirit of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I really feel that the Lord has prepared Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the work in Manchuria as well as the work in Ch'ang-ch'un should proceed according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If it does not, there will not be much blessing or protection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This has been my main consideration, and I dare not be relaxed in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With regard to my occupation, chicken farming takes up too much of my time, and other occupations require too much thought.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I want a job that does not require much thought.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want a change in occupation, one that exercises my physical body instead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is a brother in Harbin who owns a bakery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I plan to go there for two or three months to learn how to make bread on the one hand and to serve the brothers and sisters on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps I will start a bakery in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you think it will be practical?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have already fellowshipped with the brothers, and everyone is seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Zuo-xin also plans to go to Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the ministry of the word, Brother Xi-nian is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Wang Xing-yu is bearing some responsibility for the edification of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are a few brothers who are able to serve in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This conference really showed us the right way, and the preaching of our gospel is with more zeal now.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since I left Ch'ang-ch'un, the brothers are better able to carry out their functions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hua Tien-min</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>July 17, 1950</S>
