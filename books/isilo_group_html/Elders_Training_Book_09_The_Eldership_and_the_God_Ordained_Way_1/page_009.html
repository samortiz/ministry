Acts 2:46 tells us that the early Christians broke bread from house to house. The Greek text also can mean that they broke bread "according to their homes." Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to preach and to teach Christ as the gospel. Their gospel was not a theology nor mere doctrine. Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost. They preached this opposed One as the gospel and they also taught. These two verses are critical. Another crucial verse is 1 Corinthians 14:26. This verse tells us that when the church comes together, each one should have something. This one has a psalm, another one has a teaching, another one has a revelation, etc.</P><P>By these three verses, we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers' meetings in the early days of the church. This situation and condition cannot be seen in today's Christianity. Even we ourselves are very short of this God-ordained way to practice the church life. First, the early believers practiced the church life according to their homes. This means that the church life at that time was in the believers' homes. Second, when the whole church came together, it was not a meeting in which one person spoke and the rest listened. Their church meetings were full of mutuality. Each one should have something of the Lord to share with the others for the building up of the church. Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today's Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us.</P><P>This is why by October of 1984, I was forced to reconsider what is in the Bible, what we are doing, and what we see in today's Christianity. My eyes were once more enlightened to see God's ordained way to build up the Body of Christ. Surely Christianity has deviated from this way. We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word. Thus, I was strong to make a decision that we needed to have a great change, a revolutionary change.</P><P>The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen. Hierarchy, organization, and clergy are the factors that have killed and even cut Christ's Body into pieces. Doctrinal factors have not done the damage that these three things have done. These three things mainly depend on the present practice of Christianity. If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
