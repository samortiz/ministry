   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. No More Sea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the new heaven and new earth appear, there will be no more sea Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sea is the source of the demons, which keep things away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since Satan's rebellion, God has been continually working to eliminate the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 1 God limited the water of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the centuries, God has done much to reduce the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time a sinner is saved, the sea is limited a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a hundred sinners would be saved today, the sea would be limited a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, the sea will be reduced to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The source of the things which have kept heaven and earth away from God will be no more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. No More Tears, Death,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sorrow, Crying, and Pain</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 21:4 says, "And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain they shall be no more; for the former things have passed away."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the sea is no more, there will also be no more tears.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All tears come from the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the sea has been dried up, it will be impossible for us to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, there will be no death, which includes sickness and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 1 Corinthians 11, we first have weakness, then sickness, and finally death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To say that there will be no more death also means that there will be no more weakness and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sea is the source of death, weakness, and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the sea has been eliminated, there will be no more tears, no more death, no more weakness, and no more sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, there will be no more sorrow, crying, or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may have read the Bible for years, you have probably never realized that the source of sorrow, crying, and pain is the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritually speaking, the sea causes all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the sea is no more, these things also will be no more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. No More Curse</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 22:3 says, "And there shall no longer be any curse."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today on earth there is a curse almost everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the day is coming when there will be no more curse, for the source of the curse the sea will be dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>E. No More Night</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 22:5 says, "And night shall be no more."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To say that there is no more night means that there is no more darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under God's universal blessing everything will be bright and crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There will be no darkness, no opaqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the condition of the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to apply all these aspects of the universal blessing to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In your life is there still the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are there still tears, death, weakness, and sickness?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are there sorrow, crying, pain, the curse, and darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If these things are in your life, it indicates that you are short of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come to the life of Joseph, we shall see that in his life there was no darkness, opaqueness, or curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the result of his being put into prison was not a curse, but a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although he was persecuted by his brothers, the issue of that persecution was blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we may have a foretaste of the new heaven and the new earth in which there is no curse, only blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we still quarrel with our wife or husband, we are under the sea, death, weakness, sickness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are in a thick night without light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But suppose in our married life there is neither quarreling nor complaining, but praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the sea in our married life has been dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One characteristic of Joseph is very striking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although he suffered a great deal, he never complained.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he made himself known to his brothers, he seemed to say, "It was not you who sent me here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I don't complain against you I praise God."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With Joseph, there is no complaining, only praising, because he was under the blessing, not under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you complain, it is a sign that you are still under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may have many reasons to complain, but every reason is a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you are one under God's blessing, there will be no complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of complaining, you will say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything works for good to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is easy to read the Scriptures in an objective, doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we need to see that the things recorded in the Bible are for us even today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not wait for the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today we can live in a foretaste of the conditions of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can live without complaint, blame, curse, or darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can have a life full of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All our tears may be tears of joy, not tears of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a miniature of the universal blessing which we may enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The word "universal" means that blessing is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not mean that I am blessed when my wife is good to me and cursed when she is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether or not something is a blessing does not depend on your wife it depends on you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you complain, the way your wife treats you will be a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you praise the Lord, it will be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let me tell you a secret: Our praises turn the curse into blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the reason the New Testament tells us to thank the Lord for all things Eph 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This includes rumors, persecution, defamation, opposition, and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to praise God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we praise Him for all things, even the unpleasant things become good things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we thank the Lord for the opposition, it becomes a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the secret of enjoying the universal blessing today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although we are living in a dark age we may have a foretaste of life in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It all depends upon our realization and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we practice praising instead of blaming, we shall be under the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, we shall be under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hallelujah, in the church we are in a miniature of the new heaven and new earth!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Everything here is a blessing.</S>
