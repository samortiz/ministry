<h1 class="series">THE PRAYER MINISTRY<br>OF THE CHURCH</h1><H1 CLASS=MSG>PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</H1><P>This book contains five messages concerning prayer. The title is taken from the first chapter. Through these messages we hope that God's children will learn to pray with His eternal purpose as the center and learn to carry out the responsibility and authority God has given the church to withstand Satan's attack against prayer. May God gain prayer warriors to co-labor with Him.</P><P>The Taiwan Gospel Book Room</P>
