   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A THIRSTY SAVIOR AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A THIRSTY SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The case of the Samaritan woman reveals that Christ is real satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While Nicodemus was a pure-blooded Jew, the Samaritan woman was of mixed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything related to her was a ruin; nothing was pure or good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Samaritans claimed to be the descendants of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At most, they were his descendants by mixed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While the name of Nicodemus is given, no one knows the name of the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because she was mean and low, the Bible does not divulge her name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She was altogether a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She was an extraordinary case among all of the cases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you read the Bible carefully, you will find that everything about her was extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even her coming out to the well to draw water was extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the custom in the Middle East, the women come to draw water in the late afternoon, not at noontime.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the sun is going down, the women come to draw water in companies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this Samaritan woman came to draw water at noontime by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why did she do this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because she had a bad name, and no one would keep company with her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She was afraid of being talked about, of being criticized, and she did not dare come in the late afternoon when so many other people would be there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She came at noon when the sun was blazing and when no one else would come out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This woman was poor and immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She had had five husbands and was living with one that was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one cared for her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She knew this and came to draw water at such a lonely time, expecting that no one would see her.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the case of the Samaritan woman there are many signs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The case itself is a sign, but within this sign, there are many signs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The case itself signifies that Christ is our satisfaction, but one of the signs within the case is the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the types and figures in the Scriptures, what does a woman signify?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Firstly, a woman signifies that humanity needs to rely upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man can never stand alone; he must rely upon God, who is both his Maker and Husband Isa 54:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers, allow me to ask you this question: Is your standing before God that of a male or a female?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you were to ask me, I would tell you that although I am a man of over sixty years of age, I do realize that my standing before God is that of a female.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My position before God is not that of a man, but of a woman, because I can never stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I need God to rely upon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A woman signifies a person who cannot stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is both your position and mine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In figure, we are either males or females, but in reality we are all females.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>None of us can stand by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nowadays people proclaim independence, but I must tell you that you can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You were created to be dependent upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever anyone tries to be independent, he will be dissatisfied, because God created man inherently dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A woman also signifies weakness 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We human beings must realize that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are all weak because we are all human.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that your wife is a weak vessel and that you are a strong one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although this may be true figuratively, in fact both men and women are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In some cases, as far as spiritual things are concerned, the brothers are weaker than the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus was about to be betrayed and put to death, the sisters in the New Testament were stronger than the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sisters were much stronger at the time of the Lord s death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in loving the Lord, Mary was the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So, brothers, do not proudly think that you are the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are all human and we were all made weak and dependent so that we would have to rely upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The significance of a woman also includes an inner longing and thirst, which were created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, a man has the need for a wife as a helpmate, but a woman needs a husband much more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A woman always has the longing and desire to have satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the human nature of both man and woman, there is always the inner thirst for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord created that thirst so that we might seek Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You always feel thirsty and you always feel an inner lack.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These are the signs that you are a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Your need to rely on others and your sense of dependence, weakness, and thirst for satisfaction all indicate that you are a woman.</S>
