One of the sufferings of the church in Smyrna is the slander from those who call themselves Jews. Who are these ones who call themselves Jews? According to Romans 2:28-29 and John 8:39-47, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus sincerely from their heart are the true Jews. Those who call themselves Jews are, of course, not the true Jews. They are those who are Jews in the flesh only. The Judaizers are those who have come into the church but have not genuinely believed in the Lord and His salvation. Instead, they try to introduce Judaism into the church. They have been blaspheming the Lord since the day He was on earth. After the church was produced, they continued to slander the apostles. Their slander was actually a reviling of the word of the gospel (Acts 13:45; 18:6; 19:9; 28:22; Rom. 3:8). We will call these ones the Judaizers. They are not ordinary Jews. They creep into the church with the intention of mixing Judaic thoughts with the truth.</p><p>In Revelation the Lord shows that the first group of people who frustrated the church were the Judaizers in Smyrna. By then it had become a "synagogue of Satan." The Judaizers were organized and utilized by Satan to damage the church. When we come to the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3:9, we find these ones continuing to disrupt the church. From church history we see that Christianity has been very much frustrated by Judaism. Once Christianity lets down its guard, Judaism creeps into the church. The Old Testament priesthood was transformed into the pastoral system of the congregations. The law became the standard of one's conduct. The festivals became ritualistic days which men had to keep. This mixture of Judaism began from the time of the church in Smyrna and was not checked until the time of the church in Philadelphia. The work of the Judaizers during that period appeared mainly in the form of the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Thank the Lord that in the nineteenth century a group of people was raised up. They overcame Judaism. These ones belonged to the church in Philadelphia. But today there are still works of the Judaizers in the church. These people preach some very serious heresies. We have to pay close attention to them. We want to consider the three great errors of the Judaizers under three headings. The first concerns their heretical stand with regards to the law. The second concerns their attitude towards the Lord's redemption. The third concerns their attitude towards life after death and the future judgment. We have to spend some time to study the teaching of the Judaizers so that new ones can identify their errors and deal with them when they encounter them.</p><h2 class="head1">HERETICAL TEACHING WITH REGARDS TO THE LAW</h2><h2 class="head2">General Heretical Teachings of the Judaizers<br />regarding the Law</h2><p>First, let us consider the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law. They base their heresy on the Old Testament law which is of two kinds, ceremonial and moral. The Lord came to annul the ceremonial ordinances. This means that He annulled the ceremonial law, but He kept the moral law. The Judaizers say that we should keep the Ten Commandments. Since the fourth commandment is the keeping of the Sabbath, they say we should keep the Sabbath as well. They say that the Sabbath should be kept on Saturday, not Sunday. Let us see if this teaching is Scriptural. We are not here to argue but to examine if a teaching is heretical. If it is, we have to be careful. In order to study the Judaizers' heresy regarding the law, we have to know the Scripture's teaching regarding the law.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 86</div><br></body></html>
