SATAN ATTACKING JOB,<br>AND JOB SUFFERING TRIALS IN THE MATTER<br>OF HIS POSSESSIONS AND CHILDREN</H2><P>In Job 1:12b-19 we see that Satan attacked Job and that Job suffered trials in the matter of his possessions and children.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A.

The Oxen and the Donkeys Being Taken Away</H2><P>One day, when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother, a messenger came and reported to Job that the Sabeans had fallen upon the oxen and the donkeys and had taken them away, striking the servants with the edge of the sword. Only the messenger had escaped to relate these things to Job (vv. 13-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Fire of God Devouring the Sheep</H2><P>While this messenger was still speaking, another came and reported that the fire of God had fallen from heaven and had burned up the sheep and the servants and had devoured them.

A Great Wind Causing the Death<br>of Job's Sons and Daughters</H2><P>While this messenger was still speaking, another came and reported concerning Job's sons and daughters. They were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother; and suddenly a great wind came from beyond the desert and struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died. Only the messenger had escaped to relate these things to Job (vv. 18-19). The great wind was probably a whirlwind. Like the fire, it was a natural calamity instigated by Satan.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
