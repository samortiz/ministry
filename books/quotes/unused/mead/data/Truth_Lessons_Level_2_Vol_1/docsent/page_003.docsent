   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit of man was specifically formed by God as the deepest part in the entire being of the created man; it is the receiver for man to receive God and an organ for man to contact God and all the spiritual things, in order that man may substantiate the things of God and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zechariah 12:1 says that Jehovah stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although God did not put His life into man, He created man with a free will that man might exercise his own will to choose Him and to obtain His life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, He placed man in front of the tree of life, and He also set the tree of the knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life, thus affording man the opportunity to make a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man could either choose God, who was signified by the tree of life, or he could choose Satan, who was signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man was also charged to guard the ground, to protect the garden from God s enemy, that is, to deal with Satan by God s authority that the garden might not be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was with such a man who was without sin, who had a spirit and a free will, and who was assigned to dress and guard His garden, that God made the first covenant with man.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT A. God Desiring Man to Receive the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s eternal intention is to work Himself into man, whom He created, to be man s life and content that He may have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, after man was created, God put him in front of the tree of life and commanded him, saying that he could freely eat of every tree of the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:16-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tree of life is a symbol, signifying God as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This matter is clearly revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John tells us that in Him Christ was life 1:4 , that He came that man might have life 10:10 , that He is life 11:25 , and that He is the unique true vine in the universe 15:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The tree of life signifies God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just as God s life is the content of the tree of life, so also Satan s evil life and nature are the contents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, sin entered into the world through him Rom 5:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of sin and death; it includes good, evil, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If man were to contact it, he would touch the source of sin and death, and this would surely issue in sin and death.</S>
