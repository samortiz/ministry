   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE THREE TRANSFORMED AND PERFECTED IN THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:9-11, 15; 2:1-2 THE NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to a point that is greatly missed and neglected by today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This point is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 12:2 says, Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then 2 Corinthians 3:18 says that we are to be transformed into the image of the glory of Christ by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The One who transforms us is the Lord Spirit, the very God who is today the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Spirit is a compound divine title like the Father God .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I came to the United States, my burden was with three main items.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first item was the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first conference of the Lord s recovery in the United States was on the all-inclusive Christ, based upon three verses from Deuteronomy 8 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, I told people that this all-inclusive Christ is today the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second item with which I had a heavy burden to tell God s elect was the truth concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The third item was transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I spoke on the all-inclusive Christ during the last seven days of 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The next day, January 1 of 1963, I was brought by a brother to Whittier to share with a group of seeking ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My burden was to share the truth and experience of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today I am still speaking on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Stanza 6 of Hymns, #548 says: Transformation is my need, / To be broken more indeed, / That the clay may change in form, / To the treasure to conform.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were made as an earthen vessel, but this vessel should be transformed in its appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Transformation is not a kind of outward reformation or correction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Transformation is a metabolic change in the substantial form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the previous message, we saw that in the universe today two worlds are going on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One is Satan s cosmos, Satan s satanic system, to systematize all the fallen people into his hands to form his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the United Nations is a great part of the cosmos of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan built up his evil world by seducing man whom God created for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam accepted Satan, so Satan as sin came into Adam to be Adam s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 5 says that sin came in through one man v. 12 . Satan, sin, and the fallen man are now one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible the fallen man is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 6 says that all men became flesh v. 3 . Satan, sin, and the flesh are the satanic trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These three coordinate together as one to build up Satan s evil kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first appearance of this kingdom was Babel, which was established by Nimrod.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nimrod was a Cushite, and Cush is today s Ethiopia.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God came in and scattered the rebellious ones at Babel, but He had not yet terminated the evil cosmos of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, Egypt rose up to be a world power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The children of Abraham, God s chosen people, went down to Egypt and stayed there for more than four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>History tells us that they were also under the domination of Medo-Persia, Greece, and eventually Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even today the whole world is under Romanism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While Satan is building up the world, his cosmos, by his satanic trinity Satan, sin, and the fallen man , God is working in His Divine Trinity to build up another world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan s world is altogether physical; God s world is altogether private and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These two worlds are still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Among the many people who became flesh are those chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These people are God s elect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God did not do anything to visit man in a direct way for the first four thousand years of man s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was two thousand years from Adam to Abraham, and two thousand years from Abraham to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then God suddenly came to visit man by incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God came to the fallen race, including His fallen elect, in a very personal and affectionate way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He left His throne in the heavens and laid aside the form of God, temporarily and secretly hiding His divinity, to become a humble man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God visited His elect in His human living for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Creator, the Almighty God, was on this earth living in His human shell as a little man to visit many people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He visited Peter, John, His mother, His mother s sister, His cousins, and His fleshly brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was very personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They did not realize who He was or what He was doing in His visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day He went to the cross to terminate the old creation including the fallen humanity, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through His death the physical Jesus was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The physical Jesus was God becoming a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Jews thought that Jesus was finished, but after three days this finished Jesus came out in resurrection in a transformed form.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first one to be transformed was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was transformed from the physical form to the spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the evening of the day of resurrection, He came to His disappointed disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus suddenly appeared in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He also did this again eight days later John 20:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Did He appear to the disciples physically or spiritually?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was able to come into an enclosed room, but He also told Thomas to touch His hands and His side.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is He physical or spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can only say that He is the wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But after His ascension, He does not visit His seekers physically.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can testify that we were visited by Him spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Jesus was physical before the day of Pentecost, but the Christ who was preached beginning from Acts 2 became spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The twenty-two Epistles from Romans through Revelation do not teach a physical Jesus; instead, they teach a spiritual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This spiritual Christ is for producing His members by transforming sinners into spiritual men for the raising up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The churches are a bridge to bridge God s transformed people from the physical side to the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today the churches have a physical form and a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Ephesians 1 speaks of the church, which is His Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>22b-23a .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The essence of the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When a man dies, his corpse remains but the essence of his person is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is here in his corpse physically, but he is gone in his essence, his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Likewise, the church has two sides: the physical side and the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The physical side is the church as the house of God, and the spiritual side is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>First Timothy 3:15 speaks of the church as the house of God physically speaking, and Ephesians 1:22-23 reveals the church as the Body of Christ spiritually speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not the church which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, the Body of Christ, as a precursor of the holy city, will consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The New Jerusalem is altogether not a physical city but a spiritual, organic constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Before we were saved, we were merely physical beings in a physical world, but one day Jesus visited us privately in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We received Him and He regenerated us privately, secretly, and spiritually with God s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>From that day we became spiritual, but just partially, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The rest of our entire being still remained untransformed in the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Stanza 2 of Hymns, #750 says: God hath us regenerated / In our spirit with His life; / But He must transform us further / In our soul by His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After regeneration God works to transform our untransformed part, our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Transformation is the cross of Christ crucifying our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This cross is particularly crucifying our untransformed parts.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We all have our particular natural disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I am a quick person, and my quick temperament needs to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When I have to wait for my wife, the quick me is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I have been crucified by Christ practically for about seventy years, but my quick temperament is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Every man s self is his center.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Everyone is self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we are put in a prominent position or are noticed by others in the church life, we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is because we are so self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When others do not give strong amens to our sharing in the meetings, we are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We do not feel that the meetings are so good, because everyone else gets strong amens but us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This illustration shows how much we need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>To be transformed is a metabolic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When the food that we eat is metabolically digested and assimilated by us, we are transformed in a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is an illustration of our spiritual transformation with the life of God as the element.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Metabolism needs some element, and this element is God Himself through Christ in three steps: in Christ s death, in Christ s resurrection, and in Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have the divine life of God, but this life has not been worked into our being to make this life a part of our being.</S>
