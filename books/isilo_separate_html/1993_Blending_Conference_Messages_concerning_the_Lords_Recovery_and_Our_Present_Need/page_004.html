THE LORD'S RECOVERY OF THE TRUTHS<br>BEING OF TWO CATEGORIES</H2><P>The Lord's recovery of the divine truths is of two categories.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Category of the Major Items<br>for the Eternal Economy of God</H2><P>The first category is the category of the major items for God's eternal economy, that is, God's eternal plan, God's eternal purpose, God's divine will. The first of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity. Throughout the centuries much has been spoken and written concerning the Divine Trinity, but most of this speaking and writing is not accurate and does not present a proper definition of the Triune God. However, in the Lord's recovery this has been recovered. This is a major recovery. Additional major items that have been recovered are the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body of Christ, and the ground of the church. All these major items are for the eternal economy of God.</P><P>If you were to tell many Christians the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity, the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body of Christ, and the ground of the church, they would be greatly surprised because they are not familiar with these items. However, in the Lord's recovery, these items have been our "regular meals." We do know the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity, and we also know the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body, and the ground of the church. These are major items of the Lord's recovery. In addition to these seven items, there are a number of other important items related to God's eternal economy that are not mentioned here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Category of the Minor Items<br>for the Practices of the Believers and the Church</H2><P>The second category of the divine truths recovered by the Lord is the category of the minor items for the practices of the believers and the church. The minor items in the Lord's recovery include the proper teaching concerning the Old Testament dispensational diet (Lev. 11), which was adjusted by the apostle Paul in his Epistles (1 Cor. 6:12-13a; 10:25-27); the proper teaching concerning the dispensational keeping of the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8-11) in the Old Testament age, which is over in the New Testament age; head covering (1 Cor. 11:2-15); foot-washing (John 13:3-10); and other items for the personal practices of the believers. The minor items of the Lord's recovery also include baptism by immersion, the presbytery for the administration of the church, the proper way to have the Lord's table, the proper way for the gifted persons to function in the church, the relationship between the elders and the gifted persons, and other items for the official practices of the church. These items for the practices of the believers and the church are minor items and should not be considered major items of the Lord's recovery.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
