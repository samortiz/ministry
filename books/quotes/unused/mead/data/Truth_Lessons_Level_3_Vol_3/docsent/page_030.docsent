   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit; to walk by the Spirit is to let the Holy Spirit regulate our walk from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we live by the Spirit, our daily walk should also be by the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word for walk in verse 16 means to tread all around, to walk at large; hence, to deport oneself, move, and act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word for walk in verse 25 means to march in military rank, to keep in step, and derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first walk is for the second walk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we take the Spirit as the essence of our life, we are able to take the Spirit as the path for our way.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This threefold Spirit has been mingled with our spirit to become a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Translators of the Bible realize the difficulty in determining whether spirit in Romans 8:4 and in other verses in this chapter refers to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we are willing to take the cross, remain in the Lord s death, and be constrained by the Lord s love, the more we will be strengthened by the resurrection life to walk according to the mingled spirit.</S>
