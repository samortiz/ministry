<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN ONE ACCORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE RECEIVING THE BURDEN<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>As Christians, we must preach the gospel. Every Christian has to preach the gospel. The primary reason for there being only a few saints in a local church is nearly always the neglect of preaching the gospel. If very few new believers are brought in after a period of time, it must be because the saints have neglected to preach the gospel. We should pray that the Lord would give us the burden to preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel does not depend on a method; it is a matter of burden. Preaching the gospel involves passing out tracts and contacting people. Even if people do not like the fact that we preach the gospel and do not receive us, we still need to find ways to continue preaching the gospel by passing out tracts and contacting people. As long as we preach the gospel steadfastly, people will eventually get saved.</p>
<p>Few people will get saved if we rely on monthly gospel meetings but do not preach the gospel in our daily life. Hence, we should preach the gospel and contact people in our daily life. There is a brother who had a strong burden for his supervisor, who was an unbeliever and also opposed the Lord. Nevertheless, the first thing this brother did every day at work was to put a gospel tract on his supervisor&rsquo;s desk. When the supervisor saw the gospel tract, he threw it away. But this brother continued to put a gospel tract on his supervisor&rsquo;s desk daily until his supervisor was eventually saved. When we preach the gospel, we need to speak and persistently bother people. Someone may oppose the gospel for many years but eventually be touched and saved.</p>
<p>Everyone, including the younger and the older saints, should receive the burden to preach the gospel. Whenever there is an opportunity, on any day of the week, we should preach the gospel to a few people. As long as the gospel is preached, people will be saved. Therefore, we must preach the gospel even if we do not have a burden. Having a formal monthly gospel meeting is better than doing nothing, but it is also possible to contact people street by street. When we start a new street, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, this land is dry. We commit this land to you. Pour down rain on this land today.&rdquo; By preaching the gospel, we water the land. If we preach the gospel again on the following day, we water the land some more. If we would only be concerned about regularly watering the land, there will certainly be some fruit in the end. In particular, the young brothers and sisters should receive this burden. Whether or not the church has a gospel meeting, they should always bring their classmates and friends to salvation. This is altogether a matter of burden.</p>
<p>For example, the saints in the church in Los Angeles are very burdened to speak about the ground of the church. They do not care whether people agree; the saints only care to speak to people and help them accept the ground of the church. Their speaking has produced a favorable result. We should not expect to do a great or quick work, nor should we expect to gain a large number of people. Instead, we should do a slow work. Our job is to preach the gospel, and people will be saved. Furthermore, if we have the burden to preach the gospel, the people we bring to salvation will likewise have the burden to preach the gospel, because everything brings forth fruit according to its kind.</p>
<p>We need to have a burden to bring our relatives and friends to salvation by any means. After they are saved, we should help them to have the same burden to contact people. If we would gain a few who would also contact their relatives and friends, the gospel will spread. After one year the number gained will grow from two to twenty. In another year the number will grow to forty. If these forty people have the burden for the gospel, the gospel will be prevalent in that locality. This is altogether a matter of the burden. Apparently, it is not easy to preach the gospel, but actually, it is not hard. The more we think that it is hard to preach the gospel, the harder it becomes. Eventually, no one will be willing to receive a burden when the responsible brothers decide to have a gospel meeting. As a result, the speaker will be unable to give a clear message, and few will hear the gospel. Eventually, the saints will be cold toward the gospel. This is a disservice to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FEARING DIFFICULTIES<br />
WHEN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Whether in Tsingtao, Shanghai, or Hong Kong, the saints in those places initially said that it was not easy to preach the gospel. However, when the church in Tsingtao rose up to preach the gospel, more than seven hundred people were baptized. Likewise, the church in Shanghai grew in number, and the number of district meetings increased. The church in Hong Kong had to purchase a piece of land and built a large meeting hall in order to accommodate the increase. Our problems related to the gospel originate from a lack of burden. It is impossible for people not to get saved if we would preach the gospel. We must receive the burden to preach until people believe in Jesus.</p>
<p>It is much easier for us to preach the gospel today than it was for the missionaries who went to China at the end of the Ching Dynasty. It was difficult for the missionaries to go to China to preach the gospel. At that time China was a closed culture. People in the countryside who saw missionaries entering a village would shout that the foreign devils had come. All the doors would be closed, and no one in the entire village would be seen on the street. It was useless for the missionaries to knock on the doors, because no one was willing to open the door. Hunter Corbett was a missionary sent from the United States by the Presbyterian Church. He was a learned and spiritual man who labored in the northeast part of Shangtung province for fifty-five years until he died at the age of eighty-five. He often traveled on a big horse and was able to preach the gospel in the native tongue of the local people. In those days one hundred Chinese coins strung together were called a diao. Mr. Corbett carried many diaos with him. The adults were embarrassed to ask for money, but the children had no problem begging. Mr. Corbett would distribute the coins as if he was bestowing grace. As long as people asked, he would give until the money he had run out. The children received him as their god of wealth, but the adults did not like him. They threw stones and dirt at him. Mr. Corbett, however, did not fear, nor did he shun them. He continued walking slowly. Over time the adults were touched because he never hit back. Gradually, the gospel spread. Missionary Corbett preached the gospel during the Boxer Rebellion. However, because he had a loving heart and showed great kindness toward the people, giving everything he had to them, even the Boxers said, &ldquo;Kill all the foreign devils, except for Missionary Corbett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Corbett and his co-workers first went to the countryside in Shantung province, as soon as they entered a village, all the doors would close. Eventually, Mr. Corbett and his co-workers learned to hide next to a door. When the people inside a house opened the door, Mr. Corbett and his co-workers would stick their staff into the doorway so that the door could not be closed. If the people cursed them, they would smile. If the people hit them, they would not hit back. Eventually, this softened people&rsquo;s hearts. The missionaries knew that the people in northern China ground their wheat; nearly every house had a mill room. It was a tiring task to grind at the mill. Therefore, when the missionaries entered into a house, they would run straight to the mill before they could be kicked out. Initially, the people let the missionaries grind. As their hearts softened, the people would bring water for the missionaries. This was an opportunity for the missionaries to speak. Eventually, the people were opened. Although it was difficult, the missionaries continued to preach in such a way, and eventually the gospel spread.</p>
<p>When the number of believers increased, the missionaries built schools and did not charge tuition. The missionaries even took care of the students&rsquo; food, lodging, and clothing, and gave them allowances to take home. Because the students were taught the words in the Bible, local preachers were raised up. After a little more than ten years, the first group of local evangelists were produced in China. This is how the door of the gospel was opened in China. It was not easy. Today we should have the same burden and spirit.</p>
<p>Hence, we need to pray for the saints so that they would continue steadfastly in the burden for the gospel and would not fear difficulties. The church in Los Angeles had the burden to preach the ground of the church, which is actually harder than preaching the gospel, among the Chinese Christians and also among the American Christians. Eventually, the people knew that there was a group of Christians from China speaking about the ground of the church. In the same principle, if we have a burden for the gospel, we would each bring one person to salvation every year. The most effective way for the students to preach the gospel to their classmates and to gain them is to befriend them. Do not develop friendships blindly; rather, make friends for the gospel. Young students are pure, but when they are in middle school, they are exposed to all kinds of secular ideologies. Our pure gospel is superior to any secular ideology. If we can make friends with our classmates and preach the gospel to them, it will be easy for them to receive the gospel.</p>
<p>This is how the brothers and sisters in the medical school of Cheeloo University in Jinan preached the gospel. The brothers and sisters loved the Lord in a pure way. However, the environment did not allow them to meet, so they held the table meeting at a graveyard. For the table meeting they put the bread and the cup on a stone table, and fifty or sixty of them sat on the ground. These saints gained more than one hundred medical students by preaching to their classmates. Later, in Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in Beijing, the gospel was spread through some sisters who were nurses in the hospital. Many doctors were brought to salvation through these nurses. Preaching the gospel requires skill, but first of all we need to receive a burden and to pray. Then we need to ask the Lord to give us a way to contact people. If we would pray and then go out to preach the gospel, the Lord will do something, and people will believe.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
