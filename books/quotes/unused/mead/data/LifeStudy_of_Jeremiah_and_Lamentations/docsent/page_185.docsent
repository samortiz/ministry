   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LAMENTATIONS MESSAGE FOUR JEREMIAH S DISAPPOINTMENT AND QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GOD S ETERNAL BEING AND HIS THRONE Scripture Reading: Lam 5:18-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this concluding message to the life-study of Lamentations, I would like to give a further word on 5:18-22.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the end of Jeremiah s lamentations, in the last verses of chapter five, we can see a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lamentations 5:18 and 19 say, Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate / Foxes rove in it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>/ You, O Jehovah, remain forever; / Your throne is from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, Jeremiah speaks of the foxes roving in Mount Zion, and then he declares that Jehovah and His throne remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The comparison here is between Jeremiah s disappointment over the fact that foxes were roving in Zion and his realization that Jehovah and His throne remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jeremiah s Disappointment</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Foxes Roving in Mount Zion</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Jeremiah wrote these verses, he was perplexed and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of his background, he knew the writings of Moses, and he knew the covenant which God had made with Abraham and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, in his five lamentations he did not speak much according to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he spoke altogether according to his personal, human feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning of his fourth lamentation, he referred to Israel as pure gold which had become dim.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How the gold has become dim!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ How the most pure gold has changed! v. 1 . Then near the end of his last lamentation, he said that foxes were roving in Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows Jeremiah s disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Zion was the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To God it was the most holy, sanctified place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could foxes come into this holy city and even rove on the peak of Zion, where the temple was built?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This caused Jeremiah to lament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jeremiah s Realization</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jehovah and His Throne Remaining Forever</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Prior to 5:19, Jeremiah was writing according to his personal, human feeling, but in this verse he leaps out of his human feeling into God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After speaking of foxes roving in Mount Zion, he suddenly declares, You, O Jehovah, remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Foxes are not the only thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jehovah, the Lord of the universe, remains to exercise His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jerusalem was overthrown, the temple was burned down, God s people were carried away, but what about our God, Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jehovah remains, and His throne has not been overthrown and never will be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The divine title Jehovah means I am.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the One who was, who is, and who will be forever Rev 4:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jerusalem was finished, the temple was finished, and the land of Israel was finished, but Jehovah will never be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Jeremiah s position and angle were changed from himself to Jehovah, he realized that although everything may be lost, Jehovah remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the foxes may rove in Zion, and tomorrow they may be gone, but Jehovah will never be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that nothing remains and that everything is finished manifests the truth that Jehovah remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything may be lost, but You, O Jehovah, remain forever; / Your throne is from generation to generation, with no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Heaven and earth may end, but He will never end. He is the unique source, and all the generations come out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I appreciate the contrast in these verses, for it shows us what remains and what does not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today certain things may be roving in Catholicism, in Protestantism, in Judaism, and in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not believe that any of these roving things will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, every ism will come to an end, yet Jehovah will remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In dealing with many negative things and evil persons, there is often no need for God to act.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead of doing something, He does what He teaches us to do He waits.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In particular, He waits for the evil ones to die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should realize, therefore, that death is a very useful tool in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where are all the evil ones in history?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where is Hitler?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where is Mussolini?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One by one, all such evil ones have died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Throughout human history, every evil person eventually has been terminated by death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God, who remains forever, has simply waited for death to take them all away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>JEREMIAH S QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>AND JEHOVAH S SILENCE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although Jeremiah realized that God s being is eternal and His throne remains forever, he still had something within him that caused him to end his lamentations with questions and even with challenges.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 5:20-22 he said to Jehovah, Why do You forget us forever / And forsake us for so long a time?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>/ Turn to us, O Jehovah, and we will be turned; / Renew our days as before.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>/ Or have You utterly rejected us?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>/ Are You exceedingly angry with us?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here Jeremiah speaks to Jehovah a challenging word, even a commanding and rebuking word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, Jehovah did not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead of answering Jeremiah or telling him to be quiet, Jehovah remained silent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the end of Lamentations, the time had not yet come for God to answer Jeremiah s questions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All Jeremiah s challenges and questions are answered in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The consummation of this answer will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There he will see everything clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Until then, Jeremiah must wait on Jehovah, just as he said in 3:25: Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Jeremiah must wait until the New Testament age, until the age of the millennial kingdom, and until the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then he will be fully satisfied.</S>
