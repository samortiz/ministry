   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Being Anxious about Eating,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Drinking, and Clothing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 31 says, Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we come to the crucial matter in verses 19 through 34.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Apparently, in this section of the constitution, the Lord is speaking about the dealing of the kingdom people with material riches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, He is dealing with the matter of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After touching our temper, lust, natural being, self, and flesh, He goes on to touch our anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these verses the word anxious is used six times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>25, 27, 28, 31, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may also seem that the Lord is touching our heart, for where our treasure is, there our heart is also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, our heart is related not only to riches, but to many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed with the Father s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although these chapters do not actually use the words life and nature, from the context we can see that apart from the Father s divine life and nature, these chapters are in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one would be able to fulfill the requirements of the kingdom of the heavens without having the Father s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every constitution is based upon a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose you intend to make a constitution for dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Undoubtedly such a constitution would be based upon the dog life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would be unreasonable for this constitution to decree that, every morning, dogs should observe morning watch by flying in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because dogs cannot fly, they could not fulfill such a requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if the constitution told the dogs to keep morning watch by barking, there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, the constitution given by the Lord Jesus on the mount was for the sons of God, and it was based upon the life and nature of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two verses in chapter five indicate this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 9 says, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God, and verse 48 says, You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians do not understand this section of the Word because they have not seen that it is based upon the divine life and divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even many unbelievers have quoted verses from these chapters in their writings, thinking that these chapters are words spoken to all human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, just as the dog life cannot fly, so the human life cannot fulfill the requirements of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a constitution based upon the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no anxiety in the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anxiety is not of the divine life, but of the human life, just as barking is of the dog life, not of the bird life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our human life is a life of anxiety, whereas God s life is a life of enjoyment, rest, comfort, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To God, anxiety is a strange term.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With Him, there is no such thing as anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you think that God has ever been anxious?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Has He ever been afflicted with anxiety?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although God has many desires, He has no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our human life, on the contrary, is virtually composed of anxiety; it is constituted with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Take anxiety away from a human being and the result will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A dead man has no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A figure in a wax museum or a statue in front of a Catholic cathedral has no anxiety, but as long as you are a living person, you cannot escape from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we consider the style of the Lord s speaking in the New Testament, we shall see that it is absolutely different from the speaking of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Apostles, especially Paul, wrote many spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Paul spoke of many divine, spiritual, and heavenly things, his style is nonetheless human.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the same with the writings of Peter and John.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how much the New Testament writers spoke of spiritual and divine things, their style remained human.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the style of the Lord s speaking in the New Testament is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is utterly impossible to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you read Matthew 5, 6, 7, 13, 24, and 25 and John 14 through 17, you will see that the style of the Lord s speaking is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not human or common; it is profound, yet brief, simple, and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the divine speaking with the divine style.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I was young, I read a statement written by a certain great French philosopher who said that if the four Gospels were falsehoods, then the person who wrote them was qualified to be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I agree with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In His speaking in chapter six of Matthew, the Lord apparently is dealing with the matter of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In reality, however, He is touching the matter of anxiety, the basic problem of our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have seen, in 6:1-18 He apparently dealt with the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, but actually He was touching the self and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I came to know this not by reading books, but from my experience in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through my experience I have learned that making a display of righteous deeds is certainly of the self and of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we remain on the cross, we would never make such a display.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same principle, 6:19-34 seemingly touches our wealth, our riches; actually, the Lord s intention here is to touch anxiety, the source of the problem of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The whole world is involved with anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Anxiety is the gear that makes the world move.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is the incentive for all human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there were no anxiety regarding our living, no one would do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, everyone would be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, by touching our anxiety, the Lord touches the gear of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the young people hear this word, they may say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because the Lord Jesus has touched anxiety, the gear of human life, we don t need to study or work hard.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are hungry, we can simply eat some leftovers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In 6:26 the Lord Jesus says, Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father nourishes them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the Lord Jesus were here, I would ask Him, Lord, You liken us to birds.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The birds neither sow nor harvest; they just fly in the air and do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lord, does this mean that we should not do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The birds feed on human labor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Lord Jesus, do You mean that we should take advantage of others?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Should we forget about working and simply be birds in the air, enjoying life and taking advantage of the labor of others?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I would also ask the Lord, Lord, You also liken us to lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lilies don t do anything, but are clothed in more glory than Solomon vv.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Are You saying that we should not do anything, that we should simply enjoy the air, the sunshine, the soil, and the water?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the concept held by many young people who quote these words of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They say, Let s be birds in the air and lilies in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is a difficulty in understanding the Lord s word here.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Again I say, if the Lord were here, I would ask Him, Do You mean that we should just be like birds soaring in the air, taking advantage of the labor of others?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They sow and grow the crops, and we simply come to enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is this legal?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is it fair?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It seems that all birds are thieves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I have only a small yard, but the birds come and take advantage of what I am growing in my yard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Are You saying that we should do the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I ask these questions because I know the psychology of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After spending so many years in school, they may be tired of studying.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As they go from junior high to high school, from high school to college, and from undergraduate school to graduate school, the work becomes more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Instead of studying so hard, many of the young people would rather be like birds flying in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If the young people are honest, they will admit that they have such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Let us now consider the Lord s intention in verses 19 through 34.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Does the Lord intend that the young people finish school, or drop out and be like birds in the air?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is wrong to have anxiety, for anxiety does not belong to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There is no anxiety in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, the Lord does not mean that we should not do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When the Lord brought the children of Israel into the good land, they all had to work on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>That was their duty.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Whether or not the good land produced a rich harvest depended on a number of things: the weather, the sunshine, the proper amount of rain, and the right temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>None of these things was under the control of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Their responsibility was just to labor on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They labored not only for themselves, but also for the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If they did not do the work of farming, it would have been difficult for the birds to live.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>To do their duty was right and necessary, but to have anxiety was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Likewise, we must do our duty today, but do it without being anxious about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The reason you are so reluctant to give to others is your anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Because of anxiety, you love the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you had no anxiety, you would not care for the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Rather, you would let others have them.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is anxiety that causes us trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In God s economy we all must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We are not like the children of Israel, for we cannot literally work on the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Instead, the young people today must study and acquire a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Studying is equal to tilling the ground, and graduating from college is equal to reaping a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Young people, studying is your duty, and you must do it.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This was their duty.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But whether or not they received the harvest depended upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If they were anxious, that would have been an offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>There was no need for them to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>They simply had to do whatever God asked them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>For example, according to Deuteronomy, God required them to set aside one tenth for Himself, another tenth for the Levites, and still another tenth for a different purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>They were not permitted to keep all the produce for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>They were not to have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If they had no anxiety, they could be generous, willing to give to others and put their material things into the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We need to read 6:19-34 in such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Under God s sovereignty, the children of Israel had to labor on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Under God s sovereignty, the young people today must study and finish school.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If we are to have the proper church life, all our young people must finish college.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Failing to finish college is like sowing without having a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The requirement for making a living today is much different from what it was hundreds of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Today the young people must till the ground, sow the seed, and water the crop by studying diligently and graduating from high school and college.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But they must not do this because of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We must differentiate anxiety from duty.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Your duty is to finish your work of farming, that is, to graduate from high school and college.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to live.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>To live on this earth for God, you must finish your education.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But as you are studying and completing your education, you must be different from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The worldly ones study for the sake of their anxiety; you should not study for anxiety, but to fulfill your duty.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>If you do not see this point, this portion of the Word will simply be a legal matter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Boaz, a forefather of David, is an example of one who did his duty without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Boaz was a rich farmer; he was very productive.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>However, this man was not productive for the sake of anxiety, but for the sake of fulfilling his duty.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>When the time came, the Lord told him to give a certain amount away, and he did it.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Certainly Boaz treasured the things in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Through the overcoming of anxiety, he laid up treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>After a number of years, many of our young people will have college degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>I believe that under the Lord s sovereign blessing, many riches will come in. At that time you will need to remember that you have gone to school not for anxiety, but to do your duty.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Therefore, the riches that you bring in should not be used for your anxiety, but for your duty.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Your duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Do not aspire to be a millionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Do not endeavor to have a savings account of a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Rather, learn to give and lay up treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Transfer your treasures from the earth to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>In this way you will not be a millionaire on earth, but a millionaire in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Your duty is to earn your degree and then to make riches.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>But do not seek to become a millionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Instead, be a good giver according to the life and nature of your heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>This is the meaning of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>My burden in this message is to dig out this basic point.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>We all have our duty to do.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>As we are fulfilling our duty, we should not do anything for the sake of our anxiety, because we have a divine life that knows no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>And we have an almighty and all-inclusive heavenly Father who takes care of us in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Today s world is filled with anxiety, but the kingdom people should not be anxious about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>We are not able to add one cubit to our stature by our anxiety v. 27 . Concerning morality, we have the life and nature of our Father within us to enable us to fulfill the highest moral requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Concerning our living, we have the heavenly Father Himself to take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>However, this does not mean that there is no need for us to do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Although we must fulfill our duty, we should have no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>Like the children of Israel who had enough to live on and who gave certain portions away for various purposes, we also should have a harvest and be willing to give a certain amount away for various purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Eventually, all we give will be laid up in the heavenly bank, and all our riches will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>This also is related to our daily growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Both sloppiness and anxiety will delay your growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>No one who is idle, who does not fulfill his duty, will ever grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Everyone who grows in life is diligent and industrious.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Of course, this diligence and industriousness will yield a reward, and some material riches will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>All these riches must be used, not for your anxiety, but for your giving.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>Anxiety must go.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>Do not allow anxiety to occupy your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Because the life of the Father within you knows no anxiety, you should not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>Any surplus you have should not be used for the sake of your anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>Use it to build up savings in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>I assure you that if you do this, you will grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>The only kind of person who grows in life is one who is diligent, yet who does not use his surplus for his anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>You need to study diligently, make good grades, and acquire the highest degree.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>However, the riches that come to you should not be used for your anxiety.</S>
