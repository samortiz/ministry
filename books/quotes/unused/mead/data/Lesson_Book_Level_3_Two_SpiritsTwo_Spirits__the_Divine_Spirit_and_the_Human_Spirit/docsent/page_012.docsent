   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Cassia</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth spice, cassia, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cassia and cinnamon belong to the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Cinnamon is from the inner part of the bark, and cassia, from the outer part of the bark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both cinnamon and cassia are sweet and fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the plants from which they are derived often live and grow in places where other plants cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ancient times cassia was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cassia thus signifies the power, the effectiveness, of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's resurrection can withstand any kind of environment, and His resurrection certainly is a repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It repels all evil "insects" and especially the old serpent, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day by day we must put on the life-giving Spirit as the repellent to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you not only drink of Him; you also put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the first thing in the morning you do not put on this repellent, the snake will attack you, and you may lose your temper during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you call on the Lord's name a few times, you will not only drink of the living water, but also apply the repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever you do this, the snake will be frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND MEASUREMENTS A. One Hin of Oil with Four Spices</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In typology numbers are significant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here in Exodus 30 we have one plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typology the number one signifies the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God, signified by the complete unit of a hin of olive oil, is unique and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number four signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In both Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4 we read of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in the Bible the number four always signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in this compound ointment we have God signified by the number one and God's creatures signified by the number four.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the compound ointment is a matter of God plus His creature, man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This reveals that the ointment is compounded with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God, the basic element, is signified by the olive oil, and man is represented by the four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Three Units of Five Hundred</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the compound Spirit we also have the Triune God: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps you are wondering how it is possible to see the Triune God typified by the compounded ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this ointment the Triune God is typified by the three units of the measure of the four spices Exo 30:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the compounded ointment there were five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels each of cinnamon and calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there were four spices, there was a total of three units of five hundred shekels in measure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But how can we apply this to the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first unit is five hundred shekels of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half: two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third unit is five hundred shekels of cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Notice that it is the second unit, the middle one, that is split into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Surely this points to the Second of the Triune God, the Son, and to His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. Five Elements</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lastly we see the significance of the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ointment is composed of five basic elements: olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The quantity of the spices compounded with the olive oil is one hundred times five.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible the number five, composed of four plus one, is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both the ten commandments and the ten virgins are divided into two groups of five Exo 34:28-29; Matt 25:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Look at your hand: You have four fingers and one thumb for the bearing of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you had four fingers but no thumb, it would be very difficult to pick up things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you the number four or the number five?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God has been added to you, you are number five.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know that I am number five, because God has been added to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The significance of the number five is that the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is for the bearing of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more you enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ, the more ability you will have to bear responsibility.</S>
