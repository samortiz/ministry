	<li>Tossed by waves.</li>
	<li>Carried about by every wind of teaching:

<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You speak to us in Your recovery all the time. You are the life-giving Spirit living in us and moving among us. We again look to You for this meeting. We confess that we can do nothing and that we have nothing. We are poor and are nothing. Lord, apart from You we have nothing and can do nothing. All that we have depends on You. Speak to us in our speaking, and listen for us in our listening. Vindicate to us that we are one spirit with You. Make us understand and grant us the light in our listening. Lord, grant grace to everyone that is here in the meeting, and may everyone receive something from You. May none have come in vain. May everyone receive something and be fed. Lord, You are the all-inclusive Christ. You can meet all of our various needs. You can meet many needs by one kind of word. Since You could feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes, You can supply all of us tonight with the few words we speak. Lord, give us the timely word, the pure word, the word that would crush Your enemy and destroy his power. Remove the darkness, the shadows, the veils, and open our eyes and shine on us. Lord, make those who have loved You for many years love You more. May our love to You never grow old, but may it be renewed day by day.</p>
<p>Lord, show us the real things. The world is vanity; everything will pass away. But those who practice the will of God, who have a part in the building up of the Body of Christ, will abide forever. We worship You that in these last days You have enlightened this revelation among us. We pray that there would be an intensified enlightening tonight so that all of us would receive light and enter into Your reality to have a part in the building up of the Body. Lord, answer our prayer, and pour down Your blessing. For Your own recovery&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of the bride that You are after, be merciful to us. Again, in Your name and upon the position that You have given us, we command You to defeat Your enemy and to build up Your Body that Your recovery may be like the dawning of the day in the coming years and may shine brighter and brighter until the day be fully come. Lord, tonight is the time for You to shine Your light. Open up the sky, and reveal Your heart&rsquo;s desire to every one of us. May we feel Your presence in the depth of our being. Thank You and praise You. You are Emmanuel, the Lord that grants grace to us. May You gain the glory, may we receive the blessing, and may the enemy be defeated and be shamed. Amen!</p>
<p>Tonight we will emphasize Ephesians 4:11-16. These six verses can be divided into two sections. The first three verses are of one section, and the last three are of the other section. The first section speaks of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts given by the ascended Head. The second section speaks of the direct building up of the Body of Christ by the perfected saints.</p>
