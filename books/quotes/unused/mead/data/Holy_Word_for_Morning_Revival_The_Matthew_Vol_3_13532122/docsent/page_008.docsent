   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the end of chapter thirteen to the middle of chapter seventeen we have a clear map showing us how to walk on the pathway as we follow our beloved King into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first thing we face on this pathway is rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not expect to be welcomed, for no one will welcome you until the glory comes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heavenly King was rejected to the uttermost first by the Jewish religious leaders because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the Galileans thinking they knew everything about Him rejected Him because they were blinded by their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They knew Him according to the flesh not according to the spirit 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and knowledge are both veils, even two great obstacles, frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh but according to the measure of Christ, not caring for the outward appearance but only for the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 14 we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Politics is always alongside religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the basic principle of vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's miraculous feeding of the crowds in the wilderness portrays our situation after we have experienced and passed through rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will be in want and have certain needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Lord has a way to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply offer what we are and what we have into His hand, let Him break the offering, and let the broken offering feed the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this, we will enjoy satisfaction, and there will be a surplus remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The storm in chapter fourteen indicates that on the pathway where we follow the rejected King there will always be troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not be troubled by any storms, for we are in the boat, the Lord's church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether the Lord is on the mountain interceding or on the waves walking toward us, we should not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the Lord's word we may walk to meet Him, even walking through all the opposition and upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was a miracle that Peter could walk on the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He walked on the waves by faith.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Jewish religionists accused the Lord's disciples of transgressing their tradition 15:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition v. 3 . In this way He brought them back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who follow the traditions may claim to know the Bible, but actually they are completely blind and have no light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Pharisees cared only for the outward tradition, ritual, and practice, for example, the washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed them to the inward matter of the heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>8, 18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Lord's recovery we treasure the pure Word and the inward experience of Christ, the inward reality.</S>
