        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY OF ENJOYING GOD<br />
REQUIRING A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</h1>
<p>If we want to take the way of enjoying God, we must have a change of concept. Everything that a person does is according to his concept. A person&rsquo;s concept determines how he does something. Likewise, the way we handle spiritual matters depends on our spiritual seeing. This principle also applies to our enjoyment of God. If we want to enter into the reality of the enjoyment of God, we must see a controlling vision.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I experienced a dynamic salvation when I was young. This was over thirty years ago. Afterward, the Lord&rsquo;s grace to me was so rich that I was willing to pursue Him at any cost. For this reason I spent much time praying and reading the Bible. I spent more time to read the Bible than to do anything else. I was devoted to studying the Bible. However, even though I exerted much effort to read the Bible and pray, I did not receive much benefit.</p>
<p>It was not until I was forty years of age that the Lord revealed to me the way of enjoying Him. I was disappointed that for twenty years most of my time and energy had been wasted. Most of my prayers were of no value, and the time that I had spent reading the Bible and other spiritual books was also of no value. This is when I realized that our way of working was wrong and that our way of spiritual pursuit was also wrong.</p>
<p>Because I suffered a great loss from taking the wrong way, I do not want others to repeat the same mistake. I hope that others can take the way of enjoying God. I implore the saints to no longer take the wrong way. We should consider our former way of pursuit. We must have a drastic change of concept. We need to have a controlling vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD WHOM CHRISTIANS WORSHIP<br />
DIFFERING FROM THE GOD WHOM MUSLIMS WORSHIP</h2>
<p>The relationship between man and God that is presented in the Bible is different from the worship rendered to God in Islam. The sincerity of Muslims can put Christians to shame, because Muslims are more pious than most Christians when they worship God. However, the worship of Muslims is derived from a natural concept. They worship God, but they do not know what it means to enjoy God. They worship a God who is outside of them; they do not understand that God can enter into them and have a life relationship with them.</p>
<p>It is a pity that many Christians do not know that we worship a God who has entered into us and has a life relationship with us. Some may understand this as a doctrine, but in their experience many Christians worship a God who is outside of them. They have the sentiment that their worship, prayer, and service are toward a God who is outside of them.</p>
<p>There are verses in the Bible that tell us to worship the God who is in heaven and to come into His presence and make our requests known to Him (Exo. 20:1-5; Phil. 4:6). However, the Bible also says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit&rdquo; (1 John 4:13), and &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5). These verses speak of God&rsquo;s desire to enter into man and have a life relationship with man. The Bible contains many such portions.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that worshipping God is a matter of abiding in Him. Unless we worship God by abiding in Him, our worship is of no value in God&rsquo;s eyes, because He has said, &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; The phrase <em>apart from Me</em> may also be rendered as &ldquo;outside of Me.&rdquo; Hence, worship to a God who is in heaven is not considered by God as worship. John 15:7 says, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo; This shows that even when we pray to the Lord, we need to abide in Him. Only the prayers that we utter when abiding in the Lord are valuable to Him.</p>
<p>Bible students acknowledge that the word <em>in</em> is used many times in the New Testament. For example, John 15:4 says, &ldquo;Abide <em>in</em> Me and I <em>in</em> you,&rdquo; and 1 John 3:24 says, &ldquo;He who keeps His commandments abides <em>in</em> Him, and He <em>in</em> him.&rdquo; There are many such instances in the New Testament. Regrettably, this thought is not in our natural concept; hence, many people do not notice this word when they read the Bible. When people read the book of Ephesians, they are not impressed with the phrases <em>in Christ</em> and <em>in the Lord.</em> But they are impressed with the verses concerning husbands loving their wives and wives being subject to their husbands (5:22-33), and with the verses concerning children obeying their parents and parents not provoking their children to anger (6:1-4), and with the verses concerning slaves serving their masters faithfully and masters treating their slaves properly (vv. 5-9). Ephesians is a short book with six chapters, but the phrases <em>in Christ</em> (1:3, 10, 12; 4:32), <em>in Christ Jesus</em> (1:1; 2:6, 7, 10, 13; 3:6, 11, 21), <em>in Him</em> and <em>in whom</em> (1:4, 7, 10, 11, 13; 2:21, 22; 3:12; 4:21, 30), and <em>in the Lord</em> (2:21; 4:1, 17; 5:8; 6:1, 10, 21) are used many times. According to the Bible, loving one&rsquo;s wife, being subject to one&rsquo;s husband, honoring one&rsquo;s parents, teaching and caring for one&rsquo;s children, serving one&rsquo;s master faithfully, and treating one&rsquo;s slaves properly need to be done in the Lord (5:20-25; 6:1-9). It is a pity that most people do not have this realization. The problem is that God&rsquo;s children have not had a change in concept. Having a change in concept depends on seeing a vision.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
