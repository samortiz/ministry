   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOCKETS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 19 says, And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These sockets signify stability for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were made of silver, signifying the redemption of Christ as the base for the believers standing for God s dwelling place 30:12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were two sockets under each board for its tenons, which made forty on the north side and forty on the south side, signifying being tested and tried for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Altogether there were ninety-six silver sockets for the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This number, composed of twelve times eight, signifies the completion of the divine administration in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as we are not told the size and shape of the tenons, neither are we told the size and shape of the sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 38:27, each socket was a talent of silver, weighing approximately one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we do not know if the sockets were round, square, or rectangular.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I prefer to believe that they were square in order to bear the weight of the building with its four layers of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this point we need to ask what the two tenons on each board signify.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These tenons were not merely connected to the sockets, but they fit into the sockets and actually became one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sockets were solid and weighty and had holes to contain the tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the sockets were made of silver signifying redemption, I believe that the two tenons refer to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Exodus 30 the children of Israel were commanded to pay a half shekel each for redemption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This silver was used to make the sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we have pointed out, there were ninety-six sockets for the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later we shall see that there were four additional sockets of silver used to support the pillars which held up the veil separating the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, there were one hundred sockets of silver, each one weighing about one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the base of the tabernacle consisted of ten thousand pounds of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In typology, silver signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the sockets of silver typify the solid redemption of Christ as the base of our standing in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not stand on sinking sand we stand on Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has redeemed us, and now His redemption is our solid standing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s redemption is a socket in which the two tenons are placed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that the two tenons on each board signify our faith in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our standing is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Corinthians 1:24 Paul says, In faith you stand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 5:2 and Galatians 5:1 Paul speaks of standing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 5:2 says, Through whom also we have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Galatians 5:1 says, For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tenons signify our faith by which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we must go on to ask why there are two tenons on each board.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the tenons signify our faith, why are there two instead of just one?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The answer is that these two tenons signify a complete faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A simple illustration will help us in our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a pair of eyeglasses there are two lenses, one for each eye.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But these two lenses make up one pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we have two eyes, we have one field of vision.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would certainly be a serious problem if we had double vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a pair of glasses is properly prescribed, we have one clear field of vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the two lenses make one pair of glasses, so the two tenons are one complete faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen that the number two signifies confirmation, testimony, and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Genuine faith always includes these three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our faith in the Lord Jesus is genuine, it will have a testimony, confirmation, and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Otherwise, our faith is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A proper faith is one that is testified and confirmed and that has a proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Just as it takes two half-steps, one with each foot, to make a complete step, so we need two tenons in order to have a complete faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have known some Christians whose faith was incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They had what we may call a one-tenon faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, they believed, but on the other hand, they doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They seemed to say both yes and no at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to have a board with one tenon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the standing boards had only one tenon, the boards could easily be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be shaken is to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is to question whether it is right to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those with this kind of faith, a faith of one tenon, cannot stand firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Both for standing and for walking we need two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our faith must have two tenons placed firmly in the silver sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must have a complete faith in the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we shall have the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I was in organized Christianity, I saw many so-called believers who did not have a proper faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some seemed to be standing not even on one foot but on one toe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They claimed to be Christians, yet they did not believe many things that are in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We, however, believe whatever the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, our faith has two feet, two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To have complete faith means to believe everything in the Bible without a trace of doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Perhaps you feel that because you sometimes have doubts, you do not have true faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the past I also had doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, if you consider your situation, you will see that what you doubted was your experience, not the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is common for believers to have doubts about their Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some may question if they have really been forgiven or regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Others may doubt that they love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There was a time when I had doubts about my love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One day I knelt down and told Him that I asked heaven and earth to witness that I loved Him with all my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I went on to say, Lord, You have heard my word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From now on I shall never doubt that I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Nevertheless, as soon as I finished my prayer, I began to doubt once again.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I did not doubt the Word of God; I doubted my experience of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the past I also had doubts about the way of the church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When I decided to take this way, I had the assurance that it was right.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I had determined that to be a proper human being I must be a Christian, and that to be a Christian I must take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Otherwise, it seemed to me that it was meaningless to live.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes I praised the Lord for showing me the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I thanked Him not only that I was a Christian, but also that I was one taking the church way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, when other Christians refused to greet me because I had turned from the denominations to the church, I began to doubt whether or not I was actually taking the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I asked myself, If the church is right, why don t other Christians greet me?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What I doubted was not the Bible it was my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Because we have genuine faith, we do not doubt the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For example, we do not doubt that God created the heavens, the earth, and us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our faith is of two tenons, and we are standing steadfast in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Praise the Lord that we are standing in two hundred pounds of silver!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We do not simply stand upon the redemption of Christ; we stand in it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our faith is firmly set in the silver sockets of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We in the local churches have a firm and stable standing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We all are standing in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The reason the churches in the Lord s recovery are so strong is that we all have a firm standing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many Christians in other groups, however, can easily be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They do not have a firm standing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Our firm standing is demonstrated when it is necessary for us to have a funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Friends and observers who have attended our funerals have sometimes been surprised that there is not much weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>At most funerals there is weeping without restraint or control.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In our funerals, on the contrary, we do not weep very much, because we have a firm standing.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We believe in God and we believe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This gives us a firm, unshakable standing.</S>
