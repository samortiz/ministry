   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entire Bible reveals God being life to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament, His chosen people were Israel, but in the New Testament, His chosen people are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As believers, we were chosen to be holy that we may have His nature, and we were predestinated to be His sons that we may have His life Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's intention is to impart Himself into us as our life and as our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After imparting Himself into us, He begins to dispense Himself into our being in a very fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for us to experience the dispensing of the Triune God as life into our being, we need to be those who are living with Christ as Immanuel.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Triune God's Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we get into the depths of the Bible, we can see that in order for the Triune God to be life to the tripartite man, He needed to pass through two main processes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first was incarnation, and the second was resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these two processes, He became two things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through incarnation He became a man John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Incarnation was the bringing forth of Immanuel Matt 1:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the first process our Triune God passed through in order to become life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through incarnation He branched Himself out, in His divinity, into humanity as the Shoot of Jehovah Isa 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became a God-man with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unbelieving Jews have God, but the God they have is merely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The God the Christians have is not only divine but also human.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus was the name given by God, and Immanuel, which means God with us, was the name called by man v. 23 . His name was Jesus, but those who experienced Him called His name Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now Jesus, our Immanuel, is the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
