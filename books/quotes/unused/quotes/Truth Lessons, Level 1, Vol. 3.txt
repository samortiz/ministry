We will use twenty-four lessons to focus on the initial stage of God's full salvation, the stage of regeneration
In this first lesson we will see the condition of man after Adam's fall and before man receives God's salvation
After the fall and before receiving salvation mans condition before God in himself and under Satans hand is exceedingly pitiful and tragic
Although men have been condemned already under God's judgment, they still must suffer judgment again after death
God already has condemned men according to His righteousness; yet because of His love, He has not carried out His condemnation
Because man is brought forth in iniquity and is constituted of sin, the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth
The works of the flesh such as fornication uncleanness and sensuality as listed in Galatians 51921 clearly issue from within the flesh
Because nothing good dwells in man's flesh, the good that man wills, he does not do; but the evil that he does not will, this he practices
Because men are enemies of God, naturally they are not subject to the law of God, nor are they acceptable to God
Men can do many shameful things without feeling disgraceful, and they can do many hateful things without feeling sorrowful
They desire to be free, yet they cannot be free; they struggle and endeavor, yet they cannot break away from the tyranny and slavery of sin
They do not like to commit sin or do evil, yet they cannot help it, and they desire to rid themselves of sin, yet they cannot do it
Men are at enmity with God, have become sons of disobedience, and disapprove of holding God in their knowledge
People live in the world today without hope , without aim, without a destination, and not knowing the meaning of their life
Since men are related to the Devil in life and united with him in nature, they are therefore children of the Devil
After the fall men became children of the Devil and were subjected under his authority obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air
All the things that men do to oppose God and all the evil things that men do are the result of Satan's operation in men's hearts
Although they understand philosophy and science, they neither comprehend the things of God nor know the salvation of Christ
When their hearts adore such persons, matters, or objects, and their eyes esteem them, their minds are veiled and blinded by Satan
They are in a realm where there is neither light nor righteousness, but rather one that is full of darkness and unrighteousness
Since men have joined Satan in sinning against God, they deserve to suffer the penalty of eternal fire with him
Because people have been following Satan to sin for their whole life, they should accompany Satan to suffer punishment for eternity
Eventually men will enter into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil, which is the lake of fire, to suffer torment for eternity
According to His desire, His good pleasure, He foreknew a group of people that He might work in them to carry out His economy
After their birth, as far as their conduct was concerned, Jacob was worse than Esau, yet God's selection did not change
The fact that God chose us because of His mercy, not because of our works, indicates that God's selection was by His grace
We will be holy and without blemish, not according to our standard or in our eyes, but according to His standard and in His eyes
Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
God not only chose us before the foundation of the world, but also predestinated us before the ages unto glory
God has put us into Him to conform us to His image to be His many brothers, that He should be the Firstborn among us
God predestinated us not only that we should be conformed to the image of His Son, but that we should also receive sonship
At the time of the Lord's return our physical body will also be saturated with the sonship and be transfigured
We have the Spirit of the Son and the life of the Son in us, sanctifying us, transforming us, and conforming us to the image of God's Son
We have the position of the Son that we may have the legal right to inherit all that God the Father is and all that He has
According to His foreknowledge and His good pleasure, He chose us in eternity past that we should be holy and without blemish before Him
According to the good pleasure of His will and according to His purpose, He predestinated us before the ages that we should obtain glory
Eventually our whole being with its three partsspirit soul and bodywill look exactly like Christ and be fully saturated with Gods glory
Because of the fall of man, all of God's original creation became old and is no longer able to fulfill God's purpose
God needs a new creation, a creation with a life that is stronger and much better than the created life of Adam
The transfer of life in God's calling is from the fallen life of the old creation to this stronger and better life of the new creation
He also gave them this glory that they might have God's life and nature and become one to be God's corporate expression
After His death and resurrection, He entered into the disciples with His glory so that they might share His glory
Eventually, when Christ comes again, this glory will be expressed through the believers' whole being-their spirit, soul, and body
Virtue, literally meaning excellency, denotes the energy of life to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes
Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God , has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us
God's calling is also through the gospel preached by God's sent ones so that God's called ones may hear and receive Christ
God has called the believers that He may separate them from all the common things and sanctify them unto Himself for His own purpose
He will glorify us , immersing us in His glory that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom , the kingdom into which He has called us
He will enable us to inherit the inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for us
We need to have seven things as the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God
The fact that mankind is in darkness proves that mankind is under the authority of Satan and dead in offenses and sins
When God comes to call man, He opens man's eyes and turns man from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to Himself
God has called us that He may deliver us out of the death-realm of Satan's darkness into the life-realm of God's marvelous light
God's calling is that His chosen ones may be separated and made holy unto God, to be the holy ones, the saints
The saints are produced through the calling of the sanctifying God, who called them out of the world unto Himself
We were called by God into the fellowship of such an all-inclusive Christ that we may enjoy Him as our God-given eternal portion
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps'
He bore our griefs and carried our sorrows; He was wounded for our transgressions and was bruised for our iniquities
The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing that He may be reproduced in us
Colossians 3:15 says, 'And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body'
In the new man there is no Greek, Jew, circumcision, or uncircumcision, and there are no different races, classes, or nationalities
After man sinned and fell, God's original purpose in creating man was lost; man could no longer contain or express God
The glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is that Christ is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father's life and nature to express Him
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness
God has called the believers not only unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, but also into the eternal glory of God
Today we, the called ones, must live in the church that we may grow and develop in the life of God unto full maturity
Immediately after God's calling, the Holy Spirit came to separate man, to sanctify man, so that man would repent and turn to God
The divine title the Holy Spirit indicates God reaching man to separate man unto Himself for His purpose and to make man holy as He is holy
In John 168 the Lord said of the Spirit that He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
The Spirit convicts man, first, concerning sin; second, concerning righteousness; and third, concerning judgment
Righteousness is related to Christ because righteousness comes from Christ and even is the resurrected Christ Himself
If a sinner does not believe in the Lord Jesus, he is not only rejecting God's grace but also resisting His command
Since man is sinful and has been condemned already, all that God can ask man to do now is to believe in the Lord Jesus
If a man does not believe in the Lord Jesus today, he violates God's unique command and commits the unique sin
God raised Him from among the dead that we might be justified, and that He might be the proof of our justification
Any man who does not repent and believe into Christ will remain in sins to share with Satan the judgment that he will suffer for eternity
Since Satan has been judged on the cross of Christ, he no longer has dominion over those who believe in Christ
If anyone would still remain under Satan's hand and be an enemy of God, he will share in God's judgment upon Satan
If a man believes in Christ he will be delivered from his sin obtain Gods righteousness and be spared of the judgment that Satan will suffer
It is not to improve or reform oneself nor to forsake the evil and turn to the good, as people generally believe
Since the fall of man, man's mind has been turned against God and directed toward many persons, things, and matters other than God
Originally mans mind was toward all things outside of God hence under its direction all of mans behavior and actions were also against God
Just as man's committing sins and doing evil are contrary to God, so also are his doing good and practicing justice
If a mans repentance does not issue in his turning to God it is a repentance that the world approves but not the repentance that God desires
When men repent and turn toward God so that their sins are forgiven, they receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and the divine inheritance
The divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do for His redeemed people
He rules sovereignly, arranging all of man's environment and the condition of his heart, to lead man to repent and turn to God
Based on His redemption, He gives the grace of forgiveness of sins to the repenting ones that they may obtain salvation
God overlooked the times of men's ignorance, but now in the New Testament age He charges all men everywhere to repent and turn to Him
The Lord Jesus, continuing His forerunner's teaching, also preached repentance and brought salvation to the repenting ones
Repentance is also a divine requirement of God's New Testament economy, for He has charged all man everywhere to repent unto Him
In the previous lesson we saw that the repentance spoken of by the world differs in meaning from the repentance taught in the Bible
Even if one acknowledges the gospel and the redemption of Christ, one still cannot be counted as having believed
By believing in Him by receiving Him we can receive this One who is the Word the very God and the light into us to be joined to us as one
One who genuinely believes in the Lord Jesus is one who has entered into Him and has been joined to Him through faith
To believe into the Lords name is to believe into the living Person of the Lord to believe into the Lord Himself to be joined to Him as one
Having passed through death and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit who, like the air, fills all things and is omnipresent
He put on the likeness of men becoming the Son of Man that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death that is the Devil
He applied this type to Himself showing that when He became flesh, He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin
The Bible says clearly that a man is not and cannot be justified before God by works; he is and can only be justified by faith
Unless a man believes, he still has no share in the redemption accomplished by Christ and cannot be justified through His redemption
Man must believe that he may be joined to the Lord and be brought into Him and that he may receive Him and what He has accomplished for man
When a person believes in the Lord, he can be reconciled to God and also accepted by God through all that the Lord Jesus has accomplished
Based on what is revealed in the Bible, man is regenerated, that is, he is begotten of God, at the moment he believes
After believing, he does not receive anything additional, but rather experiences continually what he has already received
The Bible does not ask us to believe in the death of the Lord Jesus; it only tells us to believe in His resurrection
His death is acknowledged by all men, but no one can believe in His resurrection unless the Holy Spirit reveals it to him
When man believes with the heart that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, the result is righteousness
We also have a mouth with which we can call upon the Lord Jesus so that we may receive Him and gain His salvation and His riches
When Christ is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, spontaneously we appreciate Him and call upon Him
That is, by showing us the divine scenery, He causes the knowledge and appreciation of Christ to be generated in us
It is by the operation of the Holy Spirit that God causes us to believe in Christ through the revelation of the Bible
The Holy Spirit causes us to see the divine scenery through the divine revelation, thus bringing Christ into us
It is when we look unto Jesus that He, as the pneumatic Christ , transfuses us with Himself as the believing element
Such a faith allotted to the believers is the real inheritance and precious portion given to them by God in the New Testament
In contrast, the law, which was given by God outside of Israel through the angels and Moses , was the key to the Old Testament dispensation
They may enjoy the riches of the divine nature in its development to the fullest extent by the virtue of God unto His glory
They may enjoy the riches of the divine nature in its development to the fullest extent by the virtue of God unto His glory
The Lord's salvation has many aspects, some of which we need to receive by believing, while others we need to partake of by being baptized
We must believe and be baptized that we may partake of all the aspects of the Lord's salvation and receive the complete salvation
The first thing God did in the beginning of the New Testament dispensation was to send John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance
Since it was fitting even for the Lord as a man to be baptized to fulfill such righteousness before God, we can see how important baptism is
Merely preaching the gospel to people without baptizing them is insufficient; it cannot completely carry out the Lord's ultimate commission
On the day of Pentecost, many heard Peter's word and were pierced in the heart, and they asked him what they should do
As the conclusion of repentance and believing, baptism causes us to have our sins forgiven and to receive the Holy Spirit
Baptism was practiced by the first group of believers who were added to the church after the Lord's ascension and the Spirit's descension
Based on this principle, the baptism of that first group of people was also a standard that should be kept by those after them
In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus said, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
The name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit is not an empty name but the person the reality of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
In the book of Acts, however, when the apostles went out to practice this, they baptized the believers into the name of the Lord Jesus
Apparently, water is the sphere and element of our baptism; in reality, water signifies a person, an all-inclusive person- Jesus Christ
To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for
On the positive side, Christ's divine life was released and imparted into us that we might become the many grains
In His burial we and our past were terminated, and in His resurrection we have received His life and have a new beginning in life
By faith we walk out of the water, and in resurrection we allow the resurrected Christ to live in us that we may live by Him and with Him
All the believers in Christ, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body
Baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect is the baptism in water; the invisible aspect, the baptism in the Holy Spirit
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water and the Holy Spirit in which we were baptized are typified by the sea and the cloud in which the children of Israel were baptized
Their crossing of the Red Sea in the cloud and in the sea signifies that our baptism should be in the Holy Spirit and in water
Once the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they were delivered out of Egypt and could no longer go back to live the Egyptian life
Baptism delivers us from Satan and the world, just as the crossing of the Red Sea delivered the children of Israel from Pharaoh and Egypt
In Noah's age, it was by the ark that God saved Noah and his family from His judgment, that is, the destruction of the world by the flood
It was by the water as a separating power that God saved them from the corrupted generation and brought them into a new age
On the one hand, they entered the ark by faith and were saved through the ark, thus escaping God's judgment by the flood
On the one hand, we have entered into Christ by faith and have been saved through Christ, thus escaping the judgment of God's wrath
We need not only to believe in all that Christ has accomplished, but also to be baptized to match our believing
Some aspects of God's salvation we need to receive by believing, while others we need to partake of by being baptized
Baptism together with repentance and faith in the Lords name is a condition for us to be forgiven of our sins and to receive the Holy Spirit
Baptism does not merely signify our co-death, co-burial, and co-resurrection with the Lord, as many Christians believe
Through baptism we are actually put into Christ; we are in reality put into His death and are buried and raised together with Him
Many people often change the Lords word He who believes and is baptized shall be saved into He who believes and is saved shall be baptized
What the Lord means is that baptism and faith together are the procedure for salvation and both precede salvation
Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is qualified to be baptized, because the Word says, 'He who believes and is baptized
When Philip preached the gospel to the eunuch from Ethiopia, he also said to him, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may '
It is not necessary to wait until he understands a great number of doctrines, nor is it necessary to require of him other things
Although there were some apostles among the disciples, they did not baptize by their apostleship; rather, they baptized as disciples
The Bible does not tell us that he had any official position in the church; it only says that he was a disciple
The Lord intended that all His disciples who believed in Him would go to preach the gospel to people and baptize them
Philip was not an apostle but an evangelist , yet he not only preached the gospel to the eunuch but also baptized him
Of course, in principle this is true, but in specific cases one must have the leading of the Holy Spirit to do this, as Philip did
Some, however, have taken 1 Corinthians 1:17 as their ground to merely preach the gospel without baptizing people
Although the apostle said that he was not sent to baptize but to preach the gospel, he also baptized if necessary
The Philippian jailer and his household believed in the Lord at night and were baptized immediately the same night
They were Gentiles who had never known God or the word of the Lord, and when they believed it was already midnight
Today if someone is baptized after having believed for only three days, people may blame him for doing it too soon
Concerning baptism, we must be recovered to the extent that the water of baptism always follows the preaching of the gospel
To practice this way is according to the Lord's mind; it is to follow the Bible's example, and it is spiritually profitable
After the eunuch from Ethiopia believed the gospel, Philip baptized him along the road when they came to some water
John 3:23 also says, 'And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized'
These verses tell us that there were about twelve disciples in Ephesus who were baptized with John's baptism of repentance
Of course, in making the correction, we also must exercise our faith to receive all the spiritual realities of baptism
Through baptism we are forgiven of our sins and receive the Holy Spirit, we are put into Christ, and we are saved
Concerning the time of baptism, once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not hesitate a minute
Concerning the place of baptism, there is no restriction except that there should be enough water for a person to be immersed
In the initial stage of God's full salvation, after we have believed and been baptized, we are joined to the processed Triune God
Based on Matthew 28:19, we who have believed and have been baptized can boldly testify that we have been joined to the processed Triune God
1 Corinthians 6:19 reveals that the Holy Spirit also came from God, indicating that God the Father is also His source
To be joined to God, man must first turn to Him from persons, affairs, and things other than God as well as from the authority of Satan
To be joined to God the Father man must not only turn to Him through repentance but also be put into Him through baptism
To baptize people into God the Father is to bring people into a spiritual, mysterious, and organic union with Him
We, therefore, who have turned to Him through repentance and have been baptized into Him have been joined to God the Father
Because we have been born of God the Father, we have the divine life and nature and have been united with God the Father in life and nature
When we turn to Him through repentance, are baptized into Him, and are born of Him, we are joined to God the Father
Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way
After His death and resurrection, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells even the more in His glorified body unto eternity
When the believers are joined to God the Son, Christ, they are joined to the embodiment of the processed Triune God
When we heard the gospel, not only did we hear some preaching or teaching, but even more we received a divine illumination
When God shines Christ into our heart, He brings Christ into us that we may believe and receive Him as our life and everything
God's revealing of His Son to us, the believers, is in us, not outwardly but inwardly; not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing
By both faith and baptism the believers have been brought into Christ and immersed into Him, having thus been deeply joined to Him
Since the believers are persons who are in Christ, they have been identified with Him in His all-inclusive death
God made the believers alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself , into their dead spirit through His Spirit of life
His resurrection was the germination of the new creation, that we who have believed in Him might become the sons of God
We were not only raised together with Christ but also seated together with Him in the heavenlies , in the highest place in the universe
We have been identified with Christ in His death, His burial, His being made alive, His resurrection, and His ascension
In Romans 11:17-24 Paul speaks about God having grafted us as branches from a wild olive tree into Christ as the cultivated olive tree
God attaches the believers corporately unto Christ, the anointed One, to share together the anointing of Christ which He has received of God
Now this pneumatic Christ has entered into the believers and is mingled with their regenerated spirit to become one spirit
Having received Him essentially and having been baptized into Him economically, the believers are organically joined to God the Spirit
Having heard the gospel and having believed in the crucified Christ, the believers have received this all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
It is pointed out here that the Spirit will come to indwell the believers, be joined to them, and be with them forever
When this Spirit enters into the believers, the Triune God is realized in them and mingled with them to become their life and their essence
It is through Him that these divine things may be realized in the believers to be their experience and enjoyment
The more this anointing ointment anoints them, the more the divine elements increase in them and the more the Triune God is united with them
The Spirit's adding the divine elements into them by anointing them is like someone's painting a piece of furniture
He has become the Spirit to be the anointing ointment continually anointing them until they are filled with His elements
Today the Spirit, who is typified by the holy anointing ointment, is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit
The Spirit as the seal comes into the believers once for all, but the sealing of the Spirit is a continuing process
The Greek word for pledge also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance
The Spirit is also the firstfruit in the believers that they may have a foretaste of all that the processed Triune God is
Foretaste indicates two things: first, that the enjoyment is fresh; and second, that there will be a fuller enjoyment in the future
By having a foretaste of the Spirit as the firstfruit, the believers can participate in and enjoy the processed Triune God
The Holy Spirit is not only in them as the Spirit of life essentially, but also upon them as the Spirit of power economically
The Holy Spirit's being poured out upon the believers, His falling upon them, is to clothe them , to be joined to them
We must not stress the Holy Spirit's inward aspect of life while neglecting the Holy Spirit's outward aspect of power
The believers are joined to God the Spirit by receiving Him essentially and being baptized into Him economically
Forgiveness of sins is the first part of God's redemption, and it is received by us immediately upon our believing
When the high priest made atonement for the children of Israel, he took two goats and presented them before God
Having been deceived by Satan, man allowed sin to come upon him, resulting in a charge being brought against him before God
God alone has the position and authority to forgive, because He alone has the position and authority to condemn
Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins
Besides His blood, nothing else-neither man's good works and virtues nor man's zeal and love-can be the basis for the forgiveness of sins
Now, if he desires God's forgiveness, he must turn back to God, forsaking his own way and abandoning his own thoughts, thus turning to God
No matter how broad or how great the limits of our sins are, the limits of God's forgiveness are just as broad and great
Based upon His redemption and through man's repentance and believing, He can give man the forgiveness of sins as a gift
Based upon it, the blessing of God's full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit
Because men have sinned and violated God's righteousness, they are under God's wrath and have become children of wrath
Man's entire life is under the shadow of death; he is constantly threatened, controlled, and enslaved by death, having no freedom whatsoever
Forgiveness of sins is the first part of God's redemption, and it is received by us immediately upon our believing
Forgiveness is a gift given by the exalted Christ and a main item of the believers' proclamation of God's New Testament economy
