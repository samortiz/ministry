   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The manifestation of God's righteousness is mentioned twice in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 1:17 says that the righteousness of God is revealed out of faith to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then Romans 3:21 says that the righteousness of God has been manifested without the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested through faith of Jesus Christ Rom 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By forgiving us God shows forth His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He makes a declaration to the whole universe that because He is righteous, He must forgive us for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, God is legally obligated to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether He is happy with us or not, He must forgive us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God knows that whenever a person points to the resurrected and ascended Christ as a "receipt" for sin, God must forgive that one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this matter the righteous God has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may be fervent for the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At such a time you need to praise God for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our experience may fluctuate, but God remains righteous forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God's righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God's righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God's throne Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has shown forth His righteousness by forgiving us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way God has proved that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now such righteousness of God is our solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that both love and grace may change, but righteousness is solid and steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is free either to love us or not to love us; however, He is bound by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because Christ died to fulfill God's righteous requirements, God has put Himself into a position where He is legally bound to forgive everyone who believes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is bound by His own righteousness to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the righteousness that is the foundation of God's throne is also the foundation of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can the foundation of God's throne be shaken?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, the foundation of our salvation cannot be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we consider ourselves, we shall realize that we are not lovable or worthy of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We simply do not deserve anything from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He put Christ to death on our behalf, and He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we can boldly say to God, "If You do not deal with me according to Your righteousness, Your throne will be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The important issue is not whether or not I shall be saved or perish; it is whether or not You will allow the foundation of Your throne to be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God, I remind You of Your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ has died for my sins, and He is now at Your right hand as proof that You have received His payment for all my debts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Your righteousness, You have no choice except to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are legally bound to forgive me of my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O Father God, I appreciate Your love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But now I stand before You in Your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because You are righteous, You must forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have you ever prayed to God in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It pleases Him when we pray like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a prayer that knows God's righteousness and appeals to God according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our God is righteous, and the gospel of Christ is the power of God because the righteousness of God is revealed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a divine righteousness is a strong attribute of God.</S>
