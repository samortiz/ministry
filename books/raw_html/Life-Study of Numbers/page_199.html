<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A VITAL SKETCH<br>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>IN THE BOOKS OF EXODUS, LEVITICUS,<br>AND NUMBERS CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY<br>WITH HIS CHOSEN AND REDEEMED PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19</H1><P>In this message we come to the conclusion of the vital sketch of the divine revelation in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers concerning God's economy with His chosen and redeemed people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. A FULL TYPE<br>OF THE CHURCH IN THE MYSTICAL UNION<br>WITH THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST,<br>THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF THE PROCESSED<br>AND DISPENSING TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Apparently the Old Testament has nothing to do with the church. Actually the history of Israel recorded in the Old Testament is a picture of the church life. We need to have this understanding as we read Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. If we have this view, then we will see that in the divine revelation in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers we have a full type of the church in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Full Type of the Church</H2><P>Let us first consider the full type of the church and then the matter of the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Chosen by God</H2><P>Deuteronomy 7:6 says, "You are a holy people to Jehovah your God; Jehovah your God has chosen you, from among all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth, to be a people for His personal treasure." In type, this indicates that the church has been chosen by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Redeemed from God's Judgment<br>and Saved from the Bondage of the Fall</H2><P>The typology in Exodus 1, 12, and 14 indicates that the church has been redeemed from God's judgment and saved from the bondage of the fall. As believers today, we know this and have experienced it.</P>
