   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this lesson we will continue to see how to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through living in the Body of Christ in the progressing stage of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Being Mingled Together with God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Body we are being mingled together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 12:23-24 says, Those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word blended has the connotation of being tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Amplified New Testament supplements the word blended with mingled,harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has blended together the various members of the Body of Christ to be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be blended in the Body is to be mingled and blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through this blending we are coordinated, balanced, and adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be blended is to be balanced by dealing with one s extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the local churches there are many saints with different dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some are very spiritual, and some are not so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spiritual ones need to blend with those who are not so spiritual so that the spiritual ones can be properly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a need for weaker ones; they test the genuineness of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we should not expect every saint to be a spiritual giant; this is absolutely not according to the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Holy Scriptures, we all need to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hot ones need to be blended with the cold ones, the quick ones with the slow ones, and the spiritual ones with the not so spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body is built up through all the different members the comely and the less honorable, the strong and the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The different members should not be arranged into different categories; rather, all must be blended together in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are blended together, the uncomely ones share the comeliness of the comely ones, and the weak ones receive the nourishing and support of the stronger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, the Body is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have not been blended into the Body, it will be impossible for us to be built together and for us to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The quick ones have no way to coordinate with the slow ones unless both are willing to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the blending, it is impossible for two saints to become one in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our experience the blending often comes from the coordination in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church life is a life of always needing to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God not only places the members of Christ in the Body, He also blends the Body together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church life there are people with different skin colors and of different races, nationalities, and social ranks; however, we are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is possible only through God blending the members of the Body together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He blends us by the inner life and through His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything the Lord does in the Body is a matter of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the blending of the Body is also a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more God blends, adjusts, and balances us, the more He dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The balancing, adjusting, coordinating, and blending are all related to the divine dispensing, that is, the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us.</S>
