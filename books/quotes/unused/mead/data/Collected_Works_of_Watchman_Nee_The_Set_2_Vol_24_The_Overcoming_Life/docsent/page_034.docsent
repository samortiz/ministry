   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FAITH BEING THE SUBSTANTIATION OF GOD'S FACT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 11:1 speaks of the importance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the only verse in the whole Bible that gives the definition of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many ways to translate the word "substantiation."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a difficult word to translate from Greek to English.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "substantiation" means the capacity to make something real.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, we have the shape of the lamps, the color of the walls, and the sound of the organ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can these shapes, colors, and sounds become real to us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only thing that proves the existence of color is our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here is a picture in beautiful green, red, and yellow colors, but the beautiful colors can only be substantiated through the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the eyes, the colors could not be substantiated no matter how beautiful they are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sound of the organ is very beautiful, but it can only be substantiated by the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A deaf person will not be able to substantiate sound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The eyes cannot substantiate sound, and hands cannot substantiate sound.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the ears can substantiate sound.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Different objects have different shapes: some are cubic, while others are spherical, flat, triangular, or curved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One can only substantiate these shapes by the vision of the eyes or the touch of the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, it is one thing for objects to exist, and it is another thing for the existence of these things to be substantiated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are millions of objects on the earth, but all of them are dependent upon a certain ability in order to be substantiated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is a painting with mountains, water, flowers, grass, and trees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The scenery is beautiful, and if you have eyes, you can appreciate the beauty of the painting and tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But suppose a person was born blind and has never seen color his whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you tell him about red and that it is attractive, he will ask, "What is red?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may tell him about green and that it is lovely, but he will ask, "What is green?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can only say that red is red and green is green.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the painting exists, he cannot appreciate how wonderful it is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the scenery in the picture is wonderful, there is no way he can enjoy this wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have a sister here who can play the piano very well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who have ears and understand music can appreciate the music that she plays.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, those who are deaf or do not understand music cannot testify to the beauty of the music.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of God's facts are real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, these facts of God can only be substantiated by faith, because faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A nice painting may have beautiful scenery, but a blind man cannot see it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, one cannot say that the painting does not exist because he has not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The painting exists as a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not one sees, it is still a painting, and the beautiful colors are still present.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The question is whether or not you have received the benefit from the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those with sight will find enjoyment from the painting; they will receive the benefit from it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has died and shed His blood on the cross for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But some have the faith to substantiate this fact of the Lord's death, and they receive the benefit from it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some do not have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The death of the Lord on the cross is still a fact, but they are unable to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the importance of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need faith to substantiate a spiritual fact just as we need eyes, ears, and hands to substantiate physical objects.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In spiritual matters, we need faith to substantiate the reality of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The hand substantiates the shape of objects, and the ear perceives sound, but the hand cannot feel nor can the ear hear colors.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Colors can only be substantiated by the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is also true with spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, the Lord is the Head and we are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This union is a fact, and there is no possibility of any separation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same way, the Lord is the vine and we are the branches, and there is no possibility of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we believe this, we will receive the benefit of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people confess that the Lord is the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But they do not have the juice, the life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They cannot bear fruit because they do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not a mental understanding of a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the seeing of a fact and the substantiation of it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have heard that the Lord has died on the cross and shed His blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may even agree with others that the Lord has died on the cross and shed His blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have also heard that the Lord is the vine and we are the branches, and we may agree with others that He is the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have heard that the Lord Jesus is our life and living within us, and we may even agree with others that He is our life and living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet this alone cannot substantiate these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, we may have put ourselves aside and have already realized that we are powerless and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may have already let go, but these are only the things we should do on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the positive side, we should still substantiate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a wonderful thing!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It only takes a second, and the accomplished facts of Christ will be substantiated in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here is a beautiful painting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How do you know that it is beautiful?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You know it because you have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How do you know about all the riches in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You know because you have seen them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Colossians says that we are made full in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How do we know that we are made full in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We know because we have seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we look at ourselves, we do not see any fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But we are told that we are made full in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Are we made full in Christ yet?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord has given us all the fullness and given us grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do we have them yet?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is not a question of whether we have them in our head but whether or not we have such a faith in our heart.</S>
