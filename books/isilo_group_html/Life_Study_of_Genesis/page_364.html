We also can see God's sovereignty in our environment. No one told the servant to go to the city of Nahor, the city of Abraham's brother. He just went there and at the well he met Rebekah, Nahor's granddaughter. Nothing was accidental; everything was ordained before the foundation of the world and was carried out through Abraham's servant, a man who trusted in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(3) Rebekah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(a) Chaste, Kind, and Diligent</H2><P>In verse 16 we are told that Rebekah was "very fair to look upon, a virgin." Rebekah was chaste and pure. She was also kind and diligent (vv. 18-20). When Abraham's servant asked for a drink, she immediately gave it to him. She also drew water for his camels. It was hard work for a young woman to draw water out of the well and pour it into the trough for ten camels to drink, but she did it. If the young sisters want to be under God's sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent. Any young woman who is unkind and sloppy should remain single. When people ask you to do one thing, you must do two things for them. And the second thing should far surpass the first thing. You should not only give a man water to drink, but should also draw water for his ten camels. If you do this, you will be qualified to obtain your husband, your Isaac. This is some advice to all the young single sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(b) Absolute</H2><P>Rebekah was absolute (vv. 57-58, 61). Although Rebekah had never seen Isaac, she was willing to go to him without hesitation. She did not say to her mother, "Mother, I have never seen Isaac. Perhaps I should correspond with him first and afterward have him pay us a visit. Then I could decide whether or not to marry him." Rebekah did not talk in this way. Although her brother and mother were hesitating, wanting her to stay for at least ten days, she said, "I will go." She was absolute.</P><P>During the past forty years, I have seen a number of young sisters who developed mental problems as a result of considering marriage. Some spent days, weeks, months, and even years considering whether a particular brother was the one whom God had prepared for them. When such sisters came to me, I said, with a rebuking tone, "If you feel he is the brother, marry him blindly. But if he is not the one, forget about him and don't talk about it. The more you consider, the more you bother God, yourself, and me. How can I tell you yes or no? If I say yes, you will say that I do not know him well. If I say no, you will feel unhappy because you have already fallen in love with him. Don't think about it anymore. Either marry him or forget about him." I was serious in telling them this. Young sisters, if you want to be married, you must learn to be kind, diligent, and absolute.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_363.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_365.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 364</div><br></body></html>
