   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 12 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 12:13 ...In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eph 4:4 One Body and one Spirit...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Formation of the Church continued</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of His resurrection,...after showing the disciples His hands and His side John 20:20 , the Lord breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 .... Then after appearing to His disciples for a period of forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He, having again received the consummated Spirit, poured out this Spirit upon all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>174</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible clearly shows us that the Holy Spirit is with us in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>175 In the Lord s resurrection the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples John 20:22 for their spiritual being and living essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord s ascension the Spirit of ascension power, poured upon the disciples, is symbolized...by the wind and is for the disciples ministry and move economically Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>176</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we can see that the church was formed by two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first step was the Lord s breathing the Spirit into the believers for their spiritual existence and being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second step was the Lord s pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon the believers, baptizing them into one Body....The outpouring of the Spirit is the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To the Holy Spirit it is an outpouring, but to Christ the Head it is a baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus referred to the baptism in the Holy Spirit in Acts 1:5....This has been accomplished in two sections involving the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem 2:1-4 and the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea 10:24, 44-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in the Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is in the one Spirit that we were all baptized into the one living Body to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>177</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Formed with Two Kinds of Material</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is formed not only with all the believers as the extrinsic form but also with Christ as the intrinsic constituent....The Christ constituted into us is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the constitution of the resurrected Christ, who embodies the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the church is a living constitution of the Triune God who has been wrought into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>178 In Ephesians 4:4-6 there is a record or a portrait of this constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 4 says, One Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The one Body is the structure, the frame, and within this frame there is the one Spirit, who is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The one Lord is the element v. 5 , and the one Father is the source v. 6 ....A group of chosen human beings becomes the very structure, the very frame, of this constitution, and they are constituted with the Triune God as the essence, element, and source.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the universe there is such a wonderful constitution, and this constitution is the church as the organism of the Triune God for Him to move, to act, to fulfill His purpose, and to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>179</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul addresses the church of God which is in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>...In nature constitution, and content the church is universal in God, but in expression and practice the church is local in a definite place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>180 Without the local churches, there is no practicality and actuality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>181 Universally, all the churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of that universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, a local church is not the Body but only a part of the Body, an expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>182</S>
