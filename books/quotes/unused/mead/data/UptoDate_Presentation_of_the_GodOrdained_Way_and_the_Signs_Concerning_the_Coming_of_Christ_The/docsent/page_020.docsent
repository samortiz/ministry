   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Giving heed to the prophetic word 2 Pet 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message I will fellowship with you about the prophecy concerning Christ's coming and concerning the consummation of the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This may be considered my favorite subject from the time I was saved to the present time, a period of more than sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SEVENTY WEEKS BEING APPORTIONED OUT BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we speak concerning Christ's coming, we cannot avoid speaking concerning the consummation of the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The age we are in today is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before this age there was the age of the law, beginning with Moses' decreeing of the law and continuing for approximately one thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the first coming of Christ, the age of the law was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ brought grace and reality, and on the cross He accomplished God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus the age of grace began.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The age of grace is the age of the church; it is also called the age of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This age began with Christ's first coming, and it will end with Christ's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ comes back, He will conclude this age and bring in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The conclusion, the consummation, of this age is not something that takes place in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the revelation of the Bible, it will be at least seven years long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, if we want to understand Christ's coming back, we must have a clear understanding concerning the last seven years of the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These seven years are not recorded in the New Testament; they are recorded in Daniel 9:24-27.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These four verses tell us a great key point, which is also a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this point, we will first mention the background in which the book of Daniel was written.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At about 606 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, conquered Jerusalem and carried away all the children of Israel as captives, among whom was Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time Daniel was a youth in his teens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He loved God and feared God, and for God's holy city and holy temple he humbled himself before God, praying and giving thanks to God three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time when the seventy years of Israel's captivity were about to be completed, he understood by the books that contained the word of God to Jeremiah that the number of years determined by God for the accomplishing of the desolation of Jerusalem was seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, he sought God by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God sent an angel to speak to Daniel: "Seventy weeks are apportioned out for your people and for your holy city, to close transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy place" Dan 9:24, new translation .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The seventy weeks were divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first section consists of seven weeks, counting from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes Neh 2:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, King Cyrus defeated Babylon, and, moved by God, he made a proclamation that all the children of Israel should go back to rebuild the holy temple; then, Artaxerxes issued a decree for the rebuilding of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The period from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the restoration and rebuilding was a total of forty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus Jerusalem was built again with street and moat Dan 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second section of the seventy weeks consists of sixty-two weeks, from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of the anointed One Messiah Christ , a total of four hundred thirty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that very year, the four hundred thirty-fourth year, on the fourteenth day of the first month, the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At a later time, the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; the desolations are determined Dan 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the first section plus the second section equals sixty-nine weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this point the seventy weeks were interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A long period of time would follow before the last week would come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not possible to find out the length of this interval.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This interval is the age of the church, which is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is also called the age of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This age begins and ends with the two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this age, everything that God did, is doing, and will do is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, Christ's incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His becoming the Spirit to enter into His believers that they may be formed into the church as the members of His Body are all mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although today we come from different places and speak with different accents, we have the same Christ dwelling in us to make us one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only is Christ a mystery, but also the church is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we are different in our birth, in our nationality, in the color of our skin, and in our race, we pursue the same Lord, and we are co-witnesses of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, one day we will be transfigured together to meet before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are the mysteries that have been hidden from the ages, but at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, at the consummation of the present age, all these mysteries will be finished and concluded, and everything will become open and manifest Rev 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When will this age come to an end?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When will the last week come?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible clearly reveals that at the beginning of the last week, Antichrist will make a firm covenant with Israel for seven years; in the middle of the seven years he will break the covenant, terminate Israel's sacrifices and oblations to God, and persecute those who fear God Dan 9:27; Rev 12:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will set up the idol of abomination in the temple to replace God, and he will carry out a great destruction to cause desolation Matt 24:15 until Christ comes to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then Christ will slay Antichrist by the breath of His mouth and bring Antichrist to nothing by the manifestation of His coming 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 19:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the plain words and the revelation in the Bible, the coming of the last week is related to the following few things: Antichrist and the restored Roman Empire, the restoration of Israel including the rebuilding of the temple , the great tribulation, and the rapture of the saints.</S>
