   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I shall begin by assuming that the issue of God's existence is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all believe that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As those who desire to know the truth, we must go one step further to find out what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is the greatest Unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must spend some time to find out about this unknown One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The next step now is to know what kind of a God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE BIRTH OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past few thousand years man has been inquiring about the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is He kind or is He righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is He indifferent towards us, or is He extremely interested in human affairs?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These types of questions are the direct cause of all human religions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Religion is man's inquiry about God and his explanation of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through these explanations, different men have arrived at different concepts about God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What kind of God is He?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a big question.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also a very serious question.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have all given our thought to this subject at one time or another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question might even have occurred to our little mind when we were five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All men, educated or ignorant, have been intrigued by this question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It comes naturally after some contemplation and observation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAN'S CONJECTURE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But a person trying to speculate about God is like an ant attempting to understand a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is extremely difficult for the little creature to try to realize our life, nature, and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way it is impossible for us to try to comprehend God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, in the past few thousand years, all kinds of people, theologians and philosophers alike, have done much thinking about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What has God been doing all this time?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Has He been indifferent to us or has He tried to reveal Himself to us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is God's attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you think He would say, "I am God and have nothing to do with human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not care what you think about Me. I shall stay in heaven as God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let the mortals be ignorant!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or do you think He has a desire to reveal Himself to man and visit him?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I was in India, I saw some people lying naked on beds studded with nails.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some walked with bare feet on burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These people devoted a great deal of energy to seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What has God done to them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Did He hide Himself and take no notice of them at all?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Has He not kept Himself as a perpetual mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a great question.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to consider it scientifically and objectively in order to find out what God is like.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD IS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A few years ago I spoke on a similar subject to some medical students in an auditorium in Cheloo University.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said that man is an organism with a life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God also is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man's life is higher than that of the lower animals, and God's life is even higher than that of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I asked the students, "Since we realize that all living organisms have some common laws and express some common traits, can you name them?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Different ones then started to bring up different points.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the end we summed up the discussion in this way: all living organisms contain two common characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You can call these characteristics their common expressions or their common laws.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, every life wants to preserve itself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It tends to reproduce itself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is the ability to produce posterity, to continue its own life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, every life wants to have fellowship with other lives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It cannot stand being by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a man cannot find fellowship with another human being, he goes to dogs, cats, fish, or birds and makes friends with animals.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All living creatures desire fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Based on these two characteristics of life, namely, the preservation of itself and fellowship with others, laws of human government are instituted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, the death penalty reflects a convict's desire to preserve his own life; punishment comes in the form of taking away and terminating such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the way to inflict suffering on a life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Imprisonment, as a less serious punishment, cuts him off from having fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This reversal of the life principle becomes then a suffering for him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From this we see that punishment is applied according to the principles of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>With these two chief characteristics in mind, let us turn to the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is an organism of a higher order than human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is naturally governed by this law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can know God by the characteristics and distinctive features of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this we can deduce whether or not God wants to have fellowship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>NATURAL RELIGION VERSUS REVELATIONAL RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are two kinds of religion: religion based on natural concepts and religion based on revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Natural religion starts with man as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is the one that is seeking after God and studying about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What then is revelational religion?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Revelational religion comes directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is the One who comes to reveal things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man's thoughts are often useless fancies.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God's revelation alone is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christianity is different from all other natural religions in that it is a religion that comes from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christianity begins from God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is God who comes to seek out man, rather than man who seeks after God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I will not try to persuade you to believe in Christianity or to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I will only make a few suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We will treat the subject in the same way as if we were solving a problem in geometry.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will start from the suppositions and then deduce our arguments step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We will examine our reasonings to see if they are sound and if our conclusions are logical.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As in mathematics, with some problems we work forwards, while with others we work backwards.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At any rate, in the end we should be able to tell whether or not a supposition is justified.</S>
