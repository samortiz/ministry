   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Threatening Them as a Roaring Lion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Peter 5:8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The devil not only deceives men in secret, but seeks to devour those who are not sober and watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Martin Luther died, Satan related his sins to him in detail, threatening him, that he might doubt his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in the end Luther overcame Satan by the grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From this we see that Satan always threatens and seeks to devour men when they seem to be at their weakest hour.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is one among the many great works of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan's plan is to intimidate man by taking the offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a lion roars to intimidate the beasts and then seeks to devour them, in the same way Satan threatens the believers, causing them to fail through fear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times he has nothing besides his threatening!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who see that all that he has are mere threats will no longer fear his threatenings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, those who take in his threats will experience much of what he threatens them with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do we not constantly have the experience of his empty threats?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then why should we be afraid of him?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Making Them Proud</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 Timothy 3:6</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil" 1 Tim 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after believing, many Christians advance quite well spiritually and have some results in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point Satan would take the opportunity to come in and cause such ones to become proud and fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We often see that great war heroes and even great revivalists can fall through sin because of the common wiles of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He often induces men to take God's grace for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then when grace works in their hearts, he causes them to have a high esteem of themselves, to think that they are different from other people, and even that they are something special!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan is most pleased to see men proud of themselves because this is his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Causing Them to Do Things beyond God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Samuel 24:1</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"It incited David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah'" 2 Sam 24:1, NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"It" here should refer to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not order David to number the people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But because Satan likes to see men suffering God's wrath as he also suffers, he incited David to do something beyond God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will either hold men back from advancing or push them to do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians today often carelessly think that all promptings are from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Little do they know that Satan can prompt men also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The numbering of Israel and Judah did not seem to be so great a sin, but whenever men act apart from God's will, Satan's plot is carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Believers are often lacking in "spiritual discernment"; when they are stirred up to do something which they do not perceive as evil, they deem that it is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we should not judge the source of such promptings by considering whether the thing is good or evil; we must judge these promptings by considering whether or not it is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are many good things which are outside of God's will!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Causing Them to Doubt God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 3:1</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God clearly charged man in Genesis 2:17 not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, the devil said, "Hath God said?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every Scripture is God's Word and can be used to attack Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan is afraid of this; therefore, he causes man to doubt the Bible as the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The alarming thing is that most of the doubters of the Bible are believers rather than outsiders!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The devil causes men first to doubt God's word, then to believe in his own word, and finally to fall into sin Gen 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His working in this way has never ceased since the time of the garden of Eden.</S>
