   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The water Lev 1:9, 13 signifies the Spirit of life John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While the Lord Jesus was living His human life on earth, this Spirit of life, the Holy Spirit, continually kept away from Him all defiling factors.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason the Lord Jesus was never defiled or contaminated by anything He contacted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit as the living water within Him kept Him clean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Leviticus 1:9 and 13, the offerer was to wash the inwards and the legs of his offering with water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This certainly does not signify that Christ needs to be washed by those who offer Him as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The slaughtering of the offering by the offerer is a review of the offerer's experience in his daily life of Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The principle is the same with the washing of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The washing is a review of the offerer's experience of Christ's life, a life in which He was continually washed by the indwelling Holy Spirit from any contaminating factor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit, here signified by the water, preserved Christ from being contaminated by outward matters He contacted while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The offerer has experienced this in his daily life, and he therefore reviews and demonstrates this as he offers Christ as his burnt offering.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is proved by Hebrews 12:29, which says, "Our God is also a consuming fire."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fire in Leviticus 1 may be considered God's mouth with which He receives and accepts what we offer to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the Sin Offering, the Fire Being the Judging Fire for Man's Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the sin offering the fire is the judging fire for man's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burning of the sin offering is a sign of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is mentioned in 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apparently the burnt offering fire and the sin offering fire are two different fires.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually there is just one fire with two different functions the function of accepting and the function of judging.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Burning of the Sweet Incense</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The burning of the burnt offering is as the burning of sweet incense Exo 30:7-8; Lev 16:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Hebrew for "offer up in smoke," a special term used for the burning on the altar of burnt offering, implies the matter of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the burning on the altar of burnt offering is as the burning of sweet incense.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This burning produced a sweet savor ascending to God for His pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
