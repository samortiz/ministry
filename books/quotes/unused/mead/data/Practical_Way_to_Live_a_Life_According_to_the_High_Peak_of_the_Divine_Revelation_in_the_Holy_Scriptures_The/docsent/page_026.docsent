   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ is also the new man Col 3:10-11; Eph 2:15; 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How could the church be both a wife and a man?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not according to our human logic, but in the biblical logic, Christ's wife is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The new man is the corporate God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first God-man, the firstborn Son of God, is the Head of this corporate God-man the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The many God-men, the many sons of God, are the Body of this corporate God-man the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both the Head and the Body of this new man are in resurrection: The first God-man, Christ, became the Head of the corporate new man in resurrection, in which He became the Firstborn from the dead Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The many God-men, the believers in Christ, became the Body of the corporate new man in resurrection, in which they, the natural men in race, in religion, in culture, and in social rank, became the regenerated sons of God 1 Pet 1:3a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the natural life we belong to different races, such as Chinese, American, and Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But all the believing Chinese, Americans, and Japanese were regenerated to be something new, and this is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the new man there is no more race.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is not only the Head but also every member of this new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Colossians 3:10 and 11 say that in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, Christ is everyone and is in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not only the Head but also all the members of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>F. The New Creation of God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body of Christ is the new creation of God Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This new creation is the believers in Christ, the corporate new man, the aggregate of the many God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They all are in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the old creation, they were in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But they have been transferred from Adam into Christ by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are also in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The new creation of God was produced out of the old creation of God in the resurrection of Christ through the death of Christ Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 2:15 reveals that Christ on His cross put the old creation to an end and created in Himself in resurrection a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The processed and consummated Triune God consummated a new creation, out of His old creation, with Himself as the creating element.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must keep in mind the difference between the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The old creation has no element of God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the new creation is full of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has constituted Himself as the element into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>G. The Household of God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Body of Christ is the household of God Eph 2:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the household of the faith the universal family of God Gal 6:10 , composed of God as the Father and the believers in Christ, the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God the Father has a great family of many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father is God and the sons are "small gods" in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a father is a man, are not his sons men?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the father is a man, the sons all must be men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the divine family, the Father is God, so all the sons are gods, the many God-men, in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The processed and consummated Triune God is mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God abides in man and man abides in God, coinhering and living as one person John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some in the early history of the church heretically taught that the mingling of God and man produced a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in the mingling of God and man, the two entities become one, with their own respective natures remaining distinct and without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the truth.</S>
