        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE IMPORTANT PRACTICES<br />
IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider three important practices in our Christian life&mdash;pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and preaching the gospel. Every believer should make a resolution before the Lord to practice these three matters. Such resolutions are a great help.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A RESOLUTION BEING TO RESPOND<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S GRACE</h2>
<p>Every great matter in the Christian life requires a resolution. We cannot say that Christians should leave everything to the Lord&rsquo;s grace, that resolutions are regulations, or that we should not make resolutions. The Bible says, &ldquo;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you&rdquo; (James 4:8). The condition for the Lord&rsquo;s drawing near to us is our drawing near to Him. In addition, the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (John 15:4). The Lord wants to draw near to us and abide in us, but there is a condition: we first need to draw near to Him and abide in Him. This does not mean that our human effort is effective but that the Lord has graced us and is waiting for us to take the initiative to respond to Him.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a brother comes to a love feast. Unless he uses his hands, the food cannot enter into his mouth. No matter how rich the food may be, he must respond by picking up the food, opening his mouth, and putting the food in his mouth. If he does not use his hands or open his mouth, no one can help him. Hence, we will be fed if we receive, but we will be hungry if we do not receive, because receiving love and grace is our response. Suppose there are forty guests at the love feast, but only thirty-eight respond. Those who respond will be happy and satisfied, but those who do not respond will be hungry. The host cannot be held responsible for the guests who are hungry, because he has given them food and drink. The problem is not a lack of love from the host but a lack of response from the guests.</p>
<p>The same applies to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. He has done everything and has given us everything. He died on the cross for us, accomplished the work of redemption for us, and dealt with the problems of sin and the enemy for us. He resurrected from the dead, satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and has given Himself to us in this Spirit. He is now waiting for us to respond to Him. If we would draw near to Him&mdash;respond to what He has done and given to us&mdash;He will draw near to us. An open vessel can be filled. If our being is open, we will be filled. If the opening of a vessel is turned downward, it cannot be filled with rain even in a downpour. If we do not receive grace, we should not say that God&rsquo;s grace is not sufficient or that God is a respecter of persons and gives grace to others but not to us. Rather, we should question whether we have responded to Him. The Lord has done everything for us and has given us everything. He requires us only to respond to Him.</p>
<p>The Bible can say that the Lord will draw near to us if we draw near to Him, because He is waiting for us to draw near to Him and to receive Him. The Bible can say that the Lord will abide in us if we abide in Him, because the Lord is already abiding in us. However, we will not sense His abiding in us unless we abide in Him. A person who does not read the Bible or pray in order to draw near to the Lord can be moved by the Lord occasionally but will not always sense that the Lord abides in him. But a person who prays, reads the Bible, and fellowships with the Lord will always sense that the Lord abides in him. According to our experience, it is possible to sense that we are filled with the Lord when we pray and fellowship with Him. This is to experience His abiding by our abiding in Him and fellowshipping with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TO KNOW THE LORD</h2>
<p>There are a few great matters that require resolutions. These matters are: pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and preaching the gospel. We should consider the pursuit of the knowledge of Christ to be excellent. In the preceding chapter we saw that Christ is both God and man and that He is in us. He is God; man calls Him the great God. He is man; He appeared on the earth as a small and lowly man. Because He is God in us, we are so enlarged that we can forbear and accept anything. Because He is a man in us, we are so low that we can accommodate and endure anything. His life is both great and small, because He is both God and man. This is truly wonderful. There is no end to pursuing the Lord or to knowing Him. Therefore, we must make a resolution to know Him. We should not resign our knowing Him to fate, nor should we live on the spirituality of others.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
