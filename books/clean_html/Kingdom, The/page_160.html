<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM<br>TOWARD RICHES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Laying up Riches</H2><P>We continue with the fifth aspect of the reality of the kingdom&#151;the attitude of the children of the kingdom of the heavens toward mammon, or riches (Matt. 6:19-23). What should be the attitude of the children of the kingdom toward riches? First of all, we should not lay up for ourselves treasures upon the earth (Matt. 6:19-21). You may ask: "Are not savings accounts the laying up of treasures on earth?" It depends on your motive. There is nothing wrong with making some preparation for next year or for your children's education. In fact, in the Epistles we are told that parents should lay up something for their children (2 Cor. 12:14). We must educate them in a proper way, and this will be expensive. As parents, we are responsible to care for our children. This is not a matter of outward regulations. We all need to pray concerning these things. The Lord's wisdom will then be with us, and we will be clear how much we should save for the future and for our children. If we are faithful to the Lord, He will show us what to do. The basic matter is to check our motive. The governing principle is that to lay up treasures on earth is against God's economy and expresses a kind of unbelief in His mercy and care. May the Lord's wisdom be with us in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Serving Riches</H2><P>The second aspect of the children of the kingdom toward riches is not to serve both riches and God (Matt. 6:24). Although we may have a savings account, we must not serve it as we would serve God. God, not money or riches, is the only master whom we should serve. We should serve God and nothing else.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Trusting Our Father for Our Living</H2><P>The third point is that we are trusting our Father for our living. The children of the kingdom trust in their Father for their living even as the birds of the heaven and lilies of the field do (Matt. 6:25-31). The Lord Jesus was wise. He used the birds to illustrate the Lord's care for our eating and the lilies to illustrate the Lord's care for our clothing. The Lord Jesus said, "Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father nourishes them" (Matt. 6:26). They have no field or barn, but so many servants are serving them. All the rich people serve the birds in the air. The birds enjoy what the rich people do for them. The rich people have a few barns, but the birds have many barns.</P><P>The Lord continued by saying, "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, neither do they spin; Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these" (Matt. 6:28-29). Who gave the lilies this clothing? God did! We should be like the birds in the air and the lilies on the earth, trusting our Father in the heavens to take care of us.</P><P>Some who are loose and lazy may find this suitable to their natural concept. They may say, "This is wonderful! There is no need for us to work. God will feed and clothe us. We are like the birds of the air. There is no need for us to do anything. God will take care of us." However, if they take this attitude, God will not take care of them. Never forget that there are some following verses. Matthew 6:33 says, "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you." We must seek the kingdom. We should not be loose or lazy. When we seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness of God, He will certainly take care of us. However, we must not be loose, but serious in seeking God's kingdom and righteousness.</P>
