   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GRAFTED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to grow in life, we need to see that the Christian life is a grafted life Rom 11:24; 6:5; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two trees of diverse kinds cannot be grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They cannot grow together because they are not of one kind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because man was created according to God's kind, man and God can be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are not clear about the principle of grafting, we will not be able to properly apprehend the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will make mistakes related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many Christians emphasize certain verses related to the Christian life, such as Romans 6:5 and Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They feel that these verses refer to an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the grafted life is not an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christian life is a mingling of two lives, a life of two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both lives still exist in the grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus was a fully grafted person, a person of two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, when He lived on the earth He was the real God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, He was a man expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was God expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also are persons of two natures, the human and the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we receive the divine life, our human life is not ended.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our human life still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though the human and divine lives are of one kind, one is stronger than the other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are now living by a weaker life with a stronger life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever a weaker life is put with a stronger life, the stronger one subdues the weaker one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sisters are the weaker vessels married to the brothers, who are the stronger vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, the wife takes the husband's surname as her own.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this sense, the wives are subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On their wedding day, the sisters realize this and put a covering over their head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the wedding only the husband's head can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the two should live one life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the meeting we may joyfully proclaim, "I am a part of Christ, I am one with Christ, and I am mingled with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, after the meeting, we may desire to be the head and want Christ to be the covered one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must always remember that we are the wife and He is the Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As such, we are two persons living one life together without separation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One lives in the other and through the other.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way the grafted life can come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we love, we do not love by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We love with Christ, through Christ, and in Christ, and Christ loves through us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of love does not express our human virtue alone, but our human virtue with Christ's divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His divine love becomes the very essence of our human love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not two loves existing together, but one love living in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This can be compared to a hand in a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The hand and the glove are not two parties merely existing together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the hand is put into the glove, making the two objects one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are loving others, it is Christ who is loving, but not by Himself; Christ is loving through us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the "hand" and we are the "glove," not as a pair, but as one in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The human life has the divine life within it as its content, and the divine life has the human life as its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If this is not clear to us, we can never understand the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that there is such a thing as grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hymn #482 in Hymns was written by A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse three says:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This the secret nature hideth,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Harvest grows from buried grain;</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A poor tree with better grafted,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn to see the grafted life and learn to exercise and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be joined with Christ as a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be joined to Him in the way of coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He lives in us and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Christian life is a grafted life, the mingling of two lives which are close in kind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To see this and practice it requires us to be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to walk in life according to the spirit and do nothing without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should do everything with Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not have the assurance that we are doing something with Christ and through Christ, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This principle must be practiced throughout our entire Christian life.</S>
