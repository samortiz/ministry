THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST&#151;THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br>BECOMING THE SPIRIT OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God becoming the Spirit of the resurrected Christ (Rom. 8:9). By the Spirit of Christ, we partake of His resurrection life, His resurrection power, His transcendency, and His reigning authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST&#151;THE SPIRIT<br>OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD<br>BECOMING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT OF<br>THE INCARNATED JESUS AND THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God becoming the all-inclusive Spirit of the incarnated Jesus and the resurrected Christ (Phil. 1:19b). To experience the Lord's humanity, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord's resurrection, we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering the apostle Paul experienced both the Lord's suffering in His humanity and the Lord's resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE COMPOUND SPIRIT&#151;THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br>COMPOUNDED WITH CHRIST'S DIVINITY, HUMANITY,<br>DEATH AND ITS SWEET EFFECTIVENESS,<br>AND RESURRECTION AND ITS FRAGRANT POWER</H2><P>The Spirit of God has been compounded. This is typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. This ointment is a compound of olive oil with myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God with divinity, myrrh signifies Christ's death, cinnamon signifies the sweet effectiveness of Christ's death, calamus signifies Christ's resurrection, and cassia signifies the fragrant power of Christ's resurrection. The one hin of olive oil also signifies the unique God, and the four spices of the plant life signify man, the creature of God. This, of course, refers to the humanity of Jesus, or to the Man Jesus. Thus, the compound Spirit is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death and its sweet effectiveness, and resurrection and its fragrant power. The one hin of olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices becomes a compound ointment for anointing.</P><P>Myrrh was used in ancient times to reduce the suffering of death. Cassia was a repellent used to repel snakes and insects. The power of Christ's resurrection is a real repellent. When you live in His power of resurrection, the devil and all the demons will flee away. We can have this experience when we are enjoying the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit of Christ. When we are filled with the Spirit of Christ, we have the resurrection.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_115.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_117.html">Next</a> </body></html>
