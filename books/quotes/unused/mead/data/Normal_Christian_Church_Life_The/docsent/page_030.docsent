   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE BASIS OF UNION AND DIVISION THE FORMING OF LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we observed that the word "church" was only mentioned twice in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is used frequently in the Acts, but we are never explicitly told there how a church was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second chapter speaks of the salvation of about three thousand men, and the fourth chapter of a further five thousand, but nothing whatever is said about these believers forming a church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without a single word of explanation they are referred to in the following chapter as the church "And great fear came upon the whole church" 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the Scriptures call the children of God "the church," without even mentioning how the church came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Acts 8:1, immediately after the death of Stephen, the word is again used, and the connection in this case is clearer than before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"There occurred in that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this passage it is obvious that the believers in Jerusalem are the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So we know now what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It consists of all the saved ones in a given locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later on, in the course of the apostles' first missionary tour, many people were saved in different places through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing is mentioned about their being formed into churches, but in Acts 14:23, it is said of Paul and Barnabas that "they had appointed elders for them in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The groups of believers in these different places are called churches, without any explanation whatever as to how they came to be churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were groups of believers, so they simply were churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever a number of people in any place were saved, they spontaneously became the church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without introduction or explanation of any kind, the Word of God presents such a group of believers to us as a church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The scriptural method of founding a church is simply by preaching the gospel; nothing further is necessary, or even permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If people hear the gospel and receive the Lord as their Savior, then they are a church; there is no need of any further procedure in order to become a church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If in a given place anyone believes on the Lord, as a matter of course he is a constituent of the church in that place; there is no further step necessary in order to make him a constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No subsequent joining is required of him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Provided he belongs to the Lord, he already belongs to the church in that locality; and since he already belongs to the church, his belonging cannot be made subject to any condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If, before recognizing a believer as a member of the church, we insist that he join us, or that he resign his connection elsewhere, then "our church" is decidedly not one of the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we impose any conditions of membership upon a believer in the locality, we are immediately in an unscriptural position, because his being a member of the local church is conditioned only by his being a believer in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the saved ones who belong to the place in which we live belong to the same church as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I mean by the church a scriptural church, and not a man-made organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A local church is a church which comprises all the children of God in a given locality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us note well that the ground of our receiving anyone into the church is that the Lord has already received that one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Him who is weak in faith receive for God has received him" Rom 14:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you" 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our receiving anyone is merely our recognition that the Lord has already received him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our receiving him does not make him a member of the church; rather, it is that we receive him because he is already a member.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he is the Lord's, he is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he is not the Lord's, he is not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we demand anything beyond his reception by the Lord before admitting him to fellowship, then we are not a church at all, but only a sect.</S>
