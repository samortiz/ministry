   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RENEWING OF THE NOUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we were saved, our nous was enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think it is sufficient if we have a new heart, but the Bible speaks not only of this; it also says that our nous needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very clear in the English translation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In some places the English translation is much clearer than the Chinese translation; while in other places, the Chinese translation is much better than the English translation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our nous was new at the time we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But is it renewed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The part that is toward God has been enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But how about the other parts?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that after many are saved, their nous is not renewed; it remains just as it was before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I wish to speak very frankly: the thoughts of many believers today are still like those of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I often sense that the spirit and the heart of many believers are new but that their nous is not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their nous is just the same as the nous of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the nous of the believers has not been renewed, they should not expect to be useful in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, our nous not only needs to be new; it should also be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our problem today is this: at the time we were saved, we had a great revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But since being saved, our nous has not been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being saved was the biggest revelation of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But have we continued to receive any big revelations other than that one time?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that many do not have any other big revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely the revelation of salvation is the greatest revelation of a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a revelation that we will bring into eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But do we continuously receive new revelations?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we first believed in the Lord, why were we enlightened to confess our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why were we not afraid of persecution?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why did we allow our parents and others in the world to oppose us, and why were we willing to forsake the world?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was the nous that enabled us to understand salvation, confess our sins, forsake the world, and allow our parents to persecute us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this light of the nous shone daily in our life, we would not be in the same condition that we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We would truly have a living under the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once there was a girl who loved the world very much and would not forsake it for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day she heard a man preaching in a church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The preaching was not particularly attractive, but the verse he read, "This is the victory which has overcome the world our faith" 1 John 5:4 , was attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word captured the girl.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She heard him repeat it seven or eight times: "This is the victory which has overcome the world our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She had not known what the world was for her entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But that day she realized what the world was.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On that day she put the world away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This realization is the knowledge of the nous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many are not able to put everything away because their nous has not been enlightened to see through it all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Other matters such as listening to a message or working for the Lord are likewise unprofitable if the nous does not cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every time we listen to a message, we need the cooperation of our nous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before we were saved, we would not believe, no matter how people tried to persuade us with various reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But one day we believed because our nous realized something, and that realization could not be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" John 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What are the functions of the nous?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The functions of the nous include the ability to think, judge, and observe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>OF THE UNRENEWED NOUS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is the condition of an unrenewed nous?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will discuss the condition in three aspects: 1 toward man, 2 toward God, and 3 toward ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether or not our nous has been renewed can be determined by these three aspects: toward man, God, and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is determined by how we control our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please take note that nous is the transliteration of the original word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This word is very hard to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If translated "mind," it still cannot fully express the original meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The nous is composed of the power of apprehension and the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The original meaning of this word cannot be expressed if it is translated simply as "apprehension" or "thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, I have no alternative but to use the word nous constantly.</S>
