<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Praying and Calling on His Name</H2><P>Today, all you need to do to receive Christ's redemption and salvation is to pray and call on His name. Just say, "Lord Jesus, I believe in Your work on the cross. I believe that You have died for my sins. I believe that God is satisfied with Your perfect work. I believe that You can save me with Your resurrection life and deliver me from my sinful nature. I accept and receive You. Thank You, Lord Jesus. I am saved!" If you would pray and declare in this way, you will surely be redeemed and saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ's Day-by-Day Salvation</H2><P>The salvation that we receive when we believe is not only a once-for-all salvation but also a day-by-day salvation. Every day we encounter trials and temptations. Even as Christians we can encounter difficult situations while we live on this earth. The Lord has not promised His people that they will be without trials and temptations in this life. But the saving life of Christ is more than able to overcome every trial and temptation (1 Cor. 10:13). The saving life of Christ is a Christian's daily bread (John 6:48) and heavenly air (John 20:22). It nourishes him and supplies him with divine power to overcome all kinds of trials and temptations. The Bible says that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, and that the Lord is rich to all who call on Him (Rom. 10:12-13). By calling on the name of the Lord, "O Lord Jesus!" we are saved from anxiety, frustration, anger, jealousy, stubbornness, and all kinds of sinful desires. Our mind may have doubts, fears, and worries. By calling on the name of the Lord, all these thoughts will go away. This life will even overcome death and all the by-products of death, such as weakness, sighing, groaning, bondage, and depression. By calling on the name of the Lord, we are saved day by day and moment by moment. The Lord is indeed rich to all who call on His name.</P><P>Today what you need to do is to cease your struggling and striving and just come to Christ by faith. Accept Him by calling on His name, and receive Him into your spirit as your Redeemer and Savior. You will experience His redemption and His salvation, and you will also be saved day by day from sin, death, and Satan. You will be a child of God forever, and you will experience His saving power changing your life day by day. May God bless you and cause you to walk the happy and joyful path of living a Christian life in faith.</P>
