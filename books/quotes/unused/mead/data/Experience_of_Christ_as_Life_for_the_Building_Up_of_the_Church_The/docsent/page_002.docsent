   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GROWTH IN LIFE BY THE FLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; Psa 36:9; John 1:4; 11:25; 14:6; 1 John 1:2; 5:12; Col 3:4; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39; Rom 8:2, 6; Rev 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first point we want to cover in this book is how to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church life depends mainly on the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD, CHRIST, THE CHURCH,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense, it is easy to know about God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even the unbelievers know about God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They know that there is an almighty Being in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it is rather hard to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first verse of the Bible in Genesis, God is revealed "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first item revealed in the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, Christ is revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of John says that in the beginning was God, the Word, and the Word became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace and reality 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is God plus something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The revelation in the Scriptures begins with God and goes on to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many human beings know something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But only a small number of people, relatively speaking, know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Jewish people know God, but they do not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thank the Lord that we Christians know not only God but also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the real Christians know Christ, but very few know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go on from the Gospels to Acts, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knowing the church is not as easy as knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the church is revealed in the New Testament, the local churches are revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Genesis God is revealed; in the Gospels Christ is revealed; in Acts the church is revealed; and in Revelation the local churches are revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the Bible goes from God to Christ, from Christ to the church, and from the church to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The local churches are the last point of God's divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 1:11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here there are seven local churches in seven localities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I say again that this is the last point of the divine revelation in all the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those Christians who are advanced know God, Christ, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But thank the Lord that by His mercy, we know God, Christ, the church, and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not held in Genesis, the Gospels, or Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I like Genesis, but I do not want to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I like the biography of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, but I do not want to stay there either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I like Acts, Romans, and Ephesians, but I do not want to remain in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want to stay in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation will bring us into the New Jerusalem, which is revealed in its final chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we will never get out of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will be there for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can get into the New Jerusalem through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the first three chapters of Revelation, there are the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in the last two chapters, there is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are in the local churches, there is no doubt that you will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to be in the beginning of the book of Revelation so that we can know the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A number of spiritual teachers know the church, but not the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They talk much about the book of Ephesians, but they have not entered into the end of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The four main items revealed in God's divine revelation are God, Christ, the church, and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we have the local churches, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we have Christ and God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because God is in Christ, Christ is in the church, and the reality and practicality of the church are in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want to find God, we must come to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to find Christ, we must come to the church, and the reality and practicality of the church are in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, if you are for the local churches, you are for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you have the local church, you have the church; if you have the church, you have Christ; and if you have Christ, you have God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all should declare, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am in the local churches!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to grow in life, we must know the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The local churches are the real expression of the church; the church is the real expression of Christ; and Christ is the real expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, God is expressed through Christ, Christ is expressed through the church, and the church is expressed through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>People may talk about the universal church, but have they ever contacted it?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we can contact is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some might say that when we speak too much about the local church, we make the heavenly church earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we must be clear that the local churches are the real expression of the heavenly church on the earth.</S>
