[1]  Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazarite, to separate himself to Jehovah, he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh or dried grapes.
[2]  He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is upon his head.
[3]  And he shall separate to Jehovah the days of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering, but the former days shall be void because his separation was defiled Num 6:1-12 .
[4]  And she the mother of Samuel made a vow and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your female servant and remember me and not forget Your female servant, but give to Your female servant a male child, then I will give him to Jehovah for all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head 1 Sam 1:11 .
[5]  God s intention was to make the whole nation of Israel a kingdom of priests; however, due to Israel s failure, the Lord chose the tribe of Levi to replace the nation of priests in Israel.
[6]  It is not a matter of being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but of voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him.
[7]  Samuel was not even of the house of Aaron, but he became a priest by being consecrated, separated, and lent to the Lord.
[8]  No matter how much we realize that we are born priests and kings, if we are not willing to separate ourselves unto the Lord, we can never be in the genuine priesthood.
