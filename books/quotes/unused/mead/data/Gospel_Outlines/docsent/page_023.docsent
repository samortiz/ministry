   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Twenty-two THE ELECTION OF GRACE Scripture: Gen 25:21-26; Rom 9:10-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Grace is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Election is also the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s salvation is not of works</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This gospel message is to correct men s wrong concept of placing emphasis on good works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First point out that everyone has a concept that men s work counts before God, and that men s work can please God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nearly all religions rely on works for God s reward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible reveals to us that God s salvation has nothing at all to do with men s works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The revelation of the Bible is contrary to men s thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Use the story of Jacob as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob was a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God had determined to grant him salvation before he was even born, much less before he could perform any works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that God s salvation is not of men s works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s grace is free Romans 4:4 Make it clear that grace does not require man to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Make it clear that works require a price; it takes effort.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Works are contradictory to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The two do not go together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that it is either grace without works, or works without grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Salvation is all of grace Point out that salvation is all of God s grace, which is something God freely gives to men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mention that salvation includes forgiveness, justification, obtaining life, living a holy life, inheriting a heavenly inheritance, and eternal blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these are the elements of God s salvation, which God gives to men freely because of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s election God s election is for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whoever receives God s salvation is one of God s elect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Election is the procedure, whereas salvation is the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So God s election is for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation is by grace, and election is also by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Use Jacob s story as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jacob was saved by God, and he was elected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was all of God s grace and not of his own works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Receiving God s election God s election is made known to us through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the gospel God announces to us that God has chosen us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To believe the gospel is to receive the election, and to reject the gospel is to reject the election.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fact that God allows you to hear the gospel now means that God has stretched forth His hand to choose you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The question now is whether you believe the gospel or reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To believe the gospel you must repent, confess, and receive Christ as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who receive Christ are the elected ones, and by their receiving they become the saved ones.</S>
