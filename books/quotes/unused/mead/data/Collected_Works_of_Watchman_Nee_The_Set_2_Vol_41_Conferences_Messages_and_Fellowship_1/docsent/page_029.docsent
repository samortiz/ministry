   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Trying to Make It</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we realize that we cannot make it, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we realize that we cannot make it, we must not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know many brothers and sisters who have come to me and wept before me and before the Lord about their inability to overcome their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are not like others, who let everything go by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are very remorseful about their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They feel that they cannot get through if they do not overcome their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Over a dozen people have come to me and said that if they cannot overcome their sin, they would rather die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What should we do when we realize that we cannot overcome our sin and are completely powerless?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we want deliverance, the first thing we should do is not to try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not try to change ourselves or make any resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not waste time in ourselves or make up our minds to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the most crucial step.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people realize that they cannot make it in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They acknowledge that they cannot make it, yet they are constantly trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They still strive and struggle to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they do this, God cannot do anything with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Last summer I met a Western missionary who had one sin which she could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time she did not realize that Christ is her victory, and she did not know that Christ is in her to live for her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet she wanted to experience this life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I asked her, "Do you realize that you cannot make it?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She answered, "I knew that long ago, yet I have one sin which I keep committing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I really cannot overcome it."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I asked, "What do you do when that sin comes to you?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She said, "I pray to resist this temptation, I pray for God to deliver me from it, or I pray for God to grant me the strength so that the sin will not prevail over me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said, "You do not have to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know the rest of your history.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After you pray and stand up, you commit the same sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as you walk out the door, you do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every time after you pray, your sin comes back to you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I then told her, "You have made a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You know very well that you cannot make it, yet you still try to make it and you strive to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When sin comes to you, you still try to fight it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since you know that you cannot make it, why are you still praying, resisting, and asking God to give you the strength to overcome your temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are praying this way because you think that you are still good and that you can still do something."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I then told her that the way to freedom is first to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as she decided to give up on improving, she would be nearer to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She said, "If I sin when I resist, would it not be unthinkable to not resist?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I said, "Resisting means that you are still living and working.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this happens, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you want God to come into you, you must first let go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to realize that God's power is already in you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He can live for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now is not the time to consider who you are, but who God is."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One summer I was preaching the gospel in the villages with over twenty brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The weather was hot, and we could not take our bath indoors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we all went to the river to take our bath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While a few brothers were swimming, one brother had a cramp and began to drown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He kicked his limbs frantically and shouted for help.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One of the brothers among us was Wei-san Wang, who was very good at swimming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had served in the navy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I urged him to quickly jump into the water to save the drowning brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet he stood in the same place and would not move.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was quite desperate and somewhat angry at him for loving his own life so much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the drowning brother was nearly exhausted and sinking, Brother Wang jumped into the water and swam toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With one arm around the drowning one's waist and swimming with the other arm, Brother Wang brought him safely to shore.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later I asked Brother Wang, "Why did you not save him earlier?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You could have saved him some suffering, and he would not have taken in so much water."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said, "If I had tried to save him earlier, he would have been struggling for his life and would have grabbed on to anything he could have gotten hold of, and both of us would have drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is a secret to saving a drowning man: Do not save anyone who is living and do not save anyone who is dead; only save those who are half dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not save the dead because it is hopeless to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not save the living, because they are still kicking with their strength.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you approach them, they will hold on to you and neither they nor you will be able to swim, and both will drown.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why you should save only those who are half dead, those whom you can grab hold of, but who cannot grab hold of you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, you will be safe, and they will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are like the man who was drowning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God will only save us after we have exhausted all of our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the problem is that men often try to make it when they know very well that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We pray, make resolutions, and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This makes it impossible for God to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must be like the drowning man who had exhausted all of his strength in struggling and striving; then God will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are still kicking with our arms and legs and still making up our minds and struggling, we are still trying to make it and are not yet depleted of our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God will wait and not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He will wait until we give up trying to save ourselves, and then He will step forward to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, we must not only be clear that we cannot make it, but must also give up trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Satan loves to see us stepping forward to fight with him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once we step forward, he wins the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His trick is to induce us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As soon as we move, he wins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God has to wait until we drop both of our hands and have completely surrendered.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only then will we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the meaning of letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Letting go is dropping all of our ability and setting aside our own life completely.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By acknowledging that we cannot make it and by saying that we have no intention to try to make it, we will overcome.</S>
