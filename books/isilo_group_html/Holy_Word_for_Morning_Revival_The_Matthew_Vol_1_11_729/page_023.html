But if the salt has become <sup>2</sup>tasteless, with what shall it be salted?...</p><p class="bold">14 &nbsp;You are the <sup>1</sup>light of the world. It is impossible for a <sup>2</sup>city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.</p> <p>15 &nbsp;Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the <sup>1</sup>bushel, but on the <sup>2</sup>lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and <sup>1</sup>glorify your <sup>2</sup>Father who is in the heavens.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>13<sup>1</sup> Salt, by nature, is an element that kills and eliminates the germs of corruption. To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such an element, keeping the earth from being fully corrupted.</p><p>13<sup>2</sup> For the kingdom people to become tasteless means that they lose their salting function. They become the same as the earthly people and are indistinguishable from the unbelievers.</p><p>14<sup>1</sup> Light is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness. To the darkened world the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light, effacing the world&#8217;s darkness. In nature they are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.</p><p>14<sup>2</sup> As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain, a city that cannot be hidden. This will ultimately consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11, 23-24).</p><p>15<sup>1</sup> A bushel is an instrument for measuring grain. A lighted lamp placed under a bushel cannot shine out its light. The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by a bushel, an item pertaining to food, concern for which causes people to be anxious (6:25).</p><p>15<sup>2</sup> The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As a city on a mountain, the light cannot be hidden, and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give the glory to God.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> The title your Father proves that the disciples, who were the new King&#8217;s audience, were regenerated children of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:6).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>[Now] we come to the second section of the decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution (5:13-16), which concerns the influence of the people of the kingdom of the heavens upon the world....Do not consider the influence of the kingdom people upon the world an individual matter....All individualistic spirituality is a cancer that absorbs into itself the nourishment intended for the whole Body. Cancer is not caused by germs; it is caused by cells in the body that separate from the body and care only for themselves....We all need to hear this word of warning.</p><p>We need to be impressed with the fact it is as a corporate entity that the kingdom people are salt and light. If we separate ourselves from the church life, we can no longer be salt or light....Today the church people are the kingdom people. Concerning discipline and exercise, we are the kingdom people. But concerning life and grace, we are the church people.</p><p>In verse 13 the Lord speaks of the earth, and in verse 14 He speaks of the world. [These] terms are not synonymous. What was created by God is the earth, and what came in through the corruption of Satan is the world. To the God-created earth, the kingdom people are salt. But to the Satan-corrupted world, they are light. We are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
