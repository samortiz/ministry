We pray that You will release Yourself more and more so that we may be satisfied, and Your Body may be built up
Not to mention the Body of Christ, just our little body is extremely mysterious; its mystery lies in its being organic
In this first message tonight we will see the history of the Body of Christ, or the origin of the Body of Christ
We have two births; one was our physical birth from our parents; the other was our spiritual birth from God our Father
According to the flesh, we are the children of our parents; hence, we have last names like Cheng, Lee, or Wang
In time, at the right moment, God the Spirit, following the changes in the world situation and the environmental arrangement, sanctified us
There God the Spirit is likened to a woman lighting a lamp and sweeping the house to finely seek after the lost coin
Through His Spirit He has sanctified us and regenerated us that we might become the sons of God, the members of Christ
Being absent from the meetings may be somewhat risky; if you are not careful, you may soon be disconnected from the Body
The real significance is that we have become the members of the Body of Christ, possessing the same one life and needing one another
While it is true that we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit, according to the truth, it is God the Son who has become our life
According to the clear word and revelation of the Bible, when the Holy Spirit regenerated us, He brought Christ to us
At the same time, this life causes us to have an organic union with the Triune God so that we can enjoy all the riches of the Triune God
The meeting hall receives all the benefits of the power plant, by which we enjoy air conditioning, lights, the sound system, and so on
Today's modern living depends especially on the union between the power plant and every place that electricity is applied
We have all been regenerated, Christ has become our life within, and this life causes us to have a union with the Triune God
Inwardly, we were regenerated to have life; outwardly, the Spirit was poured upon us so that we might be baptized into one Body
It was not until the Lord Jesus was resurrected from the dead and realized as the Spirit that the Spirit was completed
Long before time began, in eternity past before all things were created, God by His eternal foreknowledge selected us and also marked us out
All the people along the lower Yangtze River in China like to drink tea in the morning to fill their stomachs with water
To drink the Spirit is to wrap the 'water' with 'skin'; to be baptized into the one Body is to wrap 'skin' with the 'water'
There is the Spirit within, regenerating, transforming, and supplying us with life; this is the essential Spirit
Lord, may You gain the glory, may we receive the blessing, may the evil one get the shame, and may the church be built up
Those who study chemistry know that chemistry is mainly the study of the constituents of matter, and the constituents are the elements
In pharmaceutics certain drugs are produced by extracting particular essences from herbs which in turn give the drugs their special effects
The church as the Body of Christ also has its own elements or constituents, within which are their essences and substance
We are not required to work out a kind of holiness; rather, it is the holy God Himself who works holiness into our being through His Spirit
If there is holiness, He is holiness; if there is light, He is light; if there is life, He is life; and if there is patience, He is patience
Now that we have acquired a clear impression concerning element, essence, and reality, we can apply all three to the Body of Christ
One is the processed Triune God, which is the divine element; the other is the tripartite man regenerated by God, which is the human element
The constituent of the processed Triune God enters into us to mingle with us, the tripartite man, to produce the Body of Christ
We realize that although the church and a social club are both human gatherings, there is a great difference between them
A single constituent is not enough; there must be both the divine constituent as well as the human constituent
Besides having the human element with its human essence, the church also possesses the divine element with its divine essence
Now we will follow the outline to get into this present message which is entitled The Elements Essence and Reality of the Body of Christ
The church is different from all organizations because it possesses the divine element of the processed Triune God
He also resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit so that He might get into all who believe in Him and call upon Him
Before we were saved and had the divine life and divine constituent in us, we frequently quarreled with our spouse
The second item of the elements of the Body of Christ is the tripartite man regenerated by God as the human element
The processed Triune God is the divine constituent, and the tripartite being who has been possessed by God is the human constituent
Divinity being begotten in humanity, living in humanity, and being expressed in humanity refers to the Lord Jesus as God incarnate
Further the Spirit through regeneration has brought the processed Triune God into the Body of Christ that is into us the regenerated persons
Both the element and essence of the Body of Christ are this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
The Spirit, who is in the Body of Christ, is the Body's element on the one hand and its essence on the other hand
Another example is the various types of antibiotics with their different constituents and element and thus their different essences
The essence of the Body of Christ contains the divinity of the Triune God with the capacity to supply the divine life
The Spirit as the essence of the Triune God becoming the essence of the Body of Christ is able to supply God's life and nature into us
The essence of the Body of Christ contains the excelling humanity with the capacity to supply the same excelling humanity to us
After the Lord received the five loaves and two fishes from the disciples, He ordered the people to sit down in rows
After the crowd ate and was full, He charged the disciples to gather the leftovers, which eventually filled twelve baskets
We can see that while the Lord richly supplied the people in His rich divinity, He did not waste anything but cherished what God had blessed
The essence of the Body of Christ contains the all-inclusive death of Christ, with the capacity to put to death the negative things
Just as antibiotics possess germ-killing essences, the all-inclusive death of Christ is able to kill all the negative things in us
The redemption accomplished by Christ through His cross two thousand years ago can now be applied to us through His eternal Spirit
The essence of the Body of Christ also contains the surpassing resurrection of Christ with the surpassing capacity of resurrection
The Body of Christ is the church today, and all of its reality is the Spirit of the reality of the consummated Triune God
The church therefore possesses the reality of the divine attributes, such as righteousness, holiness, life, light, power, and grace
When the Spirit of reality came, He made these experiences of the Triune God real in us as our real experiences
We do not lose our temper, nor do we blame or rebuke others, because the death of Christ is realized in us through the Spirit of reality
It is the Spirit of reality who makes God's love real in the Body of Christ, so that it may be sanctified and strengthened
Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection all have their effectiveness, and their effectiveness is just the Spirit of essence and reality
The effectiveness of both the death and resurrection of Christ is displayed in us who possess this Spirit of essence and reality
Do not place your mind on frivolous matters; set it on the spirit by turning your entire being to this joined spirit
When we live in this joined spirit, we will be able to live out the Body of Christ and become His corporate expression
We all know that the living of human beings, birds, beasts, or cattle is according to the element and essence of its life
Every saved person has been born of the Spirit and has obtained the Spirit, who is the essence and reality of the Body of Christ
We have a glorious hope because within us we have the Spirit, who is the essence and reality of the Triune God, saturating us continuously
The Spirit is the essence of this Body as something within; He is also the reality of this Body as something without
Originally we were all in Adam; our element was the element of Adam, the element of death, not the element of life
When we believed in the Lord and were baptized into water, our old man was buried and the element which came from Adam was terminated
When we believed and were baptized, we came out of Adam; at the same time, we entered into Christ and were united to Christ
If there is no element of Christ in the church, but only the element of Adam, it is still not the organic Body of Christ
We must accept the dealing of the cross to deal with our old man and naturalness; we should let Adam go and let Christ come out
If we would live the life of the Body of Christ, we need to be in resurrection by the Spirit and through the cross
The principle of the living in the Body of Christ is life, not behavior; and it is corporate, not individualistic
The combination of all these four aspects of relationship is the living in the Body of Christ, the Christian life, and also the church life
The living in the Body of Christ has its basic element, intrinsic essence, extrinsic reality, and also its regulation and principle
If one is endeavoring yet does not center on himself, but on the goal of his endeavoring, he will benefit society and the country
For us Christians, our Head is Christ, our content is Christ, our principal object and center are also Christ, and even our goal is Christ
The essence and the reality are related to the intrinsic nature and the outward condition of the Body of Christ
There is an essence within us Christians, and the reality we manifest without should be the living out of this essence
If we are not like this, we are 'low-grade' Christians, lacking the intrinsic essence and the outward condition
He is within us as our essence, saturating us so that there is the manifestation without as the reality of our Christian life
The Spirit, who is our inward essence and outward reality, is also the secret and effectiveness of our practice of the Body life
Some get divorced simply because they do not have the skill to conduct themselves and they do not know the technique of being a human being
If we are in our spirit we would know how to speak and how to handle the situations and in most cases this could calm the wind and the waves
If we can take the Spirit as the secret of our living, our behavior will be skillful, and we will not have arguments or discord
For this reason, in the living of the Body of Christ we need to take the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ as the regulation
If we go along with His operation, His resurrection power will come and cause us to be transcendent and victorious
Our co-crucifixion with Christ should also be our moment-by-moment experience; this is enjoyed through the effectiveness of the Spirit
On the other hand, according to the New Testament revelation, our co-resurrection with Christ is also an accomplished fact
We have already mentioned that in the living of every kind of life there is its definite regulation and principle
We should accept the regulation of the Body of Christ in order to live out the life that has the Body of Christ as the principle
Among the two thousand attendants, over thirteen hundred people were saved within the past year in different towns and villages
For the past fifteen months, since January a year ago, our brothers and sisters have gone to the countryside with a commission
They did not look like new believers, but like professionals who knew how to sing, smile, and express themselves
If we as the members of Christ can neither laugh or weep, jump or shout, it is difficult for our service to be effectual
You all must learn to do the Lord's work by special assignment so that you can fulfill your service in the Body
You can preach the gospel to your classmates while playing ball with them, and you can feed the lambs over the telephone
The foremost thing of this service is to center on the preaching of the gospel to save sinners and to offer them as sacrifices to God
Our gospel preaching today is not merely to win souls but to save sinners one by one and offer them as sacrifices to God
The service of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel has as its goal the building up of the Body of Christ
The focus of our service is to save sinners and offer them to God, while the goal is to build up the Body of Christ
They are being offered to God as sacrifices, and they have all become materials for the building up of the Body of Christ
Through Him, we can deal with and be brought through all the hindrances and problems that we encounter in our service
In the service of the Body of Christ we not only take Christ as Lord but also take the Holy Spirit as power and authority
We must consider it a fact that the Christ who was transfigured as the Holy Spirit is with us when we go to preach the gospel
Do not speak by the natural man outwardly, but rather speak by an inward exercise of the power and authority given by the Holy Spirit
The big gospel meetings of the past were good except for one shortcoming: only one spoke and not all could function
You can begin by calling up your relatives, acquaintances, colleagues, or classmates and talking with them on the phone
In most big corporations today, tasks are spread out among many people and not concentrated in the hands of a few
Modern business administration seeks to abandon this principle in favor of division of labor and mutual cooperation
If we had relied only on a few speakers, the number we would gain in a few years would probably be quite small
Rather, they should set apart two years of their time for church service by serving the Lord on a full-time basis
In the past practice of the new way we have stressed only door-to-door visitation for gospel preaching and not telephoning or letter writing
At the same time we need to hold reaping meetings at least once a month so that our gospel can be preached more thoroughly and completely
The gifted ones should not be the only ones who perfect the saints; the saints themselves should become gifted ones to perfect others
In addition to the joints there is the need for another group of members such as the hands and fingers with their own particular functions
Lastly, the gifted ones still need to labor and struggle in all wisdom to present every saint full-grown in Christ to God
At this point, the saints will have become full-grown in the stature of Christ, and the Body of Christ can be fully built
May the Lord give grace to each of you, and may each one of you receive these words and practice them diligently by His grace
