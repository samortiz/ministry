 <h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE SEVEN EYES OF GOD</h2>
<p>The One who is making us jasper is the jasper One on the throne. God&rsquo;s throne is His reigning, and out of His sovereign reigning comes forth fire (Rev. 4:5). The fire that comes out of His reigning, however, is not a consuming fire but lamps of fire to enlighten us. If God were merely a consuming fire, He would be fearful. However, since He is the lamps of fire, He is not fearful to us. We are always safe before a lamp. Moreover, the Lamb, Christ, who passed through death and resurrection has eyes that transfuse God and convey His feelings. One glance, or even one rebuke, from His eyes is full of feelings. The organs which most express a person&rsquo;s feelings are his eyes.</p>
<p>Christ came forth from the throne of God, which represents His sovereignty and reigning, as a consuming fire. But after passing through death and resurrection, He became lamps and eyes. Because of this, when we taste the visitation and grace of God, our first inner feeling is that God&rsquo;s eyes are looking at our inner being. Every time we come near to God in order to meet God, taking the precious blood of the Lamb who was slain, the God in heaven is not like thunder and lightning or a burning fire to us; instead, He is like eyes that look into our inner being. Every day when we come near to God in the Lamb who was slain, we have fellowship with God, and inwardly our first feeling is that God&rsquo;s eyes are looking into our inner being.</p>
<p>These eyes are also the Spirit of God. Every time we have fellowship with God, His eyes look at our inner being, for these eyes are sent forth into all the earth. Whenever we come near to God, this is our first experience. Our second experience is that we sense that God is enlightening us inwardly. The eyes are lamps of fire to enlighten us, causing us to know immediately that we are wrong in certain matters and to feel that we should deal with and resolve certain matters. First, the eyes look at us, and the result of this looking is the shining. Then the result of this shining is the burning of fire. The burning of fire, on the one hand, deals with everything that should not exist and, on the other hand, motivates us inwardly.</p>
<p>Through this kind of burning, we who were made of clay will become jasper. After one experience of the burning, we have more of the appearance of jasper; after another experience of the burning, we have the addition of the element of God; after another experience of the burning, we have more of the color of God; and after yet another experience of the burning, the appearance of God emerges. In one burning after another the eyes look at us, the lamps shine into us, and the burning comes to us. Through these experiences, we will have more of the appearance of God, and in our living we will have more of the expression of God in appearance and image.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2>
<p>God who is sitting on the throne is a consuming fire and Spirit, and what comes out of Him is consuming fire, lamps of fire, the seven Spirits, and the eyes. When He looks at a person and shines into him, He burns in him, and the result is precious stone. How much appearance, radiance, and color of God can a man of clay have? Through the work of the Holy Spirit, a man of clay can be burned to the extent that he becomes part of the New Jerusalem. When this happens, this redeemed one will not only have entered the pearl gate and have the element of pure gold but will also have the issue of the burning of the Holy Spirit&mdash;the wall constituted with the Holy Spirit. This wall bears the appearance of God and is a separating boundary. Whenever we see this wall in a person, we see God&rsquo;s radiance, God&rsquo;s image, and a clear separating boundary.</p>
<p>This separating line discerns between what is heavenly and what is earthly, what is spiritual and what is fleshly, what is of God and what is of man, and what is holy and what is common. This discernment comes from the constitution of the Holy Spirit and is produced by the burning of the Holy Spirit. It is by this discernment that the image of separation and the radiance of the Holy Spirit are expressed. The result is the reality of the Holy Spirit, which is spiritual reality.</p>
