The Trial on the Whole Inhabited Earth<br />Is Coming</h2><p>Another aspect of the need for the rapture of the overcomers is that the trial is coming on the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10). This trial will be the great tribulation, consisting of the three woes of the last three trumpets probably with the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets. Those woes and calamities will be the most severe trial to the earth&rsquo;s dwellers. To be saved from this trial, we need to be raptured before it comes.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Destruction as the Birth-pang<br />on the Peace-and-Safety Talkers Is Coming</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:3 says, &ldquo;Whenever they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they shall by no means escape.&rdquo; This verse indicates that destruction will come as birth pangs upon those who talk of peace and safety. Those in the United Nations take the words <i>peace</i> and <i>safety</i> as a slogan. While people are talking about peace and safety, sudden destruction will come upon them.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Devil Coming down to Earth with<br />Great Wrath as a Woe to the Earth and the Sea</h2><p>Another aspect of the need for the rapture of the overcomers is that the Devil will come down to earth with great wrath as a woe to the earth and to the sea (Rev. 12:12). By then, he will know that his time is short and thus he will do everything possible to torment man to the uttermost. We surely need a rapture to keep us away from his evil torment.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Great Dragon&mdash;Satan&mdash;Being Angry<br />with the Woman and Going to War<br />with the Remnant of Her Seed</h2><p>After the great dragon, Satan, has come down to earth, he will be angry with the woman and will go to war with the remnant of her seed (12:17). The woman in chapter twelve is the totality of God&rsquo;s people, including both the church and the children of Israel. Her children are of two categories: those who keep the law and those who have the testimony of Jesus. The one hundred and forty-four thousand chosen remnant of Israel will certainly be faithful to the law, and the redeemed ones, the believers, will be faithful to the testimony of Jesus. The great dragon, who will be angry with this woman, will war with the remnant of her seed, with the Jews who keep the law of Moses and the Christians who have the testimony of Jesus. An early rapture is needed before this.</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Beast&mdash;Antichrist&mdash;Warring<br />with the Saints and Overcoming Them</h2><p>Speaking of Antichrist, Revelation 13:7 says, &ldquo;And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.&rdquo; The saints are God&rsquo;s people as signified by the woman in chapter twelve. This indicates that in the great tribulation a number of believers, against whom Antichrist will war and whom he will overcome, will still be there. This means that he will persecute the believers during the great tribulation. How much we need a rapture before that time!</p><p>Because all these terrible, horrible things are coming, there is the need for us to be taken away. We are not waiting for these dreadful events to take place. We are waiting for the Lord to take us away before any of these things come to pass. Thus, there is definitely the need for the rapture of the overcomers.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Promises</h2><h2 class="head3">1. To Be Accounted Worthy to Escape All<br />These Things and to Stand before the Son of Man</h2><p>Now we come to the promises with respect to the rapture of the overcomers. Luke 21:36 says, &ldquo;But be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo; According to the Greek, the words <i>be accounted worthy</i> may be rendered &ldquo;fully strengthened.&rdquo; In Greek this phrase has both meanings. When we are fully strengthened, we are counted worthy. We must be fully strengthened in order to escape the snare and to stand before the Son of Man. Before the Lord comes back, He, the Son of Man, will be in the third heaven. Luke 21:36 reveals that the overcomers will stand before the Son of Man. This means that they will be raptured to the presence of the Lord in the heavens. While the snare is about to come, we must be fully strengthened to escape it. If you are familiar with fishing, you will realize that some stronger fish are able to escape the net. Likewise, the overcomers will be fully strengthened to escape the snare and to stand in the presence of the Lord in the heavens. This is a promise of being raptured before the great tribulation.</p> <h2 class="head3">2. To Be Kept out of the Hour of Trial</h2><p>Another promise regarding the rapture is found in Revelation 3:10. &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; Some say that all Christians will be raptured after the tribulation. This concept is found among the so-called Newton group of the Brethren which separated from Darby&rsquo;s group. The Newton group teaches that all Christians will pass through the tribulation. Once I asked one of the leading teachers in the Newton group about Revelation 3:10, and he admitted that this verse was a problem to them. According to this verse, the overcomers will not only be kept out of the trial but also out of the hour of the trial, meaning that they will be raptured before the great tribulation. Hence, the rapture of the overcomers will precede the great tribulation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> </body></html>
