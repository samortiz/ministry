<p>Next, we must fellowship with the Lord by drawing near to Him every morning and by reading the Bible and praying daily. As Christians, we must absorb the Lord through reading the Bible, praying, drawing near to Him, and enjoying Him. This is not a matter of doctrine but a matter of practice. Some believers have been saved for many years, but they still do not know how to fellowship with the Lord, nor do they know the key to fellowshipping with the Lord. They are thus unable to touch the Lord or enjoy Him. Such Christians are not normal Christians. Persons who do not eat or drink cannot be healthy, and those who are malnourished are susceptible to all kinds of sicknesses. Christians can also be sick if they are spiritually malnourished.</p>
<p>In order to fellowship with the Lord, we must know that He is omnipresent. The Bible says that &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17). He is the Spirit indwelling our spirit; therefore, we can fellowship with Him at any time. The Lord is also the Word. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63), and in Romans Paul says, &ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; (10:8). If we contact the Lord&rsquo;s word by reading the Bible, we will be able to contact the Lord. However, we must take heed to read the Bible not only with our eyes or our mind but to contact the words of the Bible with our spirit. This is the way to receive the Lord as our supply from His Word.</p>
<p>We must also pray after reading the Bible. When we pray according to our spirit, we will be able to contact the Lord in our spirit. If we will spend ten to thirty minutes reading the Bible and praying every morning, we will be supplied inwardly by the Lord. In our fellowship with the Lord, He may shine in us, rebuke us, comfort us, or encourage us. No matter what we experience, we gain the Lord. To gain the Lord is to be fed within. It is best to do this not only in the morning but also to find quiet time to fellowship with the Lord in the afternoon and in the evening before going to bed. The Lord is our true food, true drink, true sunlight, and true air. If we eat Him, drink Him, breathe Him, and accept His shining, our spirit will be strong.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some Christians do not know how to have genuine contact with the Lord. Hence, they have a nominal Christian life and are merely religious. They know only doctrines; they do not know how to use their spirit, nor do they know about using their spirit. As a result, they are often deflated spiritually. Because they do not fellowship with the Lord, they are also indifferent to their mistakes and their coldness. If we are genuinely saved, we must learn the way to fellowship with the Lord, to contact Him, to read His Word, to pray to Him often in spirit, and to be supplied by Him. Then we will accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealings and experience His demands, restrictions, limitations, and breaking. The more we have such experiences, the better.</p>
<p>We should bring what we sense to the Lord in prayer. As soon as we have a sense, we should pray. To pray much is to let the divine air flow more through us, to penetrate us further, and to flow deeper within us. Such prayer can be compared to deep breathing and will refresh us and make our spirit healthy and strong. Sometimes we may further experience being led in prayer, and we may also experience the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit. We will also have a burden for the gospel and the spirit of the gospel when our spirit is open. When we are enlivened within, we will be living and full of the Spirit, instead of being deflated while preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>I hope that all the saints will make a resolution to pursue knowing the Lord and to fellowship with Him. Fellowshipping with the Lord includes many things, such as drawing near to Him, reading the Bible, and praying in the morning. How can the Lord bless us if we do not read the Bible, pray, or rise up early to draw near to Him? If some do not have the time in the morning, they can be flexible and use other times. However, the morning is the most suitable time. The saints in Los Angeles are an example. Both the younger and the older saints do their best to come together for morning revival at six o&rsquo;clock. Some wake up before five o&rsquo;clock and drive an hour to join the morning revival. It is good for individuals to rise up early and draw near to the Lord, and it is more helpful for several to draw near to the Lord together. We all need to pay some price. We will lose the blessing when we are at ease. It is important for us to pay the price of rising up early by sacrificing some sleep so that we may enjoy the Lord in morning revival. In our morning revival we should read the Bible and pray, but we should not read for too long. The important thing is to absorb the Lord, pray much, and fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>The saints who live close to one another should daily practice to rise early in order to read the Bible, to pray, and to enjoy the Lord together. It is not easy to open up to others, because of our human nature. Our natural life is closed and wants to do everything on its own. We should have personal prayer, but there are many things in which we cannot get through with personal prayers. These things require that we pray with the brothers and sisters in order to get through. Hence, we must learn to be open persons, to open to the brothers and sisters, and to read the Bible, pray, and pursue the Lord together with others. Those who keep themselves closed cannot fellowship with the saints, and as a result, it is not easy for them to receive grace and grow. If we are open for fellowship with others, they will remember our problems in prayer.</p>
<p>The prayer of two or three gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name has the most authority. The Lord said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (Matt. 18:19-20). The Lord also said &ldquo;Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven&rdquo; (v. 18). Personal prayer does not have such authority. In any matter the strength of an individual is much smaller than the strength of many. This also applies to prayer; the prayer of several people together is very effectual. If we can practice this, it will afford much growth to the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
