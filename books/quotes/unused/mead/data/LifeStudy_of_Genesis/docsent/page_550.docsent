   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the end of verse 40 Paul said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The little word "also" here means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul seemed to be saying, "I not only have my opinion; I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Notice that Paul did not say, "I have the assurance," or "I believe"; rather, he said, "I think."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that he was not certain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he did not have the assurance that he had the Spirit of God, we all recognize chapter seven of 1 Corinthians as the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, as I was listening to Brother Nee that day in 1940, I agreed with his word that 1 Corinthians 7 records the peak of Paul's Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul's opinion was God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In principle, it is the same with Jacob in Genesis 49.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever Jacob uttered in this chapter was God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although it was his opinion, it was also the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 49:3 and 4 Jacob seemed to be saying, "Reuben, you are my firstborn; however, because you have been defiled, you cannot enjoy the preeminence of having the birthright."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob's word to Reuben was somewhat of a prediction, for it concerned the loss of the birthright; it was also somewhat of a curse, for it pointed out that Reuben was to be bereft of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was not the speaking of a young man nor even of an ordinary human being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was the utterance of a man who was filled with God, a man who had been constituted with God in his entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of chapter forty-nine, Jacob was a God-man, a man filled, constituted, permeated, and even reorganized with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, whatever he spoke was God's word; whatever he thought was God's thought; and whatever opinion he expressed was God's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither a young person nor a middle-aged person can speak this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It can only be uttered by one who has come to full maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob's speaking in this chapter reveals that he had fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My burden in this message is to impress you all, especially the young people, with this fact that your speaking exposes where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have a lot to say when you lose your socks, that should remind you of your immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of reaction makes evident your need for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Forget that pair of socks and seek to gain more life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have to say something, you should say, "I need more life."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not say, "Where are my socks?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, say, "Brothers, do you know where my growth in life is?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever a brother asks about his socks, the others should say, "Here is your growth in life."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of us are talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were born this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is our nature, disposition, and characteristic to be talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you are talkative you should be reminded that your talkativeness is a sign that you need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4 Jacob, the Father in the Flesh,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and Israel, God's Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 49:2 says, "Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse is in the form of Hebrew poetry, which is always written in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first part of the pair in verse 2 is, "Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob," and the second part is, "And hearken unto Israel your father."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The begetting father was Jacob, and the speaking father was Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All twelve sons were born of Jacob, the father in the flesh, a supplanter, a heel-holder, and a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the blessing and prophesying father was no longer a Jacob; he was Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In his natural being, Jacob could never have uttered such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was only because of his maturity that he was able to speak this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jacob did not say to his sons, "Hearken unto Jacob your father"; he said, "Hearken unto Israel your father."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Israel was not only a transformed person, but also one matured in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all would enjoy hearing testimonies from those who were Jacobs many years ago but who are now Israels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need more Israels, those who speak not only for God, but also with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever they say is God's utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis 49 Israel was fully permeated, saturated, constituted, and reorganized with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because he was one with God, whatever he spoke was the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in this chapter we have a prophecy that is permeated with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 28 says, "All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this a prophecy or a blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although it is a prophecy, it is prophecy filled with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Jacob in chapter forty-nine is spiritually and divinely knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He knows God, and he knows the situations of his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, he has the necessary riches with which to prophesy and bless.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, he can speak a prophecy permeated with all manner of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In his speaking there is no error, opaqueness, darkness, emptiness, or vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, his speaking is a rich, deep, profound prophecy permeated with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is absolutely different from the "Thus saith the Lord" common among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In just a few minutes you may receive the gift to speak that kind of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it takes many years to grow to the stature where you can utter the kind of word spoken by Jacob in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not a matter of gift or function; it is a matter of growth and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be mature is to be constituted with God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All that God is must be constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every fiber of our being must be reorganized and permeated with the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When this has taken place, like Jacob, we shall be the kind of person who can prophesy with blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this maturity we are divinely knowledgeable, knowing thoroughly the things of God and the situations of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this maturity we also have the riches to speak a blessing prophecy.</S>
