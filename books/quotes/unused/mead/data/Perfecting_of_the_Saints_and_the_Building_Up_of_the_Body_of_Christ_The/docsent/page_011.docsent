   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING INTO THE HEAD Holding to Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 says, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today, if we want to build up the Body of Christ, we must love God, Christ, and the church in the love with which God loves us and in the love which He put within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this we can hold to the truth in this love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the words of Solomon, everything under the sun is vanity; there is no reality Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there is One who is real in the universe, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God occupies the proper position in everything, then everything is true.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, all things are but vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Romans 3:4 says, every man is a liar; only God is true.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this true God there are three things: the economy of God, the Christ of God, and the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the whole universe only this group of things is true.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you take them away from the universe, the universe will become vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, when you hear some rumors in the church, you should compare them with these words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do they conform to God s economy, to the all-inclusive Christ, and to the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they do not conform to these three things, you should let these rumors go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, you will be holding to truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Love in the Element and Sphere</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>of the Divine Love</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Love is not just an element; it is also a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Element refers to the inward constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The constituent in the love of God is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This constituent of love is in us, and we hold to truth in this constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This love is also a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this love and by this love, we are able to hold to truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Holding to God s New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we hold to truth, the first item to hold to is God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s economy is His dispensation of the mystery hidden in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is full within with an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is full of a plan and purpose, and He made arrangements accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In short, He arranged to create the heavens and the earth and to create man according to His image and likeness that man would be like Him, be His vessel, and be prepared for the day when the Creator God would enter into man to be mingled with man, to become the many members of Christ, and to constitute the Body of Christ to express Christ, which is to express the Triune God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the dispensation of the mystery hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the first item that we have to hold to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Holding to the All-inclusive Christ</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, we have to hold to the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Christ is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not only in all but also fills all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The universe is immeasurable, and Paul compared the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe to the measure of Christ Eph 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows us that the measure and riches of Christ are unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No doubt when Paul wrote the book of Ephesians he saw a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That is why he used the highest expressions such as the breadth and length and height and depth 3:18 and the unsearchable riches of Christ 3:8 to describe Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Holding to the Church</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, we have to hold to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is the Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the church is not an organization, but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reason why our body is so wonderful is that it is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the organs of our body, such as the teeth, the nose, and the ears are all grown from our body and are part of our body; they are not installed there by addition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is constituted by those who are regenerated, saved, and have received Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man does not have Christ in him, even if he is baptized ten thousand times, he is still not a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because the church is completely organic.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the genuine members are grown into the church; they are not added in by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to hold to this organism and not to any organized congregation.</S>
