   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JAMES AND GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The writing of James is very much involved with the matter of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But his view was not clear concerning God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By dispensation here we mean God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Economy is an anglicized form of the Greek oikonomia, a word that means household arrangement and refers to God s management.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James was born of Mary, who was also the mother of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read Mary s praise recorded in chapter two of the Gospel of Luke, you will see that it contains many quotations from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that Mary was very godly, much like the parents of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a godly person, Mary was knowledgeable concerning God s word in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James, therefore, was raised by a godly mother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt, Mary s godliness was in the Old Testament dispensation, and certainly she taught her children to be godly in this Old Testament way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Mary may never have seen God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, James believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This, no doubt, was a great turn for him to make.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But before James believed in the Lord, he may already have been godly in an Old Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may compare this James with Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John and James were brothers and also cousins to the James who wrote this Epistle, for their mother was a sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus and this James.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Like Peter, John and James were uncultured Galilean fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus even called the brothers James and John sons of thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the Lord s resurrection, this James became one of the apostles Gal 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, he became the leading elder in the church at Jerusalem Acts 12:17; 15:2, 13; 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By comparison, James may have been more godly and cultured than Peter, John, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knew the Old Testament, probably the book of Proverbs especially, very well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those in Jerusalem regarded James highly, and he became the most influential person among the believers there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fact that James was the most influential believer in Jerusalem is proved by what is recorded in Galatians 2:11 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see that before certain ones came from James, Peter ate with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul does not say that they came from Jerusalem, but that they came from James .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the ones came from James, Peter was afraid, shrank back, and separated himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that even Peter was afraid of James and also proves that James was the top influence in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapter fifteen of Acts also proves that the influence of James was prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, in Acts 21 we are told that when Paul went the last time to Jerusalem, he went to see James.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 21 does not say that Paul went to the elders, but that he went to James, where all the elders were assembled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>James, therefore, was the center of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was prevailing, and the entire situation was under his influence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Acts 21 we can see what James influence was.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>James pointed out to Paul that in Jerusalem tens of thousands believed in the Lord Jesus and were zealous for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, James encouraged Paul to go to the temple with certain men who had a vow on them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>James word in Acts 21 gives us a view of the intrinsic contents of his writing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>James definitely believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Several points in his Epistle prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, James says that we have been begotten by the Father of lights by the word of truth 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is New Testament regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>James also speaks of receiving with meekness the implanted word 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This also is a New Testament matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then James goes on to speak of the perfect law, the law of freedom 1:25 , and of the indwelling Spirit 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chapter five he refers to the church when he mentions the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition, in 2:1 James speaks of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, along with these positive matters concerning God s New Testament economy, James brings in things of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, he speaks of the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also indicates that for him keeping the perfect law is a matter of visiting orphans and widows.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This word is full of the Old Testament flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>James does not speak of living Christ, of walking in the Spirit, or of having a life for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, his illustrations are from the Old Testament or have an Old Testament flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even James way of praying is according to Elijah s way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>James charges the elders to pray for the sick according to the way Elijah prayed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a similar way, he charges us to wait for the Lord s coming back in a way that is similar to Job s endurance and to the longsuffering of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Again, both examples are drawn from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, what we have in the Epistle of James is a mixture of the things of the Old Testament with God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we have all the Life-study messages on the writings of Paul and although we may have seen the central focus of the divine revelation in the New Testament, we still may be in a cloudy atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may think that to have good character means that we are godly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may also have a natural understanding or religious understanding of what godliness is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our view of godliness may not be according to the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once again we see the need for a clear vision of God s New Testament economy.</S>
