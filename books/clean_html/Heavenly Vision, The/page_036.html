<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BURNING THE BRIDGES BEHIND US</H2><P>If you pay the price for the heavenly vision, you will "burn the bridges" behind you and will have no way to go backward. Christianity will be behind you, and you will have no way to return to it. Even if you wanted to go back, the people would not accept you.</P><P>However, suppose that one day an offer is presented to you, an opportunity to have a better position or a better future. The opportunity may be for you, or it may be for your wife or children. Would you consider this offer? For you to consider such an offer would mean that you have not burned all the bridges. It would mean that you have left yourself a way to go back. By the Lord's mercy I can testify that I burned all my bridges more than thirty years ago. We should not be ashamed of burning our bridges&#151;we should praise the Lord for it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COST OF TAKING THE WAY<br>OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>To take the way of the Lord's recovery is not cheap. This way is expensive; it requires a costly consecration. To take this way will be at the cost of the religion of your fathers and of your country, at the cost of your relationships with your neighbors and of your relatives, and at the cost of your own life. Are you ready for such a consecration? Are you ready to come in the upper room to be clear concerning the heavenly vision?</P><P>We are here not for a movement but for the Lord's recovery. How can the recovery be realized? The recovery can be realized, carried out, only by the experience of the consecration in the upper room. This is not an ordinary consecration; it is a special consecration, a specific consecration, an extraordinary consecration. This consecration is a turning point.</P><P>What happened to those one hundred and twenty who were in the upper room in Acts 1? They all became a burnt offering. They were burning and they burned others. We also need to be burned, and then we will burn others.</P><P>What are you expecting today? Do you expect a revival or a movement? Do you expect a new kind of Christian activity? What are we doing here? Have we come together to hear something that we cannot hear elsewhere? We may be here for this reason, but this is not enough. We must be here for the Lord's recovery, which is the issue of an upper-room consecration.</P>
