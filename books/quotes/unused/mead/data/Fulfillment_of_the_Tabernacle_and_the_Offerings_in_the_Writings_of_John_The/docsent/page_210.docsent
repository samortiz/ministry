   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the beginning of the crucifixion, the Lord was offered wine to drink mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But after He tasted it, He refused to drink it Matt 27:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This wine mingled with gall and also with myrrh Mark 15:23 was intended to be a stupefying draught.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord, however, would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was willing to suffer the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at the end of His crucifixion, when His work was finished, He said that He was thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they mockingly served Him vinegar, He took it and then said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's word, "It is finished!" signifies that as the Lord Jesus was dying, He was working.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For what was the Lord working in His death?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the cross He was working for three things: first, to accomplish redemption; second, to terminate the old creation; and third, to release His divine life so that by this life the new creation could be brought forth for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was necessary for sin and sins to be taken away, for the old creation to be terminated, and for the divine life to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only through the release of the divine life would the new creation have a way to be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Redemption, termination, and the release of life all depended on the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, while the Lord was dying, He was working to accomplish these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was a seeking Christian for many years before I realized that the Lord Jesus was working while He was dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day I began to see that the hour of the Lord's death was an hour for Him to work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through this work He accomplished redemption, He terminated the old creation, and He released the divine life to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament there are definite hints concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapters eighteen and nineteen of John we see that the Lord Jesus was not afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through His death He accomplished a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The work accomplished through the Lord's death was much greater than the creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be sure, the new creation is greater and more important than the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to produce the old creation, it was only necessary for God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God desired a certain thing to come into existence, He simply spoke the word, and that thing came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The new creation, however, was not brought forth in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new creation was produced through the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was not produced by the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be impressed with the difference between the producing of the old creation and the producing of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the record of Genesis 1, everything in the old creation was created by God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God called things not being as being Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the old creation God spoke everything into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The new creation, on the contrary, was not created by God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new creation was produced through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through the working of the Lord in His death, the divine life within Him was released to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, as the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He did a marvelous work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, at the end He could declare, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This word means that the Lord's work in death was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During the years I was with the Brethren, they emphasized very much this word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In referring to the Lord's word, "It is finished," they emphasized that the Lord's redemptive work was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would never say that this understanding is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is certainly correct to apply this word to the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, this understanding is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Bible teachers have not gone on to point out that through His death the Lord's divine life was released from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, these teachers have not seen the imparting of the divine life into the Lord's believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen that there is an important difference between the Lord as the Lamb of God 1:29 and as the grain of wheat 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a grain of wheat, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died, not to accomplish redemption but to release the divine life so that this life may be imparted into us to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Lamb of God, the Lord died to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the death of the one grain of wheat is not for redemption; it is for reproduction, for propagation, through the release and impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's death has two main aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two aspects are signified by the blood and water that came out of the Lord's pierced side.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins Heb 9:22 for the purchase of the church Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Water is for imparting life, dealing with death John 12:24; 3:14-15 for the producing of the church Eph 5:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord's death, on the negative side, is to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The record of the other Gospels is for the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But John's record is not only for the redemptive aspect, but also for the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The life-imparting aspect of the Lord's death released the Lord's divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all those who believe in Him and to whom His divine life is imparted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have seen that this aspect of the Lord's death is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat, which fell into the ground to bring forth many grains for making the loaf the Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This, therefore, is the life-propagating, life-multiplying, generating, and reproducing death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most Christians, including many Christian teachers, see only one aspect of Christ's death, the redemptive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to see that the Lord's death has two aspects: the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life impartation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Redemption is a procedure, but the imparting of life is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we see only the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death, this means that we see the procedure but not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's death is not only for redemption, but also for life impartation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As the Lamb of God He died on the cross for our sins, and as the grain of wheat He died to release the divine life so that this life may be imparted into us to make us God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While the Lord was dying on the cross, He accomplished this wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then at the close of His crucifixion He could declare that this work was finished.</S>
