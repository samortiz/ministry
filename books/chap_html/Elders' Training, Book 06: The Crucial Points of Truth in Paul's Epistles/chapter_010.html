<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN HEBREWS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN INTRODUCTION TO HEBREWS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Speaking in Son</h2>
<p>The real subject of the book of Hebrews is God speaking in the Son. In other words, the whole book is the Son speaking God. God speaking in the Son means that the Son speaks God. The Son is the High Priest (8:1), and the aspect of the High Priest as the Son is speaking God. His being the Mediator of a better covenant speaks God (8:6). His being superior to the angels speaks God (1:4). His being superior to Moses (3:3), Joshua (4:8), and Aaron (5:4-6) speaks God. Whatever He is speaks God, and the entire book of Hebrews is the Son&rsquo;s speaking of God or God speaking in the Son.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in Son&rdquo; (lit.). &ldquo;In Son&rdquo; is the literal translation from the Greek text. No article between &ldquo;in&rdquo; and &ldquo;Son&rdquo; indicates that God and Son are not two separate Persons. God and Son are one. He is God but He speaks in Son. I am Witness Lee but when I speak, I speak &ldquo;in brother.&rdquo; Witness Lee and &ldquo;brother&rdquo; are one. It is not merely Witness Lee speaking, but Witness Lee &ldquo;in brother&rdquo; speaking. &ldquo;Witness Lee&rdquo; is not my qualification to speak. &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; is my qualification to speak. God, in the last days, spoke in Son. God did not speak anything merely as God, but He spoke everything in the New Testament in Son. This is why the Son is called the Word. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Word is for speaking. Eventually, His title is the Word of God in Revelation 19:13.</p>
<p>God speaks in Son and the Son speaks by what He is. Whatever He is is His speaking. He is Jesus. Jesus is His speaking. He is Christ. Christ is His speaking. He is a man, and this man is His speaking. He is a slave, and this slave is His speaking. He is a carpenter, and this carpenter is His speaking. He spoke Matthew 5, 6, and 7. He spoke John 14, 15, and 16, and spoke in His prayer in John 17. He spoke a lot by words, but He spoke even more by what He was. The entire four Gospels were His speaking, either by word directly or by what He was. The entire four Gospels are God&rsquo;s speaking in Son. Whatever He did, whatever He spoke, whatever He worked, and whatever He behaved was altogether His speaking. The Son&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s speaking in Son. This is a crucial point which we all must realize.</p>
<p>The Hebrew believers may have thought the Son&rsquo;s speaking stopped when He went to the heavens. This speaking, however, is still going on. If we did not have Hebrews in the Bible, we might think that the Son&rsquo;s speaking stopped when He ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>Hebrews and Revelation were the two main books of the seven books which were not recognized as part of the divine revelation until A.D. 397. (The other five were James, 2 and 3 John, 2 Peter, and Jude.) The Nicene Creed was made in A.D. 325, and by that time Hebrews and Revelation, which both refer to God&rsquo;s speaking in Son in the heavens, were not yet recognized as Scripture. This shows the subtlety of the enemy. It was in Carthage, North Africa in A.D. 397 that these two books with the other five were fully recognized to complete the twenty-seven books of our present New Testament. Without these two books we could only realize that God spoke in Son while He was on the earth. Acts does not tell us what the ascended Christ is doing in the heavens. Without Hebrews and Revelation it would be hard for us to know anything concerning the speaking of God in Son in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Good Word of God<br />
and the Word of Righteousness</h2>
<p>In the Son&rsquo;s speaking God or in God speaking in Son there are two categories of the word: the good word of God, that is, the word of the beginning of the Christ, and the word of righteousness. Hebrews 6:1 says, &ldquo;Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ.&rdquo; The beginning of today&rsquo;s educational system is kindergarten. This may be likened to the stage of the word of the beginning of the Christ which is only good as milk for babes (5:12-13). Paul continues in 6:1&mdash;&ldquo;Let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; Paul is telling the Hebrew believers not to remain in the kindergarten stage but to go on to maturity, &ldquo;not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms and of laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.&rdquo; Many Christians are laying foundation after foundation. Sometimes they may think that a certain foundation is not so good, so they replace it with another foundation. Consequently, there is no building up. The foundation, which is the word of the beginning of the Christ, is firstly repentance from dead works and then faith toward God. A certain Christian may have repented and believed in the Lord Jesus. A year later, he may have heard a revival message and gone back to repent and believe again. After another period of time another revivalist came and stirred him up again. This is the work of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Every year there is a revival and every year there is a stirring up. People repent again and believe in God again year after year. Is anyone, however, going on to maturity?</p>
<p>The word of the beginning of the Christ also involves the teaching of baptisms, including water baptism and Spirit baptism. Specifically, baptisms here refer to the washings of utensils and vessels used in the tabernacle or temple for God&rsquo;s service (Lev. 6:28). The washings of the priests are probably also included (Exo. 30:18-21; Lev. 16:4). This word, no doubt, also applies to the New Testament baptism. The word of the beginning of the Christ, which is mentioned as the good word of God, also includes the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</p>
<p>Paul says in 6:3, &ldquo;And this we will do if God permits.&rdquo; This means we will do what is mentioned in verse 1: &ldquo;let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; Paul continues to say, &ldquo;For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who were once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age&rdquo; (6:4-5). Those who were once enlightened, and who tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age, laid the foundation already at the time they believed. Once they have fallen away and turned back there is no need for them to lay the foundation again (v. 1), but only to go on, to be brought on, to maturity. There is no need to repeat their repentance, for it is impossible to renew again that repentance. Hebrews 6:1 indicates that this is not needed; verse 4 says that it is not possible; and verses 7 and 8 show that it is not right.</p>
<p>The good word of God is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the kindergarten stage. Repentance, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment are all concerned and wrapped up with Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry. Without His earthly ministry you have no way to repent, to receive baptism, to lay hands on others, to receive resurrection, or to escape eternal judgment. Any word concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the kindergarten stage. This is surely the good word because it is the glad tidings, the good news. The very good news preached by today&rsquo;s Christians is the word of the beginning of the Christ, the good word of God, the word in the beginning stage of the Christian life. In 5:12-13 the good word of God is considered by Paul as milk, not solid food. Even Peter says that as newborn babes we should desire the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2). This is also the word of the beginning of the Christ, the good word of God, the word in the kindergarten stage.</p>
<p>With this enjoyment of the tasting of the heavenly gift, the partaking of the Holy Spirit, and the tasting of the good word of God, there is another tasting&mdash;the tasting of the works of power of the coming age (6:5). The works of power of the coming age are listed with the good word of God in the kindergarten stage. The tasting of the works of power of the coming age is the subsidiary tasting, not the main tasting.</p>
<p>The first category of the word is the word of the beginning of the Christ which is the good word of God and in 5:13 is another category&mdash;the word of righteousness. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food. For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.&rdquo; The beginning of the oracles of God equals the word of the beginning of the Christ. Milk in verse 13 refers to the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God mentioned in verse 12, whereas the word of righteousness refers to the solid food. &ldquo;The good word&rdquo; mentioned in 6:5 is &ldquo;the word of the beginning of the Christ&rdquo; (6:1). But the word of righteousness is deeper than the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God&rsquo;s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. This word is more difficult to discriminate than the word of grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32) and the word of life (Phil. 2:16).</p>
<p>This is why very few Christians today understand the Bible in the way of God&rsquo;s dispensations. Among all the different theologies, according to my study, only the theology of the Brethren has opened up the dispensations. When we come to the Word of God, we must take care of God&rsquo;s dispensations. To take care of God&rsquo;s dispensations is to understand the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>The word of righteousness comprises the entire book of Hebrews. God&rsquo;s speaking in Son and the Son&rsquo;s speaking God has two categories of word&mdash;the word of the beginning of the Christ which is for the babes, and the word of righteousness which is the solid food for the mature ones. In this word of righteousness the heavenly ministry of Christ is unveiled. This is only revealed in Hebrews and in Revelation. Only in these two books can we see a clear picture of what Christ is doing in the heavens.</p>
<p>In Hebrews we are told that now in the heavens Christ is the heavenly Minister (8:2) and He is also the heavenly High Priest (8:1). Furthermore, He is the heavenly Mediator to execute the very will He made as a new covenant bequeathed to us (8:6). In this will there are many bequests, and He is now in the heavens to carry out this will as a Mediator. Then in the book of Revelation we are told that He is now in the heavens as the Lord of lords and the King of kings (17:14; 19:16), and He is the one that is carrying out God&rsquo;s governmental administration in the whole universe (5:5-6). Without these two books we would not know what Christ is doing in the heavenlies after His ascension. We would only know the speaking of God in Son concerning His earthly ministry which is only in the kindergarten stage.</p>
