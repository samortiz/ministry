The Street</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 says, &#8220;The street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.&#8221; The gates are for entering the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living. The entering into the New Jerusalem as the holy city is through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living, in the city is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold. This indicates that following the entrance of regeneration, the daily life and walk of the saints must be in the way of the divine nature.<h2 class=head3>1. A Unique Street Spiraling Down throughout the City to Reach All of the Twelve Gates</h2><p>The street in the New Jerusalem is uniquely one. There is no maze, no leading astray, and no getting lost. No matter through which gate a believer enters, he will find himself on the unique street. On this unique street we are one.<p>The street of the New Jerusalem is a spiral, coming down from the throne of God to reach all God&#8217;s chosen. Because the unique street is a spiral, it reaches every gate. This street also leads us from the gates to the throne.<h2 class=head3>2. Of Pure Gold, Signifying the Nature of God</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 tells us that the street of the holy city is pure gold. The street is part of the city proper, and every part of the city proper is gold. We have seen that gold signifies the nature of God. After we enter into the New Jerusalem, we must walk on the divine nature as our way. As we walk on the golden street, we are spontaneously regulated, for a street regulates. In the New Jerusalem everyone is regulated by the unique street, by the golden nature of God within us.<h2 class=head3>3. Like Transparent Glass, Signifying without Any Opaqueness</h2><p>The pure gold of the unique street in the New Jerusalem is &#8220;as transparent glass,&#8221; signifying without any opaqueness. The golden street is crystal clear, without any opaqueness. This indicates that if we take God&#8217;s nature as our unique way, we will be pure, without any mixture, and transparent without opaqueness.<h2 class=head2>J. The Throne</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Center of the City</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 says, &#8220;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&#8221; The throne here is the center of the New Jerusalem. Every nation has a center. The center of a nation is its capital, the place where the central government is located. The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of our redeeming God, the throne of God and of the Lamb.<p>According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem, on which the redeeming God, as indicated by the expression &#8220;God and the Lamb,&#8221; carries out His administration based upon His redemption, in His eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth, to keep everything in the universe in the order that serves His purpose.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
