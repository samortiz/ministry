   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Receiving the Revelation concerning Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 13 the Lord asked His disciples a question: Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a man, Christ was a mystery, not only to that generation, but also to people today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ Not Being John the Baptist,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Elijah, Jeremiah, or One of the Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 14 says, And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At most, people can only recognize that Christ is the greatest among the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without heavenly revelation, no one can know that He is the Christ and the Son of the living God v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ, the Son of the Living God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Lord asked His disciples to say who they thought He was, Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The Christ, as the anointed One of God, refers to the Lord s commission; whereas the Son of the living God, as the second of the Triune God, refers to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His commission is to accomplish God s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent, whereas His person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The living God is in contrast to dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord is the embodiment of the living God, having nothing to do with dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revealed by the Heavenly Father</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>under His Blessing, Not by Flesh and Blood</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 17 says, And Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father Who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Flesh and blood refer to man, who is composed of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the Father knows the Son 11:27 ; hence, only He can reveal the Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. Receiving the Revelation concerning the Church</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 18 the Lord said, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father s revelation concerning Christ is just the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the Lord needed also to reveal to Peter the second half, which is concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Building of the Church a. By Christ</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 18 the Lord said, I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s building of His church began at the day of Pentecost Acts 2:1-4, 41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet the Lord s prophecy here has still not been fulfilled, even by the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christendom, composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, is not the Lord s building of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This prophecy is fulfilled through the Lord s recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words My church indicate that the church is of the Lord, not of any person or thing; it is not like the denominations, which are denominated after some person s name or according to some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Upon the Rock</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord told Peter that He would build His church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The words this rock refer not only to Christ, but also to this revelation of Christ, which Peter received from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is built on this revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Roman Catholicism claims that the rock in verse 18 refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although it is correct to say that the rock denotes Christ, not even this understanding is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The rock here refers not only to Christ, but even the more to the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this chapter the Father reveals something from the heavens to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This heavenly revelation from the Father is the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not an insignificant matter that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The denominations are not built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, the Southern Baptist denomination is built upon the revelation of baptism by immersion, not upon the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same principle, the Presbyterian denomination is built upon the doctrine of presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, the charismatic churches or groups are not built upon this revelation concerning Christ; they are built upon their knowledge of the charismatic things and on their experience of them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the Foursquare denomination is built upon the revelation of the foursquare gospel, not on the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church that is built upon the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The problem today is that Christians like to form groups or so-called churches according to their concept and viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But their concept is not the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church must be built upon this rock, that is, upon the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we see this, we shall be saved from division.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only one thing is built upon the revelation of Christ, and that is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The revelation concerning Christ is the rock upon which the Lord Jesus is building His church.</S>
