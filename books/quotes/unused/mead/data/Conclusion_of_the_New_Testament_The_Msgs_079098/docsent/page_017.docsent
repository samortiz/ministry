   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 ink is a symbol of the Spirit: "Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The writer of this letter is not the Spirit of God; the writer is the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of the living God is the "ink," the element, the essence of the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the Spirit of the living God is the element with which the letter is written.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is neither the writer nor the instrument used for writing; rather, the Spirit is the essence, the element, the substance, used in writing.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Paul's view of the Spirit here is that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ.</S>
