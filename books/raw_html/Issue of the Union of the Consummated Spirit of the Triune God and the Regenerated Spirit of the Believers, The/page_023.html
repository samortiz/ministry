<P>We all need to see what the Body of Christ is. The Body of Christ is not the totality of all the churches added together.  Verses 3 through 6 in Ephesians 4 first speak of the basic nature of the Body, with the redeemed people as the outward framework and the redeeming God as the inward element. Verses 7 through 16 speak of the building up of this Body. The Body of Christ is similar to the human body. It is not produced by assembling pieces together as in the building of a  house. A house is built by first laying the foundation, then setting up the frame, and then putting pieces of stone on the frame. But our body is not like that. As soon as a person is born, he possesses a complete set of members. What is needed is growth. I often use my grandson as an illustration. When he was born, he weighed only six pounds and was kept in an incubator. However, because he received proper nourishment, today he is not only grown up but has also become very strong. Hence, the building up of the Body is through feeding. When the Body receives the feeding, it will grow gradually; this growth is the building up of the Body.</P><P>The Body is not built up from the outside, but it is grown up from the inside. Growth comes from birth. First there must be birth before there can be growth. Hence, the first step in the producing of the Body of Christ is our regeneration. From God's viewpoint, we were all regenerated through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus on the day of His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). Although many individual believers were brought forth, in God's eyes they are a corporate Body. After the regeneration of the many believers in the resurrection of Christ, what follows in sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation is a matter of nourishment.</P><P>When the Spirit of God regenerates people from within, it is not He Himself who preaches the gospel directly to men to regenerate them. For people to be regenerated, you and I must go to knock on their doors and speak to them. When we speak to people, we must also have a certain skill, like that of a nurse who goes to someone's home to give him an injection. It does not depend on much speaking but on whether you can inject the person at an appropriate time. In our speaking with people, we need to supply people with the riches of Christ at an appropriate time so that the spirit within them becomes operative, that the unsaved ones may be regenerated and the saved ones may be enlightened. The building up of the Body of Christ hinges on this kind of supply in the spirit. Through the mutual supply in the spirit the members of Christ grow together, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the growing up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:13 shows us that this growth requires that everyone arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Verse 15 says that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things. Verse 16 says that the Body will grow gradually unto the building up of itself in love. The growth is the building up. Today, generally speaking, Christianity lacks feeding; hence, it also lacks the growth. This is the reason that there is no building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. It is a constitution in these two spirits. This constitution, this building, has the saved people as its framework and the saving God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;as its inward element. All three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are dispensed, transfused, and built into God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers. This dispensing within us is a daily matter. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is dispensed and transfused into us day by day and thereby is built into us day by day. This is similar to the foods that we eat. Through digestion, the nutrients of the foods are dispensed into us and transfused into our whole being, and are even built into us to become our element, even to become us. Similarly, the Triune God through His dispensing, transfusing, and building becomes us and is built up together with us. Thus we are growing gradually for the accomplishing of the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is dispensing, transfusing, and building Himself into the believers whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed, so that they and the God who redeemed and transformed them can be constituted into a corporate entity, which is the organic Body of Christ. This entity is God yet man, man yet God (Eph. 4:3-4a). This constitution of divinity and humanity is unique in the universe. It should not be divided and cannot be divided.</P>
