<p>In Acts 6:4 the apostles said that they would &ldquo;continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; The apostles continually prayed and ministered the word. We should believe that Peter spent more time praying than ministering the word and that he spent more time praying than preparing to minister the word. I believe that the preparation for his messages was prayer. He prepared the spirit of speaking through prayer, and he released his message in the spirit of prayer. How about our speaking? Perhaps we spend one hour searching for material and compiling an outline, but we do not pray for half an hour. We speak, but we do not pray, or we speak much, but we pray little. As a result, our messages touch the mind of the saints instead of their spirit.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter gave a message that pricked people in their heart (2:37). The words touched the depth of their being. Those words were spoken from the spirit and were spirit and life. What we speak from the podium is mainly words; there is not much spirit and life. We speak from our mind; therefore, our spirit does not move.</p>
<p>We know that the messages should convey the Spirit. Therefore, the speaking brothers spend a little time to prepare their spirit in prayer. Without this prayer, our messages would be letters and complete vanity. However, we need to spend more time in prayer and less time preparing for the messages. We should spend all of our time in prayer. We need to touch the feeling of God and His thoughts in prayer, and we need to speak these thoughts and feelings in prayer. Then even if the logic of the message is not that strong, the spirit of the saints will still be touched. Frankly speaking, what matters in a message is not the logic but the importance of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING IN ORDER TO LEAD OTHERS</h2>
<p>We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and acknowledge that He is the wise God. He is the Word and the Spirit. He gave us the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit. If we want to serve Him in a proper way, we must use our eyes, ears, mind, and heart to deal with His Word, and we must use our spirit to deal with His Spirit. Not only do we contact His Word, but we must also pray in our spirit. We need to use our whole being&mdash;eyes, ears, mind, heart, and spirit&mdash;to serve God. We must learn this before we can lead the saints into this practice. We can no longer listen and read without praying. It is best to read the Bible for a certain amount of time and then pray for the same amount of time. The amount of time that we spend to listen to a message or to read the Word is the amount of time that we should spend in prayer. If this would be our practice, the outcome will be very rich.</p>
<p>We have said that we speak much but pray very little, so our spirit seems poor and weak. Some saints have come to every Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting for one year and have heard every message, but their spirit is as dead as that of an unsaved person. The responsible brothers in every locality should consider the condition of the spirit of prayer of the saints who are in the meetings regularly. Is their spirit living or dead, strong or weak, fresh or old? The saints need to pray after every message, and they need to pray after reading the Bible.</p>
<p>We cannot lead others into something that we do not practice. If we want the saints to pray, we must pray first. If we want the saints to pray much, we must pray much. There is not enough prayer among the serving ones. We discuss, fellowship, and study much, but we pray too little. We cannot say that we know enough, but our prayer cannot compare with what we know. We are short of genuine prayer; we do not spend enough time in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TOPICS AND WORDS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Perhaps some saints would ask, what are the topics for prayer, or what words should they use? The answer is in the Psalms. Some psalms are long and others are short. Most of them are prayers, and they do not use routine words. They are words of praise to appreciate the virtues of God, extol His glory, thank Him for His lovingkindness, and praise His doings. When we pray, we do not praise, thank, or extol the Lord; instead, we ask for peace, benefits, and spiritual things. The Psalms are prayers that are filled with praise, worship, and thanks, and they declare the glory of the Lord. Our prayers do not match these prayers because we lack practice. If we would pray frequently every day, we will have more words of praise, thanks, and extolment.</p>
<p>One of the brothers gave a message concerning the knowledge of the Lord, but the material seemed dry and tasteless, so the saints could not digest or apply it. It is good to have rich material, but we also need to have much prayer in order to digest it. If the saints would be willing to consider the verses concerning the knowledge of the Lord and turn them into prayer, they will</p>
<p>have many topics to pray over. Such prayers would be fragrant and acceptable to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING IN BALANCE</h2>
<p>In the past we over-emphasized the Word but neglected the Spirit. We gave many messages, but we did not exercise our spirit enough. This does not mean that we should neglect the Word but that we should pay equal attention to the Spirit. We do not want to be unbalanced. We want to balance the Word with the Spirit. Just as we have focused on the Word, we will now focus on the Spirit. Every saint must receive the Word and contact the Spirit in a good way. Then we will not only understand with our mind, but our spirit will also be strong. We need a balanced development in both the Word and the Spirit so that there will be a way for God&rsquo;s building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
