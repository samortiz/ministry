   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meaning of Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 3:3 says, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two verses show what circumcision is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Simply put, circumcision is the removal of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should be the attitude of those who are circumcised?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should have no confidence in the flesh and should not put their trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "confidence" in Philippians 3:3 can be translated "trust" according to the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who are the circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and who put no trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, circumcision deals with man's inherent energy, his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How appropriate it was for God to say such a word to Abraham!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God showed Abraham that whatever he did and begot by himself was just Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the flesh is not dealt with, one will have no part in God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the flesh is not dealt with, one cannot be of God's people and cannot maintain His testimony or participate in His recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The greatest problem among God's children is that they do not know what the flesh is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flesh that many Christians know is merely related to the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is true that the flesh causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the flesh does not cause man to just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:8 says that "those who are in the flesh cannot please God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the flesh has tried to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times, the goal of the flesh may not be to try to offend God; its goal may be to try to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 7 shows us that the flesh exerts great effort to keep the law, to do good, to do God's will, and to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, it cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our experience tells us that it is comparatively easy to deal with the sinning flesh, but it is very difficult to deal with the flesh that tries to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the flesh that tries to creep into God's work and service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the flesh that creeps into all the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people do not realize that man cannot please God by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They think that even though they were once a certain kind of person, now they can do good because their goal has changed since they have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such people do not realize that God is concerned not merely with changing their goals, but with terminating their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they want to please God with their flesh, God will tell them that the flesh cannot please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must see that circumcision is the cutting off of the flesh, the very flesh that begets Ishmael, the flesh that tries to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Circumcision deals with the flesh that tries to do God's will and to fulfill His promise by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was what God wanted Abraham to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The greatest problem with God's children is that their flesh is not dealt with before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They believe in the flesh and put their trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most obvious sign of unchecked flesh is self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Self-confidence is the characteristic of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Philippians 3:3 says, "We are the circumcision, the ones who...have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To put no trust in the flesh is to have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who have been smitten by the cross are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although their person may remain, they have learned to fear God and no longer put their trust and confidence in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before a person is dealt with by the Lord, he quickly judges anything that comes his way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He opens his mouth and makes judgments quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But after a person has been dealt with by the Lord, he does not judge lightly; he no longer has any confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one who makes quick proposals and believes in his own strength knows the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a person has never experienced the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once our flesh is circumcised, we will not believe in ourselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will not be that full of confidence, and we will not express our opinions easily.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before the Lord, we must see that we are weak, powerless, helpless, and faltering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God brought Abraham to the point where he realized that his flesh needed to be dealt with, and that the things he did during the past thirteen years were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was no room in God's promise for him to do or accomplish anything; all he needed to do was believe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the same time, God showed him that his descendants for generations to come must be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the basic requirement to be God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The condition for us to be God's people in practicality is to have the mark of the cross upon our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Circumcision is the mark of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the proof of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is a mark?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A mark is a characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's people have a characteristic, a mark, which is the denial of the flesh, the rejection of confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's people are those whose confidence in the flesh has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are the ones who have lost confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a pity that so many Christians are so confident about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They know how to believe in the Lord Jesus, and they know how to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They know how to overcome, and they know how to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It seems that there is nothing that they do not know!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They brag again and again about this and that kind of experience that they had on certain days of certain months.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It seems that they are lacking in nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They may talk about how they fellowship with God and how they communicate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They think that they know what God is saying concerning certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They think that they know God's will concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They can talk about what God has told them to speak or pray at such and such a place and at such and such a time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To them, it seems as if knowing God's will is the easiest thing on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet they lack the mark of having "no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such Christians are indeed in need of God's mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The meaning of circumcision is to cut off the confidence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is to cut off the natural strength so that one no longer speaks and walks in a loose way, but instead becomes a fearful and trembling person.</S>
