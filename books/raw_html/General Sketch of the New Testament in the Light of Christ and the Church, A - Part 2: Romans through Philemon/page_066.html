<h2 class=head2>Walking according to the Revelation of Christ</h2><p>Colossians 1:10 says, “To walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God.” To walk worthily of the Lord and grow by the full knowledge of God is to live and walk according to spiritual wisdom and understanding. After we receive the revelation and vision concerning Christ, we have to walk according to it. Then we will walk worthily of the Lord and partake of the Lord more and more. In this way we grow by Christ being increased in us. The way for Christ to increase in us is by our receiving spiritual wisdom, understanding, and revelation concerning Christ and by walking according to the spiritual revelation of Christ that we have received. This is to gain the real, subjective, and experiential knowledge of God, by which we grow with the increase of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Being Empowered with All Power</h2><p>Verse 11 says, “Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy.” We need the inner empowering according to the might of His glory. This is not only to have revelation in our understanding; it is something more. It is that the Holy Spirit within us strengthens us, energizes us, and imparts the might of God’s glory into us.<p>First we have revelation and vision in our spiritual understanding. Then, we make the decision to walk according to that vision. Third, we look to the Lord that He may strengthen us with His power. This is the proper way to walk in Christ.<h2 class=head1>ROOTED AND BUILT UP IN CHRIST</h2><p>The tenth main point in Colossians is found in 2:7, which says, “Having been rooted and being built up in Him.” Having been rooted and being built up are different verb tenses. Our being rooted is already accomplished, but our being built up is a process. We have been rooted in Christ. There is no need for us to be rooted again because this has already been accomplished. What we need now is to be built up.<p>To be built up has two meanings. On the one hand, we ourselves need to be built up with Christ just as a little child needs to be built up into an adult. Although we have been rooted in Christ, the measure of Christ within us may be small; we may not have an adequate measure of Christ. If we are built up with Christ, we will have a proper measure of Christ within us. On the other hand, we need to be built up with others. Colossians emphasizes Christ as the Head of the Body. All the members themselves must be built up, and they must also be built together as the Body.<p>The second aspect of building depends on the first. If we ourselves have not been built up, how can we be built together with others? To be built together with others depends on our being built up. Our growing in Christ is a matter not only of receiving Christ and walking in Him but of being built up ourselves and being built up with others. These are very important matters with many details.<p>To be rooted in Christ means that we are plants who have been put in Christ as our soil. Therefore, we must enjoy Christ, experience Him, and be built up in Him. In order to build, we need materials. As we are plants, Christ is the soil to us, and as we are the building, He is the very material with which we are built. An American child is built up by eating the produce of America, such as beef, chicken, fish, and fruit. In the same way, our spiritual measure is built up by feeding on Christ. At present we may have a small spiritual measure. We need to grow to a greater measure of Christ, and the way to grow in measure is by feeding on Christ, taking Him in, and digesting Him. Then He will be added to us more and more. We will have Christ increased within us, and our measure will grow. Christ is the material for the building up of our spiritual measure. For us to be rooted, Christ is the soil, and for us to be built up, Christ is the material. Christ is the very substance, element, and material for us to grow and be built up.<p>We have received Christ. Now we need to walk in Him and by Him. In order to walk in Him, we need to know Him in revelation and vision, and after we receive the revelation, we have to walk according to what we see. Then we open to Him and allow the Holy Spirit to strengthen us into our spirit, imparting the might of His glory into us that we might be empowered to walk in Christ. Then we must realize that we have been rooted in Christ. Christ is the very source of our supply, and as the soil He is our entire supply. From Christ as the soil we absorb all the supply we need to grow. He is the very material, substance, and element with which we can have a greater measure in spirit. All this in total is the growth of Christ. I hope that you will spend time to bring these matters to the Lord, to pray about them, and to learn to practice them. We must realize all these matters and put them into practice. Then we will have the real experience of Christ. We will then be able to help others, not merely to teach them about Christ but to minister to them the living knowledge and experience of Christ.
