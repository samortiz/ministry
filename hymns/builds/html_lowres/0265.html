The blood implies termination and redemption, and the anointing oil implies germination, a new beginning. As terminated, redeemed, and germinated ones, the priests had a new beginning, through which they could serve God (cf. Rom. 7:6).<br>See note 21<sup>1</sup>.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7), i.e., abide in the divine light (v. 10).

<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12156' href='#ref_12156'>Exo 30:25</a></span> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.<br><b>fn 1 </b>This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices (vv. 23-24), is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; cf. notes 39<sup>1</sup> in John 7 and 19<sup>4</sup> in Phil. 1). The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death (Rom. 8:13); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection (Phil. 3:10); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit (Gen. 1:2). Since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God's creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. Lev. 2:4 and note 3). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9 and note 4) through Christ's sufferings (Matt. 26:36 and note). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being split by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (Matt. 25:2 and note 1), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God's building (see note 15<sup>2</sup> in Gen. 6), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God's building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God's eternal dwelling place.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

They signify the initial Spirit (see note 29<sup>2</sup>) becoming the uniting Spirit to join all the members of Christ into one Body (Eph. 4:3-4). The boards stand in silver, signifying Christ's redemptive work, and they are united by gold, signifying Christ's divine person. That the bars were made of acacia wood indicates that the oneness of the Spirit involves not only Christ's divinity but also His humanity (Eph. 4:2 and note). In actuality, the uniting bars signify not the Holy Spirit alone, but the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit (Rom. 8:16)-the mingled spirit, which includes both divinity and humanity.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Hence, to anoint signifies to apply the processed and consummated Triune God with all His elements and processes as a whole to the object of the anointing, thus making this object absolutely one with the compounded, consummated God. For us to be anointed (2 Cor. 1:21) means that the processed Triune God is put into us and upon us and even mingled with us to make us God-men, those who are one with God.

The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God as our portion in Christ.<br>God's attaching us to Christ issues in three things: (1) an anointing that imparts God's elements into us; (2) a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image; and (3) a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. Through these three experiences of the anointing Spirit, with the experience of the cross, the ministry of Christ is produced.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
