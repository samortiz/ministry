   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Portion of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians first reveals that Christ is the portion of the saints 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As believers in Christ, we gain Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most Christians speak of our portion as being only redemption, salvation, and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is easy to understand that these items are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, it is more difficult to understand what it means for Christ to be our portion and how to enjoy Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we drink a cup of coffee, the coffee is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we eat breakfast, all the items included in our breakfast are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to see the many items that are included in Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Image of the Invisible God,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Firstborn of All Creation,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and the One in Whom, through Whom,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and unto Whom All Things Were Created</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ, who is our portion, is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is invisible, yet He has an image that is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Christ we know God and see God John 1:18; 14:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is revealed and made visible in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is visible to us because Christ our portion is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 15 of Colossians 1 also says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although Christ is the Creator, this verse says that He is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some Christian theologians think that it is heresy to say that Christ, who as God is the Creator, is also part of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can explain this mysterious fact, but it is clearly stated in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 16 says, In Him all things were created...all things have been created through Him and unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto, or for, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The One Who Is before All Things</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and the One in Whom All Things Cohere</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 17 says, He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word cohere means to subsist together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This matter may be illustrated by the way the spokes of a wheel subsist in the hub.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the hub is removed, the spokes and the wheel will fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The hub is the center that keeps all the other parts of the wheel together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Scientists have discovered that there is a hub, a center, that holds everything in the universe together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is this hub.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything in the universe coheres in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To cohere is to exist in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We exist in a particular way, because apparently we are standing on the earth, but intrinsically the earth is holding us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without the holding power of the earth, we would fly off into space.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a cohering power in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything in the universe, including each of us, coheres in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the hub of the universe that holds all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without Christ as the holding power, everything in the universe would fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Head of the Body, the Beginning,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Firstborn from the Dead,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>the One Who Has the First Place in All Things, and the One in Whom</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the Fullness Was Pleased to Dwell</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 18 through 19 say, He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the Firstborn in creation and the Firstborn in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The new creation was produced in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is the Firstborn in both creations, in the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Him all the fullness, the full expression of the rich being of God in both the creation and the church, was pleased to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Mystery of God and the One in Whom</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the Fullness of the Godhead Dwells Bodily</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is altogether a mystery, and this mystery is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words, Christ is the definition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then verse 9 says, In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fullness of the Godhead, the expression of the riches of what God is, dwells in Christ as one who has a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We could never fully explain or define all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not have the adequate knowledge to expound all the profound items of Christ revealed in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We could never even exhaust the significance of the two terms the mystery of God and the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
