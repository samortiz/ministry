   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TWO-SIDED TRUTH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that the Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul in a prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While he was in prison, Paul wrote not only the Epistle to the Philippians but also the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Each of these three books has its own special emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians is on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians is on Christ and His relationship to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Philippians does not cover deep doctrines like Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its general subject stresses one thing, which is to have no discord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philippians 4:2 says, "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two workers were sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was disharmony between them, and Paul wrote to exhort them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians pays considerable attention to humility, harmony, and loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Philippians can be considered as a kind of footnote to 1 Corinthians 13.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul exhorted the Philippians to have lowliness of mind and to consider others more excellent than themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each should not regard his own virtues, but the virtues of others also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he spoke of the Lord's emptying Himself, how He took the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, and humbling Himself to become obedient unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told them that this was the mind of Christ, and he exhorted them to have this mind in them, which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But immediately a problem arose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although they might have been willing to follow this example, they were unable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is one thing to hear and another thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostle Paul spoke of the Lord's emptying Himself, His humbling, and His becoming obedient unto the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is such a lofty standard.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two sisters might have wondered how they could meet this high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Paul had to go on to tell them how they could reach this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the subject of verses 12 through 18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"So then" indicates that these verses are a continuation of the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The words "my beloved" were used whenever Paul was about to say something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since he addressed them this way, what follows was very important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul was saying in effect, "When I preached the gospel among you, you obeyed me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now that some troubles have started, you should obey me all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only was the gospel preached to you when I was among you, and not only was I a pattern to you, but you obeyed me while I was in contact with you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, you should obey me now all the more."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These words reveal three things: 1 While Paul was with them, they obeyed because they were in contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 While Paul was away, they were still obedient because Paul had committed them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3 Now they needed to obey in one thing more to work out their salvation in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should read these words over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fear is towards God, while trembling is towards oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, we should fear God, and on the other hand, we should be trembling in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because temptation is so fierce, we should tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because God is so great, we should fear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But please note how this salvation is being worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We thank the Lord that God has a way to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible divides salvation into three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first stage is in the past, when God saved us out of the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second stage is in the present, when God saves us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The third stage is in the future, when God will save us into the kingdom to reign with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can illustrate these by a few examples:</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second Timothy 1:9: "Who has saved us."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone who believes has obtained this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hebrews 7:25: "He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a present salvation, something that we obtain today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hebrews 9:28: "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a future salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible clearly shows us that there are three kinds of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One is in the past, one is in the present, and one is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although some Christians have received the past salvation, they may not have received the present and future salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some Christians have received the past salvation as well as the present salvation, and they will also receive the future salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is possible for a person to be delivered from the punishment of hell yet still sin every day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A person may be delivered from the punishment of hell, but he may not necessarily be able to reign in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let me quote three more passages to prove these three stages of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ephesians 2:8: "For by grace you have been saved."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the past salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Romans 5:10: "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the present salvation which we receive through the life of the Lord.</S>
