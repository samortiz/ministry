   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FOUR THE LIFE USEFUL TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Exodus reveals the kind of people God can use in His economy for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s intention as seen in this book is to have a people to build Him a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, at the end of Exodus the tabernacle is erected to be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, for the fulfillment of God s purpose, there is also the need for an army to fight for God s interests on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children of Israel came out of Egypt as a collective people, and right away they were formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the time of their redemption until the conquest of the good land, they had to subdue the enemies, especially the enemies who had occupied and fully possessed the land promised to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the children of Israel were to enjoy the good land and to fulfill God s purpose of building a temple as God s testimony on earth, they had to fight to deliver the land from the usurping hand of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, to be useful to God is related to building up His dwelling place and to fighting for His interests on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life useful to God in these matters is the female life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the natural concept, however, it should be the male life that is useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because the males are good fighters, whereas the females are regarded as weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not many readers of Exodus 1 and 2 have seen the underlying theme that links these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter one shows that the people of God were under slavery, and chapter two reveals how God prepared one to save His people out of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The underlying theme is that God needs a certain kind of life both to preserve His people and to prepare a savior to deliver them from bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the preservation of the people and the preparation of the savior were accomplished only through the female life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible the concept of a male is rich in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It refers, of course, to a man, but it also indicates an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, it refers to Christ as the unique male in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All married brothers need to realize that they are simply husbands in shadow and that the real husband is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because God is the unique husband, Isaiah 54:5 says, Thy Maker is thine husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament God regarded His people as His spouse Hosea 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter whether an Israelite was a male or a female, he or she was part of God s corporate wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible the term husband indicates headship, and it also indicates an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we speak of a male in the positive sense, we have in mind a husband who is the head and who has an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because God is the unique husband in the universe, only He is the head and only He has an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is blasphemous to say that God needs to depend on anyone or anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is also blasphemous to claim that we can be independent of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As females, the married sisters should not usurp the headship, nor should they live in an independent way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, they must live a life of dependence upon their husbands, who are but shadows of the Lord as the real husband.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the married brothers are husbands in shadow with respect to their wives, in actuality they are females with respect to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, they should not usurp the headship of the Lord nor have an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They also should be submissive and live a life of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I. GOD BEING THE HEAD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is the head of Christ 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not accurate to say that God is our head, for it is Christ who is the head of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>CHRIST, UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEING THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Corinthians 11:3 says, The head of every man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Himself Christ is not the head of every man; He is the head of all men under the headship of God.</S>
