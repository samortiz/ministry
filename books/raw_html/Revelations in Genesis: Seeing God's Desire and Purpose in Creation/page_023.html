        <h2 class="head3">The Principle and the Content, Nature,<br />
and Issue of the Two Trees</h2>
<p>The content, nature, and issue of the tree of life are life, and the principle of the tree of life is dependence. Matters of life are in the principle of dependence. For example, our breathing is a matter of life. A brother who takes a deep breath when he gets up in the morning still needs to breathe during the rest of the day. He cannot stop breathing. Similarly, a sister who eats breakfast must still eat lunch. She cannot say, &ldquo;I am a veteran at eating; I do not need to eat anymore.&rdquo; Matters of life must not be stopped or interrupted. This is dependence. Even though we eat every day, we still need to eat every day if we have lived sixty years. We would die if we did not eat for a month, drink for a week, or breathe for two minutes. Life cannot stop or be interrupted. Therefore, the principle of the tree of life is dependence. The principle of the tree of life is to be dependent on God daily, that is, to fellowship with Him, live in Him, and never leave Him, not even for a moment. Whenever we leave God, we have death. Whenever our fellowship with God is interrupted, our sense of life and the light of life will stop within us. When we leave God, everything of God stops. This is the principle of the tree of life.</p>
<p>No one should ever say, &ldquo;I am a veteran at being in God and at having fellowship with Him, so I do not need to fellowship this morning.&rdquo; When we do not have fellowship with God and do not live in our spirit, the sense of life within us stops. This is death. The tree of life is a matter of life, and its principle is dependence on God, of not being severed from Him.</p>
<p>The principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is different. Its content is everything outside of God, its nature is death, its issue is death, and its principle is independence. The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, but the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence from God. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil may be referred to as the tree of knowledge. Life is versus knowledge. Life requires dependence, but knowledge produces independence. The principle of the tree of life is for man to depend on God, but the principle of the tree of knowledge is for man to be independent of God.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hired servant who is told what household chores to do and how to do them. If she does not understand, she may need some help the first few days, but after she understands, she will do things according to her knowledge. Then she will not need to be dependent. We like employees who can work in this way. When a servant learns quickly and does things according to what she has learned, the employer will be satisfied. However, we would not be happy if our children learned everything and no longer needed us. We want to see our children in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. The more we see them and have intimate conversations with them, the happier and sweeter we feel inside. We are not happy if we do not see our children for a long period of time.</p>
<p>The children of God need to live in God by beholding His face constantly and having many intimate conversations with Him. As servants of God, we also need to live in Him. We should not consider ourselves as &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; servants of God, who know everything about God&rsquo;s house, who always do everything correctly, and who, therefore, do not need to see God&rsquo;s face. We must bear in mind that such servants are not well pleasing to God. There is no such thing as a veteran servant of God. God does not want service based on knowledge but service in life. Service based on knowledge is in the principle of independence, because a person can &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; from God. With service in life there are no veterans, for we can never graduate from, be apart from, or be independent of God. The service of life requires dependence on God. If we depended on Him when we gave a message yesterday, we still need to depend on Him in order to give a message today. We should not think that because a message was good in Taipei, it can be given in the same way in Tainan. Such an assumption is in the principle of independence. Knowledge makes man independent.</p>
<p>Some people say that since they have fifty messages prepared, they need to prepare only two more messages in order to be able to give a message every Lord&rsquo;s Day of the year. Such messages are according to knowledge, which results in death. A good message is in life. Those who speak life do not care about how many messages they know. Every time they speak, it is as if they do not know how to speak. They depend on God, fellowship with God, contact God, and live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Now we know the significance of these two trees. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything outside of God. The content, nature, and issue of the tree of life are life, and its principle is dependence on God. The content of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is knowledge, good, and evil, that is, everything outside of God. The nature and issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are death, and the principle of this tree is independence from God. Therefore, when we depend on God, touch Him, and have fellowship with Him, we are living by the tree of life. When we are independent from God, we may still pray, preach the gospel, give messages, and live our daily life, but we have left God and are living outside of God. The nature and issue of such a living is death.</p>
<p>Just as Adam was placed between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man is still in between these two trees today. Man must choose God or choose that which is outside of God. If he chooses God, he will depend on God, but if he chooses that which is outside of God, he will become independent of God. If we always live in God and have fellowship with Him, we are choosing the tree of life. However, if we go away from God and become severed from Him, we are choosing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>To touch the tree of life is to be dependent; that is, we look to God, depend on Him, have fellowship with Him daily, and always contact Him inwardly. Then even our visiting of the brothers and sisters will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit, giving a message will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit, and praying will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit. When our living is a matter of contacting God, we are choosing the tree of life, which issues in life. Otherwise, we are independent of God and not relying on our fellowship with Him; instead, we are choosing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and unveil us to see that wanting only God and depending on Him in everything is to live by the tree of life. To want anything outside of God and to be independent of Him is to live by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Today we still have these two choices&mdash;God or everything outside of God. If we depend on the life of God, we are in God. If we do not depend on God but are independent of Him, we are outside of God.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, <em>the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</em> does not refer directly to Satan, but it is ultimately related to Satan. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ultimately signifies Satan. Therefore, when Adam stood before these two trees, he was standing before God and Satan. On one side was God, and on the other side was Satan. Adam stood in between God and Satan. This picture fully depicts the condition of the three parties&mdash;God, man, and Satan&mdash;in the universe. God wants to gain man, and Satan wants to gain man. The struggle between God and Satan is focused on man.</p>
<p>Whether it is God or it is Satan who gains man depends on what man chooses. If man chooses the tree of life, he is choosing God and will be gained by God. If man chooses the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he is following Satan and will be gained by Satan. Man&rsquo;s choice in the garden of Eden had a great impact on the universe. God gave man the freedom to choose so that man could choose God or Satan. Choosing God issues in life; choosing Satan issues in death.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
