<p>First Corinthians 10:3 and 4 say, &ldquo;All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; Certain hymns in Christianity refer to Christ being the rock mainly as the solid foundation for our redemption. However, in 1 Corinthians 10 Christ as the rock is not mainly for our redemption but for our drinking and enjoyment. We all need to eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink by drinking of Christ as our rock.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD AT HIS TABLE<br />
TO BECOME HIS ONE BODY</h2>
<p>In verses 16, 17, and 21 Paul speaks concerning the bread and the cup at the Lord&rsquo;s table. On His last night with the disciples, the Lord Jesus did not pick up the Scriptures and expound them, saying, &ldquo;This is My teaching. Keep this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo; In principle, this is the way many in Christianity remember the Lord. Rather, the Lord took bread and a cup. Bread is good only for eating, and a cup is good only for drinking. The Lord said, &ldquo;This do unto the remembrance of Me&rdquo; (11:24; Luke 22:19). By <em>this</em> He was referring to eating the bread and drinking the cup. The best and unique way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to think, to meditate, or to recall but simply to eat and drink Him. The more we eat Jesus at His table, the more He is happy with us. He does not care to see us humble ourselves by kneeling or prostrating ourselves before Him. The Lord may say, &ldquo;Foolish child, I do not care whether you kneel or not. I want to see you eat. The more you eat Me, the happier I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more Christ enters into us, the more we remember Him. The best way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to worship and adore Him as the One who is high above in the third heaven. If we remember the Lord in that way, He may say to us, &ldquo;Foolish ones, I am not only there in the heavens. I am here in your spirit. Simply enjoy Me. The more you eat and drink Me, the happier I am. I do not want to be above you; I want to be constituted into you. I do not want to be separate from you; I want to be one with you.&rdquo; The more we eat, the more the food is constituted into us. After every Lord&rsquo;s table we can tell the universe, including Satan, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! We love Jesus, and now we have more of Him in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10:21 refers to the Lord&rsquo;s table. The Lord&rsquo;s table is not a desk with a Bible for us to study. Rather, it is a table with two &ldquo;main courses,&rdquo; the bread for eating and the cup for drinking. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we feast on the Lord, on His body and on His blood. This feasting issues in our being constituted to be one Body. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.&rdquo; The enjoyment of Christ brings forth the proper church life. If we come together only to exercise our mind, we will eventually stir up disputations in the mind. This will bring in resentment and fighting among us, and we will lose the oneness. Mere doctrinal teachings stir up differing opinions. Even a husband and wife may not be able to agree on certain teachings. It is impossible for us to be one merely by studying the Bible. Instead, the more we eat and drink of Jesus, the more we are one. The enjoyment of Jesus preserves us in oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING POSITIONED IN ONE BODY<br />
TO DRINK OF ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verse 13 of chapter 12 says that we &ldquo;were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We have been positioned to drink the Spirit. This position is in the one Body, the church. If we do not remain in the Body, we will be in the wrong position, and it will be difficult for us to drink. We need to keep the proper position by remaining in the Body. In the church we are drinking the Lord day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF CHRIST AS THE FIRSTFRUITS</h2>
<p>In chapter 15, verse 20 says, &ldquo;Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; The word <em>fruit</em> implies eating, indicating enjoyment. Fresh fruits, such as Washington apples, Florida grapefruit, and California oranges, are all for eating. In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit for us to drink and the firstfruits for us to eat. Christ today is not merely a teacher; He is the firstfruits for us to partake of. Believers have read verse 20 for centuries, but very few have seen that the firstfruits are for eating. Most believers have considered that the word <em>firstfruits</em> in this verse refers only to Christ as the first One raised from the dead. Although Christ is the first in resurrection, the word <em>firstfruits</em> also indicates that the resurrected Christ is to be eaten by us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING PRODUCING TRANSFORMATION<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>All the foregoing points show us the eating and drinking of Jesus in the book of 1 Corinthians. Eating and drinking afford us not only the growth in life but also the transformation in life (3:11-12a). Transformation is not merely an outward correction. It is an inward change in which the supply of Christ as life brings a new element into us and discharges the old element. We are not only growing; we are also being transformed. A few years ago we were &ldquo;muddy clay,&rdquo; but today we can see a certain amount of the element of precious stone within us. We should not be bothered if there is still more mud than stone in our being. After a short while, we will be more transformed, and more of the mud will become precious stone. Our transformation into precious stones is for God&rsquo;s building (v. 9b). Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.&rdquo; The foundation has already been laid, and now we can build upon it, not with wood, grass, or stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones. Eating affords us the growth in life, growth brings in transformation, and transformation is for the building up of the church. We cannot build up a local church merely by teaching or organizing. The only way to build up the church is to feed the saints. We need to feed on Jesus every day. By so doing, we will grow, and by growing, we will be transformed. This will cause us to become a solid piece of precious material that is good for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>This is the reason that for many centuries the subtle enemy, Satan, has hidden the matter of eating and drinking the Lord from God&rsquo;s children. We praise the Lord that in these last days the Lord is recovering this matter. He is removing the veils of religion, our old background, our old doctrines, and our old concepts that we may know His economy. His way to dispense Himself into us is not by teaching but by our eating and drinking the Lord Jesus. As we saw in the previous message, the mystery and depths of 1 Corinthians are the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit. These two spirits are for our eating and drinking the Lord. We eat the Lord and drink the divine Spirit in our human spirit. Therefore, we all need to apply our human spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. To call on the Lord is to eat and drink of Him. This is the strategic point in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROMISE OF EATING AND A CALL TO DRINK<br />
BEING THE CONCLUSION OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The entire Bible concludes with a promise and a call. The promise is that those who wash their robes may have the right to eat of the tree of life (Rev. 22:14). The call is in verse 17, which says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; The promise of eating and the call to drink are the conclusion of the entire Bible. From the beginning to the end, the entire Bible reveals the matter of eating and drinking the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Enjoyment of Christ for the Body in 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
