<h2 class="head2">Bin-Jou, Shensi Province</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, X:</p><p>I received The Open Door and was happy to see some news of brothers that I know, as well as the condition of the work. I was called by the Lord two years ago, but because of my personal situation, I was slow to submit. I did not feel peaceful to remain in my work, but whenever I preached the gospel, my heart was filled with joy. I came to Pinchow to work in the government's Highway Engineering Office. I wanted to quit twice to go preach the gospel, but I was not bold enough to quit and work for the Lord. I often prayed to the Lord and debated with Him, saying, "If You do not want me to work, take away my job. I am not praying to submit to You. If You want me to do something, You do it. If You do not want me to do something, hinder me. Lead me according to Your will." To my surprise the construction project was changed a few days later. They stopped paving the road, so my job was terminated. At the time I planned to go to Hankow via Ch'eng-tu. When I got to Brother Tze-sien's place, I intended to spend some time with the brothers in the Lord and be edified, as well as to learn some hymns and to understand more of the Bible, after which I would begin my work for the Lord. Otherwise, I felt that I would not be worthy to work for the Lord. Later I felt in my heart that I should stay in Bin-Jou for two weeks because some at the Gospel Chapel wanted me to stay. (Last year when I arrived in Bin-Jou, the American, Pastor Nieh, returned to his country, and I was called upon to help them in their meetings many times.) I temporarily moved into the Gospel Chapel. A few days later the order came to prepare for the resumption of the construction project, and I had to stay for awhile. Less than two weeks later, another order came to stop the work again. They wanted to transfer me to Bao-Ji to work on a bridge. The people at the Gospel Chapel cried aloud and tried to keep me there, so I prayed all night with four believers. At three in the morning, the Lord told me, "If you are clear about giving up your work, tell them that you are quitting and come out quickly." I then decided to not work any longer, and the next day I quit my job. On the third day after I came to the Gospel Chapel, Sister Chang Sin-deh and Sister Tsou Hwei-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Chu Cheng-deh and Kuo Ming-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit next. The tongues, prophecies, and spiritual songs which they uttered all had clear translations.</p><p>With regard to the few people in the Gospel Chapel in Bin-Jou, other places had given them the name of Ice-Jou [homonyms in Chinese]. This was an exaggerated way of saying that they were cold to the point of being below zero degrees. The condition of the last few days and the Lord's blessing have proven that through one as humble, useless, foolish, and immature as I, the Lord's church has been helped. Brothers and sisters, please pray for me and the church in Bin-Jou. I know that my condition and my work in the Lord are something that Brother Jung-jieh, Brother Tze-sien, and Brother Shou-ling would want to know about. I have just started walking in the Lord's way and am very immature, so I ask the brothers and sisters for advice to prevent me from taking the wrong way. I would like you to write to me. With respect to the work of the Holy Spirit, I believe that tongue-speaking is something outward. It is more important to be filled inwardly in the aspect of life. The filling of the Holy Spirit includes speaking in tongues, but those who speak in tongues do not always have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit. If I am wrong, please instruct me. Peace in the Lord and greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Kuang-tai<br />April 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-ch'ang, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>We have not seen each other since we parted in Nanking. I really miss you in my heart. Thank the Lord. Although we are physically separated, the fellowship of God cannot be broken. We have been in Nan-ch'ang for four months. Our work is not busy, and we sometimes preach the gospel to the wounded soldiers. Although there is not much fruit, the Lord's word is never in vain. Some have already believed seriously. I know that I am not faithful enough to the Lord. I have let many good opportunities slip away. May God have mercy on me that I would be diligent and zealous for Him. We did not have any meetings until January 16 when the brothers and sisters here met together. We have continued meeting since that date. We have been very encouraged because God has so richly graced us. We sing hymns, pray, exhort, testify and study the Bible together. Thank God for His leading and blessing; we can receive His grace and care at any time and at any place. Sister Chou Yi-mei, Sister Pan Hsueh-mei, and Brother Yu Wei-liang of Chi-Loo University, Shantung, attend the meetings. Brother Chang Jao-tung, Brother Ma Lung-rue, and Brother Hsiao Wen-bing of the Shanghai Medical School also come. Brother Yu Mong-ling, Brother Lin Sung-nien, and Sister Min Guo-jun are in the meetings also. Our unsaved friends sometimes attend too.</p><p>There is one recent occurrence that is worthy of report. Sister Chou's elder brother was a zealous believer at one time, but he drifted away from God because of his environment and situation in recent years. In the beginning he never came to the meetings, but a month ago, Brother Chang prayed for him for quite awhile. We also remembered him in our prayers. He has returned to the Father through God's power and love. Praise God! When a prodigal son returns, even the angels rejoice. We really need the prayers of the brothers and sisters to strengthen us to stand firm before God until the Prince of Peace returns. We mention you constantly in our prayers and ask God to grant you special care. We received news from Shanghai that the meeting was continuing as usual in the hospital. May God bless them there. Dr. Stearn has resigned from the Red Cross Hospital and has taken another job. Do you have any news from Brother Tang Shou-ling? Please greet Brother Liu Kwo-jieh. Greet all the other brothers and sisters in the Lord. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Nan-geng<br />March 27<br />[Address omitted]</p>
