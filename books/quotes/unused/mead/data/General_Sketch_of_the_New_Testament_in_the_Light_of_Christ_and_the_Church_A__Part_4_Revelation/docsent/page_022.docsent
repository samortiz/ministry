   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO BEASTS The Beast out of the Sea Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18 says, And he stood on the sand of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He denotes the dragon, and the sea is the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then 13:1 says, And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This beast, the fourth beast mentioned in Daniel 7:7, is Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8 we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we are told that he will come up out of the sea, as is mentioned also in Daniel 7:3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His spirit, which exists in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations Rev 17:15; Isa 57:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seven heads and ten horns of the beast are those of the dragon Rev 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the beast is one with the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ten horns are the ten coming kings 17:12; Dan 7:24 ; the seven heads are the seven Caesars Rev 17:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ten horns correspond with the ten toes of the great image mentioned in Daniel 2:42-44.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word here indicates that the Roman Empire, Antichrist, and the ten kings are one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 13:2a says, And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Daniel 7:4-6, the leopard, which is characterized by swift and cruel movement, was the symbol of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bear, characterized by its destroying feet, was the symbol of the monarchy of Medo-Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The lion, characterized by its devouring mouth, was a symbol of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in Daniel 7:4-7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the totality of all the evil powers in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation13:2b continues, And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the dragon makes the beast one with him so that on behalf of the dragon the beast can resist God and persecute God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 3 says, And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And the whole earth marveled after the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of his heads refers to one of the Caesars, who will be slain and resuscitated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His death stroke was healed means that the Caesar will be resuscitated from death 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this the whole earth will marvel and follow after him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 13:4 continues, And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And who can make war with him?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 5 says, And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These forty-two months will be the period of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those Christians who fail related to God s purpose will be left to pass through this period.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 6 says, And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tabernacle in heaven includes the raptured believers, who by this time will be in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 7 continues, And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that expositors such as J. N. Darby were incorrect in saying that every saint will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During the forty-two months Antichrist will make war with the saints, that is, those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus 12:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, the dragon will raise up armies to persecute the remnant of the seed of the woman; these are the armies of the beast, the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, Revelation 12 and 13 speak of the same things in two aspects, showing that Satan works together with the Antichrist, the Antichrist cooperates with Satan, and the two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verses 8-10 say, And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 10 once again mentions the saints, those who are left on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under persecution they need endurance and faith.</S>
