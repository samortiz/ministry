   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD OPERATING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 2:13 says, For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The little word for at the beginning of verse 13 connects it to verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that we can work out our own salvation because God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Salvation is the pattern, and God is the One who is operating, working this pattern into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we may say that salvation is God Himself operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Salvation, the pattern, and God are not three separate things; they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The pattern is the salvation, and the salvation is God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we have one thing in three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The pattern is Christ, the God-man who emptied and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Christ, however, is the very God Himself to be the daily salvation for us to work out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, this salvation is actually the God who is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The matter of God operating in us to be our salvation should not be merely a doctrine, but should be something we experience in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Often when a sister is complaining or murmuring, she may sense that something within is constraining her and urging her to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This inner sense comes from God operating in her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If, by God s mercy, she obeys this inner sense, she will experience salvation and be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that, outwardly, objectively, Christ is the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when the pattern works within us, it becomes the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only did Christ die on the cross as our Savior, but now He lives within us as the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as a man was not able to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, as God it is possible for Him to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Christ is both the pattern objectively and the operating God subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once again we see that the pattern, Christ, and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2:13 Paul clearly says that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But elsewhere he usually speaks either of Christ or of the Spirit being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For years I did not understand why in 2:13 Paul spoke of God and not of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now I realize that Paul did this deliberately in order to show us that the Christ who is the pattern for our salvation is the very God operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we consider the context of this verse, we shall see that Christ as the pattern is also the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Objectively, He is the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Subjectively, when He comes into us and operates within us, He is the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the cross, He was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But within us, He is the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the cross He, as Christ, established a pattern for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But within us He, as God, is the operating One to work out this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the pattern is the salvation, and the salvation is the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may experience the operating God daily as our practical salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we cooperate with God operating in us, we enjoy salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s operation becomes our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, this salvation is the reprint, the reproduction, of the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the pattern is reprinted in us, it becomes our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reprinting of the pattern is accomplished by God operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 16 opens with the words, Holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God operates in us, we spontaneously hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fact, the word of life is actually the God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God works in us by His word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He operates in us by being the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have spoken repeatedly of the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we must see that God is embodied in the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the word of life is the embodiment of the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to put this understanding into practice by coming daily to the word of life, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we come to the Word, we should also come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This, however, is not to regard the Bible as God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we should not separate God from His Word, for God is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because God is mysterious, it is difficult for anyone to apprehend Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How we thank Him that He has embodied Himself in the Word, the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Word is the condensation of the invisible and mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many of us can testify from our experience that whenever we come to the Bible and open ourselves, we touch God, and God works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever we touch the word of life, we experience God operating in us, moving in us, to produce a reprint of the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is our practical salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now we can see that Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life are one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, to experience Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life in the way we have described is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>SALVATION THROUGH THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul speaks of salvation both in 1:19 and in 2:12.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1:19 Paul could say that his circumstances would turn out to him for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This indicates that even in his imprisonment Paul enjoyed God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The salvation in 2:12 is the practical salvation which rescues us daily from murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, salvation in both 1:19 and 2:12 is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In both cases salvation is a practical, daily, moment-by-moment salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>According to 1:19, Paul enjoyed salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Apparently, we do not find this bountiful supply in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead, we have the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the bountiful supply of the Spirit and the word of life actually are one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul enjoyed daily salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and we may enjoy daily salvation by the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moreover, Paul says that to enjoy salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit is to magnify Christ and to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same principle, when we enjoy salvation daily through God operating in the word of life, we also live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, to enjoy God s salvation in a practical way is to live Christ, that is, to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to live Christ, we must first take Christ as the living pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we need to obey the operating God within us and receive His word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then spontaneously we shall live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Salvation, Christ, God, and the word of life are four-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Eventually, in our experience, the pattern is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The word of life works out the pattern by the operating God to apply salvation to our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this way we enjoy Christ and live Him.</S>
