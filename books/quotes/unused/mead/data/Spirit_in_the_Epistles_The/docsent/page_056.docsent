   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Mind Being Dependent on the Spirit to Experience Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord, in Romans 8 the mind enters into another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is no longer an independent mind but rather a trusting mind, a dependent mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who has such a mind constantly sets his mind on the spirit and no longer strives by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even when he is very touched after hearing a good message or reading an excellent portion of the Word, his mind is not set on the message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, his mind is set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His mind is not an independent mind but a dependent mind, a mind that trusts absolutely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this time his mind is completely joined to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, he is in union with the spirit, and his soul is completely dependent on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very different from the story of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the fall of man, his soul became independent of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Putting the spirit aside, the soul acts and chooses on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8 is a real salvation because the soul is no longer independent but rather is dependent, relying, and set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dear brothers and sisters, this is the secret to our experiencing the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of life and His subjective salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to set our mind on the spirit, continually be joined with the spirit as one, and never be detached from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians have the concept that our prayer is to receive power from the Lord so that the Lord's power can help us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prayer is not for you to ask the Lord to give you His power objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, prayer is for your independent mind to become a dependent mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more you pray, the more your mind is turned back; hence, it becomes less an independent mind and more a dependent mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our prayer is the calling back of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you pray, the more your mind, which represents you, is turned and set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once your mind is set on the spirit, it is like an electric appliance being plugged into the electrical socket and being connected to the source of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once you are "connected to the source of electricity," salvation comes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit within you begins to carry out the saving work for you to be set free, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and blended.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the key to experiencing the subjective salvation of the Lord as the Spirit of life within us is to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a pity that throughout the years none of the many who expounded the book of Romans and who spoke about the pathway to spirituality were able to point out this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We ourselves also could not point this out ten or twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, however, we have seen clearly that the key to our cooperating with the Lord is to learn to set our mind on the spirit continually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As an illustration, certain brothers are true experts at operating tape recorders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I were to operate them, I might act foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I might try to turn the reels by hand, but that would be a human work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I might try to clean them and make them look very nice, but regardless of how nice they would look, they still would not turn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet these brothers, being very smart, simply put the plugs in the sockets, and the machines begin to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It does not matter if the machines are a little dirty; as long as they are connected to the electricity, they work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, it is the same way with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of how much you try to make yourself proper and well-behaved, even to the extent of not saying one wrong word, this may be due only to your inborn nature or your good upbringing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anyone who is experienced can immediately tell that you are not connected to the Lord inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not you are connected with the Lord does not depend on your broad-mindedness or magnanimity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it depends on where your mind is set.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it is set on the spirit, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these years in the United States, especially in Los Angeles, I pointed out this matter strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The light shone so intensely that many brothers and sisters were delivered in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the objective side, the messages we released in the recent years deal with how God wants Christ to be our life and the church to be the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the subjective side, they first deal with the exercise of our spirit, and second, with setting our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Countless brothers and sisters were blessed and set free in these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our co-workers must pay sufficient attention to this matter and have sufficient experience of it, and then you should go and help the brothers and sisters to know it in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have already enjoyed objective redemption, but today we still need to experience subjective salvation, that is, to experience Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By what way?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In brief, it is by setting the mind continually on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You simply must set your mind continually on your spirit, then the two are connected, and once the connection is made, salvation is here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, setting the mind on the spirit is the way for us to cooperate with the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the Lord has already prepared everything for us, and He is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All that is required is our cooperation, which is to set our mind on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise and thank the Lord, it is enough if you practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You do not need to strive or to exert effort.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is enough just to set your mind on your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Henceforth, you simply walk according to the spirit.</S>
