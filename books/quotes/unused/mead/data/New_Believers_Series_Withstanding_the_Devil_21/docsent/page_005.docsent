   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How to Overcome Satan's Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 12:11 says, "And they the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Him here refers to Satan, who accused the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How do we overcome him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we overcome by the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, when we sin before the Lord, we must confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we must say to Satan, "There is no need for you to accuse me!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I come before the Lord today by the blood of the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To overcome Satan, we must show him that we are forgiven through the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All our sins, major or minor, have been forgiven through the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Word of God: "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize that the blood of the Lamb is the basis of our forgiveness before God as well as the basis of our acceptance in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be so presumptuous as to think that we are good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither should we be so foolish as to condemn ourselves from morning to evening.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is foolish to be proud, and it is also foolish to keep looking at oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who consider themselves to be good are foolish, and those who are blind to the saving power of the Lord are foolish as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who believe in their own power are foolish, and those who do not believe in the Lord's power are foolish as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must see that the blood of the Lamb has already fulfilled all the demands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It has also overcome all the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, we overcome because of the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This word of our testimony declares the spiritual facts; it declares the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must tell Satan, "There is no need for you to trouble me!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My sins have been forgiven through the Lord's blood!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to exercise our faith to declare that Jesus is Lord and that He has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to speak out the word of our testimony and let Satan hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must not only believe in our hearts but also declare it to Satan with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, we must not love our soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The blood of the Lamb" and "the word of their testimony" spoken of previously are two conditions for victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The refusal to love one's soul-life even unto death is an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter what Satan is doing, even if he is putting us to death, our attitude should be such that we still trust in the blood of the Lamb and still declare His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan's accusation will stop if we stand fast in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He cannot overcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we will surely overcome him!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers and sisters receive so much accusation from Satan that they can no longer discern whether it is an accusation from Satan or a reproach of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should stop confessing their sins for a while; the Lord does not want us to do things foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, they should pray to the Lord and say, "If I have sinned, I will confess my sins and ask for Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But now I am under Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I pray that You cover all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this point on, everything is under Your blood, and I will not be bothered by anything anymore, whether it be sin or otherwise!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are in such a condition must forget about everything for a while before they can differentiate clearly between Satan's accusation and the Holy Spirit's reproach.</S>
