   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE MEETING TO EXHIBIT CHRIST IN HIS VICTORY Scripture Reading: Exo 5:1; 10:9; 23:14; Psa 42:4; 122:1; Acts 2:46-47; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, thank You for this gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How we thank You for all the churches with all the saints in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, this gathering is a testimony of Your victory over us, even over the enemy in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we trust in You for instant utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have no decision as to what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We trust in You for Your living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Touch our heart and visit our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, even open up our sober mind that we all may see something on Your heart, that we may see something according to Your plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Your precious name we claim, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the summer training I began to consider the matter of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I have been considering this, I believe some new light, even new lights, have come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As you can see from the title of the message, what we would say is not something so usual concerning the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we would see that the meeting is to exhibit Christ in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you ever asked when the meeting life began in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most of you, after thinking a little bit, might say that the meeting life began from Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But you have to realize that the meeting life began much earlier than this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The meeting on the day of Pentecost was just a continuation of the meeting which began centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When did God s people begin to meet together?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Could you find some meeting of God s people in the book of Genesis?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At most you may find a kind of family reunion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In all of the fifty chapters of Genesis there is no meeting, no assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was no gathering of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when you come to the second book of the Bible, Exodus, there was the meeting of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus when God s salvation was brought in, right away there was the demand of the assembly of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was the request to meet together, and this request goes along with God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a sense God didn t save any individuals or even a bunch of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God saved an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Feast unto the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, according to the appearance of the wording in Exodus, you couldn t find a word like assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet when God called Moses and sent him to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt, He spoke in this way: And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My people is collective; it is not just one person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a collective people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses was to tell Pharaoh to let God s people go to hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to realize that the thought of assembling, the thought of gathering, is implied in this word feast.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe we all know that there is no possibility to have a feast if there is only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is difficult to have a feast by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may buy some chicken and some pie and some other things and try to have a feast by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is hard to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even to have a feast with your wife and children is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Still there is not that much of a feast flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more people you have, the more flavor you have of a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A feast is a kind of assembled eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to assemble people together for eating, and this eating implies an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So a feast implies two things: eating and assembling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is hard to say which may be considered first and which second: eating or assembling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But anyhow these are the two factors that constitute a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without eating there is not a feast; without assembling there is not a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A feast needs eating and assembling; it needs assembling and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means to eat by assembling in front of God and also with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a feast for the people but unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Way of God s Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now you can see the requirements of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first requirement is to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to this principle you cannot receive God s salvation without joining the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the typology in Exodus God did not save any individuals; God saved a people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And this people ate together and assembled together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That was their keeping of a feast unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They enjoyed the eating by the assembling, but they did this not only for themselves, but mainly unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was the way of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the Day of Pentecost</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even on the day of Pentecost, it was a people and not individuals who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the principle of the first mentioning in the Bible, the first instance of God s salvation at Pentecost was not a saving of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was a saving of a people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Right after they were saved, they all assembled together Acts 2:46-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you study the book of Acts carefully you will see that all the people who were saved on the day of Pentecost stuck themselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Not only did they stay together, they also stuck themselves one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Their sticking together was a testimony of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That testimony scared the people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Acts 5:13 tells us that other people dared not to join them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I was a small child, the first time I saw an army I was scared to death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I dared not go close to that army.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That was terrifying!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do believe that on the day of Pentecost, the first meeting of the church was very terrifying.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Of course, in those days they met nearly the whole day and every day, and whenever they met that was a testimony of the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was a testimony of Christ s victory in them over the enemy, over Satan, over the world, over all the demons!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The first point of the new light concerning the meetings is this: the meeting life of God s people began in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Don t think the meeting life of God s people began in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What transpired in Acts was a continuation of that meeting which began in Exodus centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even the meeting place was not changed!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The New Testament people of God met in the same temple where the Old Testament people of God had met.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The meeting in the temple was a continuation of the assembly of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Properly speaking, God s people began to meet at Mount Sinai.</S>
