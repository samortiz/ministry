<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PROPER EATING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 10:23&mdash;11:1</h1><p>In 10:23&mdash;11:1 we have the conclusion of the section on the eating of idol sacrifices. In these verses Paul speaks of the proper eating.</p><p>In dealing with the matter of eating, Paul&rsquo;s thought is very profound. Using the history of the children of Israel as a background, Paul wrote to the Corinthian believers in an urgent way. His composition indicates a sense of urgency. There is also the indication that he did not have the time to cover everything in detail.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING AND ENJOYMENT</h2><p>We have seen that Paul likens our enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s table to the enjoyment of those Israelites who ate the sacrifices and who thus were fellowshippers of the altar (v. 18). We need to be impressed with the fact that eating is related to enjoyment. If our enjoyment is of something other than Christ, then in the sight of God that enjoyment is idolatry. We need to simplify and purify our enjoyment so that we enjoy only the Lord Himself.</p><p>Christ is the Lord and He is also the table. When we say that Jesus Christ is Lord, we mean that He is everything. As our everything, He is our table. The table is typified by the good land, which was a table to the children of Israel. When they dwelt in the good land, they feasted on the table, enjoying all the rich produce of the land. The various aspects of the produce of the land are types of the riches of Christ. Furthermore, Christ Himself is to us the good land as the table. If we see this picture clearly, we shall know how to enjoy the Lord as the good land with all the riches.</p><p>We have given many messages on the riches of Christ, especially a series printed in the book <i>The All-Inclusive Christ.</i>We also had much to say concerning Christ&rsquo;s riches in the Life-studies of Colossians and Philippians. I encourage the saints to read these messages and to lay hold of the items of the riches of Christ. Then these riches will become the foodstuffs for our enjoyment.</p><p>In 10:23 Paul says, &ldquo;All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient; all things are lawful, but not all things build up.&rdquo; Verses 14 through 22 deal with eating idol sacrifices from the aspect of not making oneself one with demons. From verse 23 through 11:1 this matter is dealt with from the view of building up others to the glory of God (v. 31).</p><p>The first part of verse 23 is identical to the first part of 6:12. The Greek word rendered lawful literally means under my power; hence, permissible, allowable, lawful. The word for expedient means profitable (not merely convenient), advantageous, good, or worthwhile. The parallel verse, 6:12, ends with not being brought under the power of anything. This verse ends with not building up. The former concerns ourselves; the latter, others. In 6:12 Paul&rsquo;s concern is personal, but in 10:23 it is corporate.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR PRINCIPLES</h2><p>If we put together 6:12 and 10:23 and 31, we have four principles concerning the believers&rsquo; walk. First, all things are lawful to the believers, but all the things they do must be expedient. This means that the things must be profitable, that is, not causing the suffering of any loss. Second, the believers must not be brought under the power of anything. Third, all things the believers do must build up others. Fourth, whatever the believers do, they must do to the glory of God (10:31). Fully aware of these principles, Paul goes on to say in 10:24, &ldquo;Let no one seek his own profit, but that of another.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">ASKING NO QUESTIONS FOR CONSCIENCE&rsquo; SAKE</h2><p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;Everything sold in a meat market eat, asking no question for conscience&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; At the apostle&rsquo;s time, usually only a part of the sacrifices to idols were consumed as an offering. The rest was given to the priests or to the poor, or sold again in the market. Buyers might unknowingly purchase meat that had been offered to idols. Thus, when someone went to the market to purchase meat, he might buy meat which had been used in sacrifice to idols. Regarding this, Paul tells the believers to ask no questions for the sake of conscience. This means that they should not ask questions about the meat, but simply buy it and eat it.</p><p>In verse 26 Paul continues, &ldquo;For the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s and the fullness of it.&rdquo; Fullness here means the riches and also the expression. All the riches of the earth are its fullness, its expression.</p><p>In verse 27 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; On such an occasion, the believers should not investigate the situation. There is no need to ask questions. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Paul continues, &ldquo;if anyone should say to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out and for conscience&rsquo; sake; conscience, I say, not your own, but the other&rsquo;s&rdquo; (vv. 28-29a). Should someone point out that the meat has been offered in sacrifice to idols, then the believers were to refrain from eating for the sake of the conscience of the one who has pointed out this fact.</p><p>In the second part of verse 29 and verse 30 Paul asks, &ldquo;For why is my freedom judged by another&rsquo;s conscience? If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of concerning that for which I give thanks?&rdquo; The word partake in verse 30 denotes eating. This clearly indicates that eating is partaking (v. 17). Here &ldquo;evil spoken of&rdquo; means criticized with an evil purpose. If a believer is criticized in this way for eating meat sacrificed to idols, he should refrain from eating that meat.</p><p>In verse 31 Paul concludes, &ldquo;Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&rdquo; The word therefore in this verse indicates that 10:31 through 11:1 is a conclusion to this subsection, which began with verse 23.</p><p>I wish to say again that 6:12 and 10:23 and 31 give us four basic principles for regulating the conduct of the New Testament believers. All things are lawful, but whatever we do must be, as to the thing itself, profitable; as to ourselves, not brought under the power of anything; as to others, building them up; and as to God, glorifying Him. Otherwise, nothing is permissible or acceptable. If a certain matter does not pass the test of these four principles, we should not do it.</p>
