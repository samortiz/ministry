   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BEING PREJUDICED TOWARD OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BASED ON OUR DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, we must not allow our disposition to prejudice us toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a problem that is very damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a great problem for a co-worker to like one type of saint and dislike another type of saint.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not like or dislike anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must transcend our personal feelings, and we must spend time to observe the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wrong for us to like a saint who suits our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I do not like talkative people, I can easily like a saint who does not speak much, whether or not he functions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, there may be a talkative saint who does not suit my disposition but whose function has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which saint should I spend time to perfect?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I should perfect both.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of the co-workers often said that there is no one for him to perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, there are saints whom he can work on, but they just are not according to his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He thinks that they are not qualified; therefore, he puts them aside and will not perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a basic problem among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perfecting the saints and producing useful ones are the responsibility of both the co-workers and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The co-workers, the elders, and the responsible ones in the districts and the other serving saints must not be afraid of the trouble or difficulties involved in perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They must also transcend their feelings by teaching and accommodating the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without such a spirit we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is wrong to think that no one is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever we are, we must work to the extent that even the saints who seemingly have no capacity become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must make use of every kind of material; we must perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must coordinate, use the environment, and produce useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In some places the co-workers and elders are capable, but they work as though the saints cannot be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must not allow such a situation to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should let the saints serve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of these saints will even do a better job than what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is intolerable for us to hold the saints down.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In particular, the co-workers and elders should never be so careless as to hold the saints down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if we are capable, we should train others and not hold them down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the work and in the church we are not measured by whether or not we are capable; we are measured by how many useful ones we are able to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The standard of success does not depend on our ability to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The standard is determined by how many useful ones we can produce.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My ability to serve is not the standard; the standard is whether I can perfect another saint to do better than me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This requires that we learn our lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work and the church are progressing very slowly because we do not serve with the saints in order to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, we seldom coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who have some capacity are passive, and they yield to others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The position of the senior elders and the co-workers is not the important issue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our concept must be changed, and the system must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The senior elders will continue to serve as elders, but they should not limit or hinder the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, the middle-aged saints should be brought into the eldership to assist the senior elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This would be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must not keep things in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be willing to hand things over to other saints and to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then those who are younger will be raised up by the Lord to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning this point, our concept must change, and our system must change.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not just a matter of having a new way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is altogether a matter of changing our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When both the co-workers and the elders begin to perfect the saints, our coordination will become effective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
