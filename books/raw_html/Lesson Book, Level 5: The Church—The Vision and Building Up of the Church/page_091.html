<h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>Oneness is crucial for Christ, the perfecting gifts, and the perfected saints to build up the Body of Christ. If there is no oneness, it is impossible to build up the Body of Christ. Christ is not divided. He has only one Body; therefore, everyone who is related to the building up of the one Body of Christ must be in oneness. Oneness is different from unity. Unity is outward. Different people with different purposes and opinions may try to unite themselves in organizations like the United Nations or labor unions. But they are not one. Oneness is inward, it is of the same essence and nature. Out of this inward oneness comes the outward one accord expressed in the way people act and move. By the intrinsic oneness and the outward practice of the one accord, Christ the Head, the perfecting gifts, and the perfected saints will build up the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD BEING ONE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. In His Essence</h2><p>There is only one God (1 Cor. 8:4; Isa. 45:5; Psa. 86:10). He has three aspects—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). Though He has the aspect of three, nevertheless, He is one God. The Father, Son, and Spirit may be distinct yet never separate. Though they coexist from eternity to eternity, they coinhere, living within one another. You can never find the Father without the Son in Him, neither can you find the Son without the Father in Him, nor can you find the Spirit without the Father and the Son. All three are one; thus, God is called the Triune God. God is one in essence and cannot be divided.<h2 class=head2>B. In His Purpose</h2><p>God is one in His purpose. God, the Triune God—Father, Son, and Spirit—has one purpose. The purpose of God is to build up the church to express Him and to satisfy Him.<h2 class=head2>C. In His Economy</h2><p>God is also one in His economy. God’s economy is to work Himself—Father, Son, and Spirit—into His chosen, created, redeemed, and regenerated people so that they may be filled with Him, be transformed, and be built up into the one Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>D. In His Acts</h2><p>The one God accomplished many things to work out His economy. You can see the principle of oneness, which is according to God’s nature of oneness, in everything He did. He created one universe. He created one earth for His purpose out of hundreds of billions of galaxies and stars. God needs billions of people for His purpose, yet He created only one man. He did not create a woman. Out of this one man, He built a woman. From this one couple came billions of people.<p>During the flood, He saved one family, Noah’s family. He selected and called one man, Abraham, to be the head of one chosen race. He used one man, Moses, to bring His one people out of Egypt at one time. He desired one tabernacle for the children of Israel to worship Him. He brought them into one good land at one time and required them to fight together in oneness. He required His people to worship Him at one place—the one temple in one city, Jerusalem.<p>In order to have a new creation, He was first incarnated as one man, Jesus. Out of the death and resurrection of this one Man, He created one new man, the church. Ultimately, the church will become the one and only New Jerusalem for eternity.<p>You can see that our God is one in Himself, in His purpose, in His economy, and in His acts. Because He is in oneness, His operating principle is oneness, His actions are in oneness, and His finished work is in oneness; therefore, the way to build up the church must be in oneness.
