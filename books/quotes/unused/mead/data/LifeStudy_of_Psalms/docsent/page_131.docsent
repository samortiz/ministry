   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASKING GOD TO DEAL WITH HIS ENEMIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Psalm 35 David asked God to deal with his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Begging God to Fight</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His Enemies with Weapons</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, he begged God to fight his enemies with weapons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 1 says, "Strive, O Jehovah, with those who strive with me;/Battle against those who battle against me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you believe that God desires such a prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not according to the Lord's teaching in the New Testament, which tells us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 2-3 say, "Take hold of shield and buckler,/And rise up as my help./Draw out also the spear, and close up the way/Against those who pursue me;/Say to my soul,/I am your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of asking God for something, David here is teaching God how to deliver him by fighting against his enemies with weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 4-8 say, "Let those who seek my life/Be put to shame and humiliated;/Let those who devise evil for me/Be turned back and confounded./Let them be like chaff before the wind,/With the angel of Jehovah driving them on./Let their way be darkness and slipperiness itself,/With the angel of Jehovah pursuing them./For without cause they hid their net for me in a pit;/Without cause they dug a hole for me./Let destruction come upon them unawares,/And let his net, which he hid, catch him;/Let him fall into it, into destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is this a spiritual prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this prayer comes out of a man who is fully in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament economy, a spiritual person could never ask God to come with a shield, with a buckler, and with a spear to fight against his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. Boasting in His Trusting in God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and in His Well-dealing with</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those Who Mistreated Him</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 9-16 David boasted in his trusting in God and in his well-dealing with those who mistreated him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses say, "Then my soul will exult in Jehovah;/It will rejoice in His salvation./All my bones will say,/Jehovah, who is like You,/Who delivers an afflicted one from him who is too strong for him,/And an afflicted and needy one from him who robs him?/Malicious witnesses rise up;/They ask me about things I know nothing of./They repay me evil for good;/I am bereaved in soul./But I, when they were sick,/Had sackcloth as my clothing;/I afflicted my soul with fasting,/And my prayer returned to my own bosom./I conducted myself as if it had been my friend or my brother; /Like one mourning for his mother, I bowed down gloomily./But at my stumbling they rejoice and gather together;/The dregs whom I had not known/Gather together against me; /They tear at me and do not cease./As profane mocking parasites,/They gnash their teeth at me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The above verses show that in David's consideration his enemies were very bad, whereas he was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His expressions in these verses display too much self-righteousness.</S>
