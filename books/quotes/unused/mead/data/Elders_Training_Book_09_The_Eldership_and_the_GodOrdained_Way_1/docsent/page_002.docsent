   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE WAY TO CARRY OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD'S NEW MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to make the Lord's new move and the way to carry out His move clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, I would like to mention something about what the Lord's recovery has gone through in the past sixty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our beginning in the Lord's recovery was very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was because we were new and young, and Christianity was prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, the Lord was merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He gave us a heart to seek after Him, after His Word, after His truth, and after His way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By His mercy we were absolute in our desire to drop the traditional, unscriptural way of Christianity and simply take the Lord Himself, His gospel, and His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we did not clearly see the right way to carry out what the Lord had shown us concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We mostly went to the writings of the Brethren for help concerning the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As young men, we had no choice except to discerningly follow those writings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, we found that the practice of the Brethren was neither absolutely scriptural nor adequate to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>RECOVERING THE PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both Brother Nee and I came out from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee's grandfather was a pastor, and my mother was a third generation Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We studied in Christian schools.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the Lord's mercy, we began to meet outside of Christianity to have the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we had come out of Christianity, we realized that we still unintentionally maintained some parts of the practice of Christianity as a kind of unconscious tradition in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the natural concept, a Christian meeting must be a meeting with a large congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, according to the principle of Matthew 18:20, only two or three are required for a Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nearly all of the local churches began with a small number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, many churches began with not more than five saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spontaneously, these localities grew to a larger number.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually in 1948, Brother Nee began to say that the Lord's Day morning meeting among us was not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He uttered his strong feeling definitely to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He indicated strongly that we should stop the Lord's Day morning meetings and spend that time to preach the gospel see Church Affairs chapter four .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He told us that our way of meeting was altogether not according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He pointed out to us that the most clear word in the New Testament concerning the way the believers should meet is in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He especially stressed verse 26, which says that when we come together, all of us should have something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also pointed out that the proper Christian meeting should be fully in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that the Lord's Day message meeting with one speaking and the rest listening was according to the "customs of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament, God warned the children of Israel that when they entered the good land, they should not follow the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8; Lev 18:3; Deut 18:9 NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee compared all the denominations to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The children of Israel followed the nations, but today we are following the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To have one speaking and the rest listening on the Lord's Day morning is a custom of the fallen denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we take this way, we are like the children of Israel who followed the customs of the nations, and this is serious in the Lord's eyes.</S>
