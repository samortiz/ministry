Our attitude alone cannot replace God's work. Perhaps after some brothers and sisters hear a message on the cross, they change their attitude. They may say, "In the future I have to learn to be more humble and gentle before God. In the future when I work, I have to learn to rely on Him more." Even this does not mean they have the sign of death. We need to realize that the cross is God's work upon us. One day the Lord will enlighten us in His mercy, and through this enlightening, we will be crushed and an eternal mark will be left upon us. From that day on, we may still move, but every time we move, we will feel the pain and the absence of strength. A day will come when the cross does its work on us, and we will no longer please God according to our flesh.</p><p>Therefore, it is useless to have a mere change in our attitude; what is needed is the true experience of the cross. A person may try to change his attitude, but it will not last long, and he will soon forget the change. When something happens he will become bold in himself again. When others say a few words of praise to him, his face will shine again. When his work is making good progress, he will feel as if he is treading on the clouds again. Have you seen this? What is the use of having just a change in attitude? It is useless to have the attitude of the cross without the experience of the cross. There must first be the experience of the cross before there can be the attitude of the cross. Paul said, "And I was...in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). He was a person who knew the cross, so he could have the attitude of the cross. If we pretend to be in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling, this will go away in a few days and be forgotten even by ourselves. It is easy for us to have the right attitude and the right message, without the experience of the cross. When this happens, we will easily forget about the whole matter after some time. Once a brother said, "I used to preach the cross, but for some unknown reason I have not touched this subject for the last ten months." Is this surprising? No. If it is only a subject, it will soon be forgotten. If God has done a work on me and touched me, I will spontaneously become a weak person. I will not have to try to be a weak person; I will be weak. I will not have to imitate Paul and be in fear and trembling; I will be in fear and trembling. There will be a sign of the cross on me, and I will be changed into another person. This is having an offering before God, and this is pleasing to God.</p><p>This was the experience of Jacob at Peniel. He limped because his thigh was crippled, and he remained this way for the rest of his life. Yet many Christians do not suffer a wound after falling. They fall repeatedly, but after getting up they can still run. Before they fall they are one kind of person, and after they rise up they are still the same kind of person. But when the cross does its work on such a person, he will fall and not be able to get up again. When he finally gets up, no matter how hard he tries, he will not act the same way as before; there will be an indelible mark on him. From that point on, even if he wants to be great, he will be unable to try. A Christian who is truly touched by God finds no heart for his own idea; he cannot be proud even if he tries. God has done a work in him, and he makes his offering through this work. This is the meaning of death, and this is the meaning of the cross.</p><p>In conclusion, we must repeat that the cross is not a mere doctrine or teaching; it is God's enlightenment. Once God enlightens us, we can no longer live as we did before. This is the cross. Men like Peter, John, and Paul in the New Testament and Job, Jacob, Daniel, Isaiah, and Ezekiel in the Old Testament all experienced a one-time intense enlightening from God. After they saw the light, they could no longer live as they did before, and their lives could never be the same. This is the cross. When God's light exposes the self, we will no longer live the same way. This is the cross. We will realize that nothing from ourselves pleases God and that we can only prostrate ourselves before Him. This is the cross. Then we will serve God according to this cross, not serving by the flesh and not trusting in our own works; we will serve by the Holy Spirit and trust in God's life. May the Lord deliver us from mere doctrines, and may the cross truly work on us so that we may make an offering which is acceptable to Him and become a person who is acceptable to Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
