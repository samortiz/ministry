   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHEPHERDING AND MINISTERING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever a matter pertaining to the service is put in your hand, do not organize anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead, exercise your spirit to pray and to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The best shepherding takes place in the context of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this is that all the leaders of the service groups spontaneously are shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in practice, many of the leaders have functioned as organizers, not as shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy to organize, but to shepherd requires considerable exercise of spirit, patience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It also demands that we minister life to others, even to those who are not so open.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not neglect the ones you regard as useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is your responsibility to care for them, to make them living, and to help them to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, you need to make them useful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not come by organizing; it comes by praying, shepherding, nourishing, and ministering life to them with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not concentrate on the ones you think are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, pay attention to the ones who seem to be useless ones, even the worldly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The right way is to care for a certain worldly one, ministering life to him, until a transformation has taken place in him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not the way of organizing; it is the way of shepherding by praying and ministering life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some elders and co-workers still have the concept and attitude that they cannot do anything with those who do not seem to be promising.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes I have asked the elders in certain places why they have not produced any useful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason for the lack is that they have not trained anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Forty years ago, in my home town of Chefoo we trained the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were like carpenters making furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we could not obtain the best wood, we used whatever wood was available.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And if there was no wood, we used cardboard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, if we do not have the most qualified people, we should train the people we have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a carpenter knows his trade, he will be able to make tables out of almost any material.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be like this in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BEARING THE TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have seen that the Levites between the ages of thirty and fifty were the ones who bore the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were qualified both in age and in training.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To bear the testimony is to have the actual church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither the fighting on the frontier nor the taking care of the young ones is the direct service of the testimony, the direct church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, in order to keep the church life, we need both the fighting and the caring for the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those fighting on the frontier keep the enemy away, and the little ones, forming a wall around the tabernacle, maintain the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But those typified by the Levites between the ages of thirty and fifty carry on the direct church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With them are a number of learners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A great many people are needed for the Lord's testimony, all of whom are for the tabernacle either directly or indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Presently we are seriously lacking those who know how to care for the tabernacle in a fine way in order to carry the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Lord's recovery we need a group of experienced ones who have been trained to bear the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not here as part of Christianity; neither are we here to be another denomination or independent group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this, we must be serious with the Lord and go on with Him according to our age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then a strong testimony will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There will be a clear testimony to the Christians, to the unbelievers, and to the principalities and powers in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall be able to testify to all that the Lord has fulfilled His prophecy in Matthew 16:18 concerning the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The clear picture of the type in the Old Testament helps us to see what we need today.</S>
