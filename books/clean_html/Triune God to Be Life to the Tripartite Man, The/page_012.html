<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Accomplishing God's Redemption and<br>Releasing His Divine Life through<br>His Death on the Cross</H2><P>Through His death on the cross, Christ accomplished God's redemption and released His divine life. These two things are signified by the shedding of His blood and by the flowing of water out of Him (John 19:34). Christ came through incarnation, and His death and resurrection were a continuation of His journey in incarnation. What was the destination of His journey? The destination of the Triune God's journey through incarnation is man's spirit. Unless the Triune God reaches our spirit, He has not arrived at His destination. In order to reach this destination, the Triune God had to pass through human living, death, and resurrection. Through death He accomplished redemption. We needed redemption because we could not meet the threefold requirement of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness. As long as God's requirements are unsatisfied, God has no way to enter into us. Through the redemption of Christ, God's glory, holiness, and righteousness were satisfied. This is the negative side of Christ's death, signified by the shedding of His blood (John 19:34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Through His Resurrection,<br>Christ as the Last Adam<br>Becoming the Life-giving,<br>Life-dispensing Spirit</H2><P>Christ's death released His divine life, signified by the water flowing out of Him (John 19:34). This is the positive side of Christ's death. His divine life could be released from within the shell of His humanity (John 12:24) only by death and resurrection. In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is ready to enter into our spirit. When we call, "O Lord Jesus," He immediately arrives at the destination of our spirit. Our spirit is the destination of His journey.</P><P>Christ has taken several steps in His journey through incarnation to be man's life. His first step was to enter into the womb of a virgin (Matt. 1:23). His second step was to come out of that womb to be a God-man. His third step was to walk on the earth in His human living. The goal of such a walk is the spirit of man. But in order to enter into the spirit of man, Christ had to die on the cross to redeem man, and He had to rise from among the dead to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the Spirit, He can enter into man. When man calls upon the name of the Lord, He arrives at His destination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Whoever Believes into Christ<br>Having the Eternal Divine Life</H2><P>Christ's becoming the life-giving, life-dispensing Spirit is the last step of His coming to man. Now only one thing is needed: we must believe into Him in order to have eternal life (John 3:16, 36a; 20:31). The way to believe into Him is to call upon His name (Rom. 10:9, 13). When we call upon His name, He enters into us immediately. He enters into us and we enter into Him. Our believing brings Him into our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:10), which is the destination of His journey.</P>
