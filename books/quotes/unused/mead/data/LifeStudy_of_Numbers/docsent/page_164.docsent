   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>26-27 .</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering of Jehovah" v. 29 . Because Eleazar the priest was one with Jehovah, whatever was given to Jehovah as a tribute by the fighters went to Eleazar the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What was given to Eleazar became a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies that the tribute was put into ascension for a memorial before Jehovah and that this eventually became the high priest's portion.</S>
