   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Always Remember:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is No Way for the Members</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Body of Christ to be Legitimately Divided</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must always remember that there is no way for the members of the Body of Christ to be legitimately divided in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, no division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All Problems Can and Should Be Solved</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>through Proper and Adequate Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>by Praying Together Sincerely and Thoroughly</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All problems can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any question and any problem can be solved by fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 15 speaks of how the trouble concerning circumcision came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That stirred up a big turmoil in the church at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul and Barnabas, however, did not say, "This is something from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let Jerusalem take care of this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will tell these people to go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Antioch is our territory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is in our jurisdiction."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is not the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, Paul and Barnabas went from Antioch to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They all came together to have a thorough fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this kind of adequate and thorough fellowship, they arrived at a conclusion by the leading and guidance of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, they solved the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we should be the same, but those who have been dissenting among us did not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In recent years there have been some turmoils among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the dissenting ones came to me, a proposal was made to invite all the leading co-workers and the leading elders throughout the globe to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We would all come together to pray thoroughly, and then we would open up the holy Word to study and fellowship about all the concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They told me that they would agree on a date which would be acceptable for everyone to come together, and then they would let me know.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, however, this never took place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That means they rejected the proper way to have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus far, none of the dissenting ones have come to me with a spirit of fellowship to fellowship about their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have to learn that if we see something that we cannot tolerate, the best way is to have fellowship with the concerned ones and with some experienced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By praying together to search the Word, we can solve every problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we all hold to the unique faith, there should be no problem among us that cannot be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all believe that God is triune and that the Bible is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also believe that Christ is God becoming a man to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He died on the cross for our sins and He resurrected physically, psychologically, and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today He is our Savior and our life, and we are the children of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we believe in the contents of the faith, we should not contend for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to argue with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we need to fellowship by praying together.</S>
