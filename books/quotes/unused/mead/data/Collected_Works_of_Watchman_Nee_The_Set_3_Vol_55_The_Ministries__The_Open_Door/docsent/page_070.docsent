   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Impossibility of Having It Both Ways</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people have a wrong thought.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They agree that the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is locality, yet because they are unwilling to get out of the sects, they think that the house is also a boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think the two can go together side by side without contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They cannot distinguish when the house is the same as the locality and when the house is different from the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the house is the same as the locality, it can be the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the house is different from the locality, the two cannot be the boundary, the unit, of the church at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The key rests with locality, whether or not the house equals the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the house is the unit, then locality, which is bigger than the house, cannot be the unit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can locality be the unit if it can be divided into smaller units?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we acknowledge locality as the unit, how can we also acknowledge the house as a unit?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since locality is the smallest unit, how can it be divided into smaller units such as houses?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that those who promote "house" churches do not view the word house scripturally; that is, they do not consider house in the context that locality and house are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, they view the house according to their own concept, making it smaller than locality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not the kind of house spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a foot is one unit of measure, then an inch is not sufficient to be the unit, because it is less than a full unit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we take an inch to be the unit, a foot can no longer be the unit, because a foot equals twelve units.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, if the unit for the church is locality, then the many houses in one locality cannot be many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One locality with one house has but one church; one locality with one hundred houses also has but one church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With one hundred houses there are not one hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the house is the unit, then there is one church with one house, and there are one hundred churches with one hundred houses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this case a locality with one hundred houses could never have only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two, house and locality, are completely different units.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Either we take the house as the unit or locality as the unit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There must be a unit, but we cannot have both.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The house and the locality cannot both be units for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the locality is the unit, then 1 a united church of several localities joined together is wrong, and 2 isolated divisions within one locality are also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the house is the unit, then 1 the united church is still wrong, but 2 the divisions in each locality are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the divisions within a locality can hide behind the word house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the "house" is the unit, all who refuse "to hear the church" Matt 18:17 can organize separate "house" churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The "house" church becomes a shelter to all the divisive ones in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord be merciful to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we must be clear that there can be only one unit either house or locality, not both of them together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Similarly, if our salvation is not by grace, it has to be by works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It cannot be by grace and works; we cannot have both.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Bible, the boundary, the jurisdiction, of the church is the locality, just as our salvation is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dividing the church in a locality into many "house" churches brings divisions into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe God in His great wisdom made the locality the boundary of the church in order to eliminate the works of man, which try to divide the church within one locality.</S>
