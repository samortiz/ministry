<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah<br>Extended to Joshua</H2><P>Zechariah 3:3-10 shows us how the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Removing the Filthy Garments from Him</H2><P>"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel. And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you" (vv. 3-4a). Recently, as I was considering how the high priest could still be clothed with filthy garments, I was reminded how even the believers in the church could steal (Eph. 4:28). We may not steal outwardly, but we may inwardly desire something that belongs to someone else. This is covetousness and greediness. Likewise, every day we speak a lot, and the matters we cover in our talk or gossip may be either dirty or with an evil intention to defame others. This is why we must often pray, "Lord, cleanse me. I realize that I am still filthy because I still live in the flesh, which is altogether filthy."</P><P>The Angel of Jehovah knew all the things concerning Joshua and did not give Satan any time to accuse. In such a situation Joshua may not have been at peace. Satan was beside him, the dirty garments were upon him, and the Angel of Jehovah was before him. However, the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua by removing the filthy garments from him, thus making his iniquity pass from him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Clothing Him with Stately Robes</H2><P>Not only did Joshua's iniquity pass from him, but he was also clothed with "stately robes" (vv. 4b, 5b). A stately robe is a garment that is fitting to one's office and status. For example, judges are clothed with stately robes. Likewise, Joshua was clothed with garments befitting his office and status as high priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Crowning Him with a Clean Turban upon His Head</H2><P>"And I said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by" (v. 5). This clean turban signifies that Joshua had been fully cleansed and was now clean in the presence of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</P>
