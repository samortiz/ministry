<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CONCERNING THE BREAKING<br>OF THE YOKE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR,<br>THE KING OF BABYLON,<br>AND THE BRINGING BACK OF THE VESSELS<br>OF THE HOUSE OF JEHOVAH AND ALL THE EXILES FROM JUDAH TO BABYLON</H2><P>The prophecies in chapter twenty-eight concern the breaking of the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and the bringing back of the vessels of the house of Jehovah and all the exiles from Judah to Babylon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The False Prophecy<br>of Hananiah, the Son of Azzur</H2><P>Verses 1 through 11 deal with the false prophecy of Hananiah, the son of Azzur.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Saying That Jehovah Would Break<br>the Yoke of the King of Babylon<br>from All the Nations within Two Years</H2><P>Hananiah, the son of Azzur, prophesied falsely that within two years Jehovah would break the yoke of the king of Babylon from all the nations, as demonstrated by Hananiah's taking the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and breaking it (vv. 2, 10-11). This false prophecy involved not only speaking but also a demonstration. Jeremiah had put on a yoke to indicate that the people of Israel would be put under the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar. In demonstrating his false prophecy, Hananiah took the yoke from Jeremiah and broke it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Saying That within Two Years<br>Jehovah Would Bring Back<br>All the Vessels of the House of Jehovah<br>and All the Exiles Who Went to Babylon</H2><P>In his false prophecy, Hananiah also said that within two years Jehovah would bring back to the holy land all the vessels of the house of Jehovah and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon (vv. 3-4).</P>
