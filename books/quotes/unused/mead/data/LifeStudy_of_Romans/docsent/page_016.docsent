   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Obeying the Laws of Nature</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Next, we need to do things according to our nature 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people are so spiritual that they condemn everything natural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They seem to feel that nothing natural can be good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense, I agree with this almost completely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In another sense, however, I would caution you against forgetting our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our original nature, as created by God, was good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything created by our Father, including our nature, was good originally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, our nature was poisoned by the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There can be no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, as human beings, we have a nature which God created good, and we need to act according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should take heed to this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although you may argue that it is not wrong to steal from others, the nature within you protests whenever you are tempted to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even bank robbers will admit that, as they rob banks, their nature tells them, Don t do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, they will not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the same with every evil-doer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever they do something wrong, their nature disagrees.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to observe the requirements of the nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Romans 2:14-15 Paul says that when the nations who do not have the law practice the things of the law, they prove that the function of the law is written in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law of God has a function in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, our nature corresponds to God s law because our nature was made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s law was given according to God s nature, for a lawgiver always enacts a law in accordance with his own being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created man according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the law given by God and the man created by God correspond to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we do not need an outward law because we have the function of the law written in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We simply need to live according to our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Listening to the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Along with our good nature, we also have a conscience 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The conscience is a wonderful entity, and we should listen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although medical doctors cannot locate it, no one can deny that we possess it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our conscience protests continually.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you argue with your parents, the conscience says, Don t do this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you offend your parents, your conscience will trouble you for three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every husband seeking to divorce his wife will also be convicted by his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All men have a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the normal Christian life we must all take care of our conscience in a suitable way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Caring for the Proper Reasonings</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition to our nature and our conscience, we have the reasonings in our mind 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not be so spiritual to say that our mind is absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our mind we have the good reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes these reasonings accuse and condemn, and other times they excuse and justify.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Often, as we set out to do a certain thing, we experience a conflict in our reasonings, with some reasonings saying, Yes, that s right, and others saying, No, that s wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have all experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to take care of our nature, our conscience, and the reasonings within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen the five items in the way of restriction: knowing God by His creation, holding the truth of God in righteousness, living according to our nature, listening to our conscience, and caring for our proper reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we observe all these things, we will be restricted from every kind of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we all are saved and are living somewhere in Romans 5 through 8, we still need to know the source of evil and the way to be restricted from doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah, we have found it!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to know God by His creation and hold His truth in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to act according to our nature, heed the voice of our conscience, and care for the proper reasonings within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we practice all these things, we will be protected.</S>
