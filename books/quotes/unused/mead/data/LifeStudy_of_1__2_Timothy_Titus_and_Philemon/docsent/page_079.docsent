   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE THREE BRINGING THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES INTO AN ORDERLY LIFE Scripture Reading: Titus 2:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:1-8 the word healthy is used three times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 1 Paul says, "But as for you, speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 Paul speaks of being healthy in faith, love, and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 8 Paul refers to "healthy speech that cannot be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching and show himself a pattern of healthy words, and the elderly men were to be healthy in faith, love, and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is significant that in these verses, a portion of Titus in which the saints are charged to live an orderly life in the church, Paul uses the word healthy three times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we study the verses where this word is used, and especially if we pray-read them, we shall be richly nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would encourage you to pray over Paul's word concerning healthy teaching, being healthy in faith, love, and endurance, and healthy speech.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do this, you will enjoy an excellent spiritual meal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. TO SPEAK THE THINGS WHICH ARE FITTING TO HEALTHY TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Titus 2:1 says, "But as for you, speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse opens with the word "but" to show that it is in contrast to 1:16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In contrast to those who profess to know God, but by their works deny Him, Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The healthy teaching is always according to the truth 1:14 of the faith 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the content of the apostles' teaching, the content of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It not only ministers the life supply to the believers and heals the spiritual diseases, but in so doing also brings the church into a sound condition with a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, it is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2:1 Paul charged Titus not to deviate from the healthy teaching, from the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He should not be like the gainsayers, the vain talkers, those who teach differently and make the church subject to the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also should be reminded to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word healthy points to that which is hygienic and which can both inoculate others against spiritual poison and also supply them with life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our teachings should not merely pass on knowledge to others, but should supply them with life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Often when I have been tempted to speak about a certain subject, I was stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I had the sense that there was not much of the hygienic element in what I planned to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to remind ourselves and be reminded by the Spirit to give forth healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Healthy teachings do not provoke debates or arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we give adequate attention to feeding on the Lord, we shall not care to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A dining table is not a place for debate or argument; it is a place for feasting and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we should not exchange the dining table for a desk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to learn how to put healthy "dishes" on the dining table to feed the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONCERNING THE AGED MEN</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in fighting the battle for the truth, we need to maintain excellent relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our behavior needs to be according to the highest standard and also very human.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In every area of our daily life and family life we must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the three Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus Paul emphasizes the importance of a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2:2 Paul speaks to the aged men and says, "Aged men are to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance."</S>
