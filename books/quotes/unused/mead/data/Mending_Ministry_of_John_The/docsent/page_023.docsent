   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTED INTO ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 17 the word one is used four times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>11, 21, 22, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last reference says not only "that they may be one" but adds two more words, "perfected into" one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Shortcomings of Other Saints</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have our defects and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we are together, even for a short period of time, these are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ways of others are annoying to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if we are one with the saints, we are not perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do we handle these annoyances?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do we feel we must put up with them in order to keep the oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We keep the oneness while we gnash our teeth!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our oneness needs to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to be transformed, so that our shortcomings and defects are left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of us need this perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am a punctual person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I travel with the brothers, however, they sometimes keep me waiting till the last minute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have a plane to catch, but they do not show up until the time is too short and we must rush to the airport.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For years the brothers have kept me waiting!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be almost time for the meeting to begin, yet I see that some are still outside talking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shall I lose my temper with you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I must stay on the cross and be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need this perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, the church life is surely wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But even while we declare how wonderful it is, we hold back our tears, acknowledging that we need to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 17:23, the last of the four references in this chapter to the oneness, adds this last aspect, " that they may be perfected into one."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perfected!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No Way Out</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There can be no divorce from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is as permanent as marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no back door and no fire escape.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church door is good only as an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once you step across the threshold, the door locks behind you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It will not unlock for you to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is any place where you may come and go as you please, that place is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Could your nose decide to stop being part of your body?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No member of the Body can leave.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you feel at liberty to withdraw, you are probably only a denture, not a genuine member!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your thumb may be in a great deal of pain, but can it say, "That is all I can stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I quit!"?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can the thumb leave the body?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the church is the Body, your only way is to be perfected; there is no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have been in the church life almost fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that every day has been happy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, there may be a honeymoon at first, but a honeymoon is of short duration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our whole marriage will not be like that; it is the "vinegar-moon" which is real!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there can be no divorce in the divine marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No Tolerance</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are only four things which the church will not tolerate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To worship idols is an insult to God; this the church cannot allow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because this damages the humanity God created for His purpose, the Bible strongly forbids it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The third is division.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because it damages the Body of Christ, the church cannot permit division.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The last is the denial of Christ's Person and redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church cannot accept any teaching which denies that Christ is the Son of God who died for our sins: nor can the church receive anyone who holds such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Tolerance</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Apart from these four things idol worship, immorality, division, and the denial of Christ's Person and redemptive work the church must be tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If someone stands up in a meeting and speaks in tongues, what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You cannot cast him out; to do so would be sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If someone insists that believers should be sprinkled, will you reject him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you insist that your way is right, or if you reject him, you are being sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oneness Only in the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are here for the proper church life, standing on the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not trying to be one in doctrine or in practices; a oneness in these areas is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our oneness is in the Triune God, not in our beliefs or ways of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As those who believe in the Lord Jesus and are the regenerated children of God, we are all members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Regardless of the differences we may have in practice or in doctrine, we have no way but to remain here in the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can give no place to idol worship, immorality, division, or the denial of Christ's divinity and redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But of other things we must be tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May the Lord preserve us in Himself that we may enjoy the real oneness.</S>
