   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, firstly we need redemption, and secondly we need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's redemption is to deal with man's fall, whereas God's salvation is to carry out God's intention, which is to give Himself as the Spirit to be life to man 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is notable that the founders of the religions of the world did not have the term redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What they taught is the need to atone for mistakes by meritorious service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you think you have merits?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if you did, what about your former sins?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the Bible tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He not only redeems us but also saves us by giving Himself as the Spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. The Redemption through Christ's Precious Blood Laying the Foundation and Paving the Way for the Salvation in God's Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The redemption through Christ's blood lays the foundation and paves the way for salvation in God's life Acts 11:18; Rom 5:17b-18, 21b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day, four thousand years after man was created, God was incarnated to become a man, and His name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time God came and entered into man to be joined with man as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, He was God, and He was also man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His becoming a man effected His union with the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You and I are included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day He went to the cross and shed His blood to die for us, to bear our sins, and to solve all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The death of Christ on the cross is a mysterious death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since He was in union with mankind, when He died as a man, we also were brought by Him to the cross to die there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a very mysterious teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible tells us that we are crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He brought us, as mankind, with Him to the cross to be put to death there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when He was crucified, we also were crucified in and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then He was resurrected, and in His resurrection He imparted God to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 5:17b shows that the grace and the gift of righteousness, which were brought to us through Christ's redemption, can be abundant to such a degree that we are able to reign in the life of God not only to overcome but even to conquer and reign over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the universe among the human race there is such a history.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was a man who was openly crucified, but three days after He was buried, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He was resurrected, we also were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In resurrection He imparted God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the Bible says that we were crucified with Him, and we were raised up together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be crucified with Him is for redemption, and to be raised up with Him is for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The salvation of God is carried out by His imparting Himself to us to be in us through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, today we are also the resurrected ones in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is in us, that is, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He wants not only to be born in us but also to live and move with us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak, He participates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever we do, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is unknown to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The unbelievers think that to believe in Jesus is to believe in a religion and reform one's outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the Bible teaches us that God is life, and that apart from Him there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only His life is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This God who is life wants to enter into man to be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He created man in order that man might be a vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, today anyone who is without God or without Christ is an empty man; he does not have reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reality of man is Christ, who is God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God Himself was incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this man, He brought the human race to the cross to die there with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then He brought the human race with Him to be resurrected, and in this resurrection He regenerated those whom He had chosen.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In resurrection He was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, God, Christ, and the Spirit are not three separately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is Christ, and Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, as the life-giving Spirit, Christ applies God's redemption and salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's salvation in life consists of four major steps: regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
