   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Rock Being Christ, the Son of the Living God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As far as His own person is concerned, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This knowledge is indispensable to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our knowledge of the Lord does not depend on what the Gospels say that He has done; our knowledge of Him depends on our knowledge of Him as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What man sees, hears, and touches are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is much more than what man sees and touches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone confesses Him as the Son of Man; both friends and foes acknowledged Him as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But only those who have received God's revelation know that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's eyes, whether or not a man has life depends on whether he knows Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible says, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" John 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name" 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eternal life is knowing Jesus Christ, the One whom God has sent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eternal life is knowing the Lord Jesus as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible tells us that the Son of God is "the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance" Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is "the image of the invisible God" Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son of God is God manifesting Himself among men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, if a man wants to know God, he must know the Son of God; he must know God through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God, the expression of God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has manifested Himself through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The nature of the Son is just God Himself, while the expression of God's substance is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"I and the Father are one" 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 , He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He unveils Himself to man and when man sees Him and touches Him, He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Word is the very Word who was with God in the beginning, and this Word was God John 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Words are expressions of a person; they represent the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a man utters some words, others realize what is inside him; they know the kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son of God is God's spoken Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through Him man can understand and know God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, is God's expression; He is God "manifested in the flesh" 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus is the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, to know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God is to know Him as the One who has God's life and nature; it is to know Him as God's expression and to know that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man does not know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, he does not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also" 1 John 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has raised the Lord Jesus from the dead and designated Him the Son of God in power Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God desires that man would know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God so that through His Son, man would come to know God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What causes us to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's revelation within us causes us to recognize the Lord Jesus as God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Father who is in the heavens has told us that the Lord Jesus is God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus performed many miracles on earth, which demonstrated that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, a man does not confess Jesus as the Son of God because of the miracles and works of wonders he sees, but because of the revelation which he receives from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many brothers and sisters believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God without seeing even one miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, many people who saw the Lord's miracles with their own eyes did not confess Him as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter did not know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God because he had followed the Lord for so many years and had insight about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No man can be so capable as to know Him this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is only one reason that a man knows the Lord Jesus is the Son of God: the Father in the heavens has revealed it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who have seen miracles can confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, but those who have not seen miracles can still confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, because the Father in the heavens grants men this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church is a group of people whose eyes have been opened by the Lord to see that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This inward knowledge can withstand any test.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They know inwardly that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and nothing can shake them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They can forget what they see outwardly, and they can forget what they hear outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But they cannot forget what they know inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is not only revealing the person of the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is also revealing His ministry to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In His person, the Lord Jesus is the Son of God; in His ministry, He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word Christ is the same as the word Messiah, which means the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>An anointed person is one who is joined to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Old Testament, when a man was appointed by God to be a priest, a prophet, or a king, he was anointed with ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, an anointed one is one who is commissioned and sent by God to accomplish His work and fulfill His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that God's eternal plan is accomplished through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In eternity past, the Lord Jesus was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But at the beginning of God's eternal plan, the Son of God became the Christ of God, for the purpose of accomplishing God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's Christ is eternal, but He was there from the eternity which has a beginning, while the Son of God was there from the eternity that does not have a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Son of God does not have a beginning, in the same way that God does not have a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But God's Christ came into being when God's eternal plan came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ was established for the fulfillment of God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The anointed One was separated for God's special work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>From that point on, God's Son became God's Worker, His Messenger, and His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>From that point on, all of God's work, all of His hopes, and all of His goals were centered on His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From that point on, God's Son is not only God's Son, He has also become God's Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God's Son became God's Christ and the anointed One for the purpose of accomplishing God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A Christian must see God's eternal plan before he can become useful in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is not enough for a Christian merely to know that he has sinned, that the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption for him, and that he can be saved through receiving the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This Christian will not perish and go into perdition, but he will be of no use in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God did not establish the church simply for the purpose of gaining a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God established the church for the purpose of gaining a group of people who would know His purpose and plan in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need revelation from the Father who is in the heavens in order to know that the Lord Jesus is the Christ of God and the anointed One, that Christ is the Head of the church, that the church is the Body of Christ, and that it shares in the anointing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, we have to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, and we have to confess that we are Christians who belong to Christ and who share in the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One day when God opens our eyes, we will realize how narrow our view has been during all the years we were Christians, and how small a realm we have covered in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One day God will place us under His anointing, and we will see the kind of work that He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is amazing that some claim that they have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and yet they have not entered into God's work or seen the purpose of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>May the Lord open our eyes to see the purpose of the Lord Jesus' anointing and the purpose of the church's anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The anointing which the church receives is the same anointing the Head received, because the church is under the anointing of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Not only do we need to know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, but we must know Him also as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Not only do we need to know that the Lord Jesus possesses God's life and nature, but we must know that He is the anointed One who accomplishes God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Through Him as the Son of God, we can know God Himself, and through Him as the Christ of God, we can know God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we only know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God without knowing Him as the Christ of God, we will not understand God's purpose in creating us and His purpose in saving us; we will not understand what God wants to gain from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must have both kinds of knowledge the knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Christ of God.</S>
