<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days</H2><P>If we look at the last prophecy in Daniel (chs. 10â€”12), we shall see that this last prophecy coincides with the former ones. For now, we cannot consider it in detail. We can only study it in brief.</P><P>"And forces from him will arise and profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and remove the daily sacrifice; and they will set up the abomination that desolates" (Dan. 11:31). How this verse matches chapter nine!</P><P>"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the water of the river, as He lifted up His right hand and His left hand to heaven and swore by Him who lives forever that there would be a time and times and half a time; and when the shattering of the power of the holy people is completed, all these things will be completed...And from the time that the daily sacrifice is removed and the abomination that desolates is set up, there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days...the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days! But you, go your way until the end, and you will rest and rise again in your lot at the end of the days" (Dan. 12:7, 11-13).</P><P>Here again we see the period of three and a half years. 1,290 days are thirty days more than three and a half years; 1,335 days are forty-five days more than 1,290 days. When the three and a half years (1,260 days) are up, the Lord Jesus will descend to the earth. The extra thirty days will probably be used to judge the Gentiles (Matt. 25:31-46) or to cleanse the holy temple. Forty-five days later, it will be the time for Israel to obtain her glory.</P><P>What we have just studied shows us a few things:</P><P>(1) The time of the Gentiles, which is the time for the Gentiles to be kings, will suddenly terminate. There will be One like the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of heaven to establish a kingdom.</P><P>(2) The last Gentile power will be the Roman Empire, the king of which will blaspheme God and His saints and will eventually be punished.</P><P>(3) Antichrist will make a covenant with the Jews. The Jews in their unbelief will recover the holy temple and its sacrifices until the last three and a half years when Antichrist will break his covenant to cause the sacrifices to cease and will bring in the worship of idols. Then there will be great destruction until the predetermined three and a half years are up. Then God will deliver His chosen people, and the time of the Gentiles will be fulfilled with the sudden coming of the Lord from heaven. When we speak of the above Scriptural truths, there is no painstaking straining because we simply confirm the Scriptural verses one by another. We have seen how the period of three and a half years in which the little horn prospers (ch. 7) corresponds with the last three and a half years of the seventieth week (ch. 9) and how it also corresponds with the three and a half years in chapter twelve. All the different prophecies in the Scripture match one another. The only difference between them is that sometimes the latter explains the former and sometimes adds something to the former.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPHECIES OF THE LORD JESUS</H2><P>From the Old Testament prophecies, we see how the thought of the Holy Spirit is expressed consistently throughout. Now we can see how the prophecies in the New Testament correspond to those in the Old Testament. After that we will look again at Revelation, which we are now expounding, to see how it also corresponds with the previous prophecies. We can first look at the prophecies of our Lord Jesus on the Mount of Olives. For our present purposes we do not need to mention all the prophecies on the Mount. We only need to mention those prophecies on the Mount which concern the Jews. The prophecies on the Mount are recorded in the first three Gospels, but for now we will take Matthew 24 as the main one and will only make reference to the records in the other Gospels. All the prophecies in Matthew 24:4-31 concern the Jews. If we compare this section of the Word with what we have read in Daniel, we will be very clear.</P><P>The disciples asked the Lord Jesus two questions, one concerning the temple, the other concerning the Lord's coming back and the signs at the consummation of the age (v. 3). The Lord's answer to the first question concerning the temple, which naturally does not concern us, is recorded more in detail in Luke 21. However, Matthew pays more attention to the answer to the second question. In this question the disciples confused the Lord's coming back with the consummation of the age. Actually these two matters are separate. We do not need to speak of this here. It is enough for us to know for now that the passage up to verse 31 speaks of the Jews.</P><P>We know that between the sixty-ninth and the seventieth weeks, there is a period of grace. When the seventieth week comes the oblation and sacrifice in the temple will be restored until they will be suppressed again by Antichrist. What our Lord talked about is this period of time. He said, "When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment" (Matt. 24:15-18). Because the enemy is in their midst, their flight is urgent.</P><P>Furthermore, the godly saints will be the object of the wrath of Antichrist; this destroying army will come quickly, hence they should rather forsake some things to keep their lives. "But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days" (v. 19) because these ones will not be able to run. "And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath" (v. 20). This word is clearly for the Jews. The Lord Jesus continued: "For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" (v. 21). This statement is also a quotation from Daniel: "And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered" (Dan. 12:1). That day will be a time of great distress. However, it will also be the day of God's salvation. Hence, the Lord said, "And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short" (Matt. 24:22). We can see from Daniel that the time of those days will be three and a half years. Later the Lord spoke of the signs of false Christs and false prophets. This part was not spoken of in the Old Testament. "At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen. Behold, I have told you beforehand. Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms; do not believe it. For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures be gathered together" (vv. 23-28).</P><P>Daniel's testimony was that all the sufferings will cease once the Lord Jesus comes again. Matthew also said the same thing: "And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end" (vv. 29-31). This is good enough. We can see how the prophecies of the New Testament correspond to those of the Old Testament.</P>
