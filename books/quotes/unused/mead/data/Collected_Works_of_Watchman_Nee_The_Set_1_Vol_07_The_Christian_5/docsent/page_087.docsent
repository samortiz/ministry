   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYER AND DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer is an expression of our desire before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible records that many people had their prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every one of them prayed with a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without a desire, there is no need for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If what we pray for truly comes from the bottom of our heart, surely the answers to our prayers will not be so few.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is because our desire is not single that our prayers become sounding brass and clanging cymbals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The greatest danger to prayer is our attempt to be ornate and to pray according to formal rules.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is more danger in public prayer than in private prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, nine times out of ten the long prayers of a "thousand words" are empty prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid such prayers are directed more toward men than toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times, the content of a prayer is very pleasant, the voice very desperate, and the tone very harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet everything is directed toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God will not hear nor answer such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayers that are without any desire are a mockery to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's eyes these prayers are detestable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when a person prays alone, is it not true that many terms he uses are familiar terms that are uttered without much thought?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the words have become so familiar, the same words may be uttered without any response from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such prayers are really a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are worse than useless!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who truly understand God and His holiness and majesty will never do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we come to God with a pure heart and realize who He is with whom we have come face to face, would we ever dare to be hypocritical?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, we should never pray beyond what the Holy Spirit has prompted us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do this, surely it is counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, it is best to allow the Holy Spirit to place in our spirit the things that we should pray for, so that we will not offend God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should learn to be honest before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is better to have short prayers than false prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pay all the more attention to this matter when we pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many supplications are but a kind of payment of debts!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, there is no sense of desire, and the whole thing is a mere routine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, those who do not have a real love for others cannot pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we feel others' need to be like our own, we will pray sincerely for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we feel others' need in the same way they feel it themselves, we will make supplications for them faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is because there is no love for others that prayers have become mere empty voices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should sympathize with others more and should identify ourselves with others more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May we henceforth pray with our mouth and also with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May our prayers reach the presence of God like fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>HOLINESS AND HARDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians are the most unaffected people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet at the same time, they are the most compassionate people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They know only the heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Other than the Lord Jesus, they have no other loves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why they are the most unaffected people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, they are not selective in their love of men; they love all the brothers, the lovable ones as well as the unlovable ones, and they love even their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why they are the most compassionate people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Holiness is the believers' goal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet if a person is not careful, his holiness will become others' stumbling block.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our experience, many times our holiness becomes a hardness!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The holy believers many times are the difficult ones!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The holier they are, the more people in their eyes need to be condemned, and the more merciless will the judgments and criticisms be that follow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The holiness of those who do not fully understand God's grace gives the impression that they are without affection and are simple-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such people will not help others but will only invite criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They think that they are uplifting God's standard and bearing a good testimony for God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, they have forgotten that God's holiness belongs to God, while they are human.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to recognize this fact and should not indiscriminately take God's holiness as our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God in His holiness is imposing and unapproachable, but we are human.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although we are saved and regenerated, we are still human.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should assimilate God's holiness and make it our human holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what the Lord Jesus did in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was holiness incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, in His spirit He was separated from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Peter saw Him, he had to declare, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" Luke 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, He is the friend of sinners, publicans, and prostitutes, the men and women despised by the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ sympathized with them, cared for them, had pity on them, and comforted them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the first case, He demonstrated His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the last case, He also demonstrated His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was not at all unapproachable, nor was He hard in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is good for believers to be holy, but they must not be hard and unapproachable to the extent that others cannot love or admire them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, to be hard is not the same as to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The two are absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is right to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet this is with respect to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Toward ourselves, we should not be afraid of being hard.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To give up self-pitying is a signpost to the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet toward others we should have love and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God is holy, but this holiness is coupled with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can be holy, but we must not be negligent to the point that we become cold and indifferent like rocks and wood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God has not saved us to become non-human.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the contrary, it was because we had fallen into a non-human condition that He came to save us and make us human.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, although we may appear to be the most unaffected people, we should at the same time be the most compassionate people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A truly holy life is never lacking in meekness, peace, goodness, and all the other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should treat others in the same way that a shepherd cares patiently for his flock.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A poured-out life is often a fruit-bearing life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hardness drives men away, whereas kindness melts men's heart to join us in the heavenly path.</S>
