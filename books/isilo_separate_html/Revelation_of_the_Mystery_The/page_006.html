Let me ask you, &#8220;Is Christ you?&#8221; You must say, &#8220;Yes, Christ is me because Christ is all, and I am included in all!&#8221; I am not something negative. As a human being, I am something positive, so Christ is surely the real me. Thank and praise the Lord that Christ is the real us! In Him we see God, and in Him we also see ourselves! Do you have the boldness to say that Christ is the real you? The last two lines of stanza 4 of Hymn #130 in the Chinese hymnal say, &#8220;Thou became me, and I became Thee: / &#8217;Tis Thy love to the uttermost!&#8221; Since the first part of that line says, &#8220;Thou became me,&#8221; it naturally follows that the second part should say, &#8220;I became Thee.&#8221; Some have opposed this, saying, &#8220;To say that Christ became us may be all right because Christ became flesh. However, if we say that we have become Christ, that means that we have become God. Is this not blasphemy?&#8221; I do not know what kind of mind those opposing people have. Would it not be ridiculous for someone to say that four plus four equals eight but that eight does not equal four plus four? The Bible says that we are members of the Body of Christ. Suppose I said, &#8220;This arm is a member of this brother, but it is not this brother himself. Therefore, when I hit this member, I am not hitting this brother himself.&#8221; This kind of logic does not make any sense. We have all become members of Christ, so how can we not be Christ? Not only so, 1 Corinthians 12 says explicitly that the Body is Christ: &#8220;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ&#8221; (v. 12). The Christ here is the Body. Therefore, to say &#8220;Thou became me, and I became Thee&#8221; is not heresy. Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that He is the vine and that we are the branches (John 15:5). The branches are included in the vine. We may even say that the branches are the vine.<p>This is the wonder of wonders and the mystery of mysteries-that Christ is all. If we all would know Christ to such an extent, how noble we would be! Christ is me, and I am Christ! He is Christ in me. Is God in the Bible? Then who is God? God is Christ. Is Jehovah in the Scriptures? Then who is Jehovah? Jehovah is Christ. Is the Father in the Bible? Then who is the Father? The Father is Christ (Isa. 9:6). Is the Son in the Scriptures? Then who is the Son? The Son is Christ! Is the Spirit in the Bible? Then who is the Spirit? The Spirit is Christ (1 Cor. 15:45b). Is man in the Scriptures? Then who is the real man? The real man is Christ. Are you in the Bible? Then who is the real you? The real you is Christ! Hallelujah! Christ is all. Christ is not only all in the new man but also all in the whole universe.<p>We must see that Christ is our life, our virtues, and our all in all. Where is He? He is in our spirit. What is He in our spirit? He is the Spirit in our spirit. This Christ who has become our all is in our spirit as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. Today, we live by Christ when we live by the Spirit. When we live by Him, we allow Him to live Himself through us. When He lives Himself out of us, then it is possible for us to live Christ.<p>If we seek the Lord, sooner or later He will open our eyes to see that as the Christ of all, He is all. He is not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, He is also the reality of all positive things. Hallelujah! We must see the all-inclusive Christ. The greatest mystery in the universe is that He can become us and we can become Him. As the all-inclusive Spirit He enters into our regenerated spirit to be joined and mingled with us. The two spirits-His Spirit and our spirit-became one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). He lives instead of us, and we live by Him (Gal. 2:20). Therefore, what we live out is Christ. For to us, to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21).<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
