   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE LIVING BY THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4a, 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the past messages, we see that most Christian teachings have altogether missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The lost ones, of course, have missed the mark, but even those who are saved have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man realizes that in his own life there is a lack, but he does not understand what the real shortage is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christians know that they have been saved, but most of them do not have a clear vision that God s intention is to work Himself into them as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regardless of whether we are saved or not, God s intention is still the same, that is, to work Himself into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SHORTAGE IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All human beings are short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our daily life we are short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As husbands, we are short.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As wives, we are short.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we are short.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But so many do not realize that they are short.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even those that realize that they are short of God do not know that they are short of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today on the earth there are many different things that appear good, yet they are so distracting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First there is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then there is human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Besides this, there are the ethical teachings of many great philosophers and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many things are good, yet they are very misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may think that they are short of ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others may think that they are short of good character.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But none of these things are our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps some sisters think they are short of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In their home life with their husband and children, they always sense that they need more patience, and they always appreciate those who have more patience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they really don t know what they are short of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The very ones they appreciate as having patience are also short.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who don t have patience are short, and those who do have patience are also short.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are all short of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is it that we are all short of?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some will immediately answer, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is right, but what do you mean by saying that we are short of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am afraid that we have the same kind of saying, but a different dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We say the same word, but our understanding differs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have been doing this work for many years, and I still do not have the proper terminology or vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some words are right, but they have been spoiled by Christianity, which has entirely missed the proper meaning of the proper words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past messages we have seen something of God s intention from the Gospels of Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But I am still not confident that you have seen the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone would say that our shortage is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are thousands of different definitions of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very difficult to define Him, and yet it is also very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most difficult things on earth are the most simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am breathing now, but perhaps in thirty minutes my breathing will stop, and that would mean death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What then is death?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is hard to define.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is also hard to define life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the most simple things, yet they are the most difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the same with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is simple to understand Him, yet He is the hardest Person in the world to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All human history, including all of Christianity and all other kinds of religion have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And the mark is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God wants to work Himself into man, and He has never changed His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In creation, God s intention was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In redemption, God s intention was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In salvation, God s intention is still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For eternity, God s intention will be eternally the same.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has never changed His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is to work Himself into you and me as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether we are saved or lost, this does not change God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are lost, we need God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are saved, we still need God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we hate others, we need it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we love others, we need it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether we are old or young, we need it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether we are strong or weak, we need it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of what we are, who we are, or where we are, we need God to work Himself into us.</S>
