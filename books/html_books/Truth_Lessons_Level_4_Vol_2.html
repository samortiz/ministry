<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks mainly concerning God&rsquo;s economy. In His economy God has two elect peoples: Israel in the Old Testament and the believers in the New Testament. For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God desires to gain these two elect peoples. He first chose Israel to be His beloved elect, and around Israel are the Gentile nations. Israel and the Gentiles, the nations, are both related to God, because they were both created by God. God determined the borders of the nations and placed the children of Israel in the midst of the Gentiles (Deut. 32:8) so that He could spread His gospel from among the Israelites to gain those among the Gentiles whom He chose to be His people. Furthermore, in the coming kingdom the restored nations will be led by the saved Israelites to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3).</p>
<p>God also has an enemy, Satan, who causes much damage. Satan came into man&rsquo;s flesh by tempting him to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He has also used some of the nations&mdash;created but not chosen by God&mdash;to frustrate God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Satan will continue to oppose God until the end of the age of grace, that is, the conclusion of the great tribulation, when he will stir up Antichrist and his followers to fight with Christ and His faithful followers (Rev. 17:14; 19:11-21; 16:12-16). When Antichrist is defeated, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then Christ will establish the millennial kingdom on the earth to restore all things (11:15; 20:4-6; Acts 3:21; Matt. 19:28). After one thousand years Satan will be released from the abyss to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth. The deceived nations will surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire will come down out of heaven and will devour them. The devil, who deceived them, will be cast into the lake of fire, thus eternally clearing up the rebellion of Satan (Rev. 20:8-10). Then the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 21:1), into which the New Jerusalem will come (v. 2) to be the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s economy unto eternity.</p>
<p>In the previous volume we saw the prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ, the church, and the believers. In this volume we will consider the prophecies concerning Israel (God&rsquo;s elect), the Gentile nations, Satan, Antichrist and his followers, the last week, the great tribulation, the millennium, the new heaven and new earth, and the New Jerusalem. We will begin by looking at Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy and Noah&rsquo;s prophecies concerning his three sons&mdash;Shem, Ham, and Japheth&mdash;in Genesis. Enoch prophesied that God would judge that ungodly generation. Noah&rsquo;s prophecies are the earliest in the Bible concerning mankind and the nations. His prophecies have also had a far-reaching effect on God&rsquo;s elect, Israel and the church, and on the development of the world situation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ENOCH&rsquo;S PROPHECY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Enoch Prophesying concerning God<br />
Using the Flood to Judge<br />
the Ungodly Generation of That Time</h2>
<p>Enoch was the first person to prophesy in the Bible. Genesis 5:21 says, &ldquo;Enoch lived sixty-five years and begot Methuselah.&rdquo; <em>Methuselah</em> means &ldquo;when he is dead, it will be sent.&rdquo; This name is an important prophecy concerning the coming of God&rsquo;s judging flood on that ungodly generation at the time of Methuselah&rsquo;s death. By naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied of the coming of the flood to destroy the living things on the earth.</p>
<p>Methuselah begot Lamech when he was one hundred eighty-seven years old (v. 25), and Lamech begot Noah when he was one hundred eighty-two years old (vv. 28-29). The flood came when Noah was six hundred years old (7:11). Thus, the flood came when Methuselah was nine hundred sixty-nine years old, that is, the year that he died. Therefore, by naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied concerning the flood that came in the year that Methuselah died.</p>
<p>After knowing God&rsquo;s will, Enoch prophesied concerning the flood when he was sixty-five years old. This must have caused him to anticipate the fulfillment of the prophecy and thus walk with God daily. Even though that generation and everything in it was ungodly, Enoch separated himself to walk with God. Finally, he was delivered from God&rsquo;s judgment and was taken by God to be an overcomer in that age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Enoch Prophesying Concerning<br />
the Manifestation of Christ in His Return</h2>
<p>Like many other prophecies in the Old Testament, Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy has a double fulfillment. The coming of the flood was the first fulfillment. Jude 14-15 is the second fulfillment of Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s coming in this verse must refer to the manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (coming) as spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 2:8; Matthew 24:27, 30; and Zechariah 14:4-5. The saints referred to in Jude 14 probably include, as in Zechariah 14:5, the saints (1 Thes. 3:13) and the angels (Matt. 16:27; 25:31; Mark 8:38). Enoch prophesied that when the Lord Jesus returns, He will come with myriads of His saints. The &ldquo;saints&rdquo; in Jude 14 are in contrast to the &ldquo;ungodly&rdquo; in verse 15, who will be convicted. Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy must have influenced his living and caused him to live a godly and holy life by faith in midst of an ungodly generation. Enoch walked with God for three hundred years (Gen. 5:22).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. NOAH&rsquo;S PROPHECIES CONCERNING<br />
SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. After the Flood Noah Being the Leader<br />
on the New Land and the Father of All Mankind and Also Being God&rsquo;s Deputy Authority</h2>
<p>According to the record of Genesis, after the flood Noah became the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind on the earth. When Noah and his family came out of the ark to start a new living, the first thing they did was to build an altar and offer sacrifices to God (8:20-22). Noah&rsquo;s offering satisfied God, so &ldquo;God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. And the fear of you and the terror of you shall be upon every animal of the earth and upon every bird of heaven, on everything that creeps on the ground and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered...Be fruitful and multiply; / Abound on the earth and multiply in it&rdquo; (9:1-2, 7). Noah and his family were brought back to God&rsquo;s original purpose, which is to express God and represent God. Noah became the father and the leader of all mankind, and all living things were given into his hands. God also made Noah His deputy authority on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Noah Failing because<br />
of Looseness and Carelessness</h2>
<p>As the father and leader of all mankind, undoubtedly Noah was under God&rsquo;s blessing. Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard (v. 20). He was successful in this because the vineyards produced grapes from which wine was made. At this time, he should have exercised self-control, but on the contrary, he was loose and became drunk. He was not only loose, but he was careless, becoming naked in his tent without realizing it (v. 21). This was his failure. Because Noah was not covered properly before God, his nakedness was seen by his son Ham. After seeing the nakedness of his father, Ham, the father of Canaan, told his two brothers outside. Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon their shoulders, and they walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward so that they did not see their father&rsquo;s nakedness (vv. 22-23).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Noah Still Taking Care of God&rsquo;s Government</h2>
<p>Noah was a godly man. He was also the father of a family and the leader of mankind. But he made a mistake and had a failure, and his mistake was exposed. When Noah woke up, he cursed the one who exposed his nakedness and blessed the ones who covered him (vv. 24-27). We may think that Noah should have confessed and admitted his failure. However, since God had established him as the leader, Noah had to speak, not according to his feeling of conviction but according to God&rsquo;s government. Even though he failed, he did not disregard his leadership, his position as God&rsquo;s deputy authority. Instead, he took care of God&rsquo;s government and God&rsquo;s economy on the earth and represented God to speak a strong governmental word. Ham despised God&rsquo;s government by seeing and exposing Noah&rsquo;s failure. Thus, he lost the blessing and brought in a curse. Because Shem and Japheth respected God&rsquo;s government, they did not see their father&rsquo;s nakedness. Rather, they covered their father&rsquo;s failure. Because of this, they were kept under God&rsquo;s government. They thus escaped the damage caused by Satan and received the blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. After Failing, Noah Prophesying<br />
according to God&rsquo;s Government</h2>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s curse and blessing were prophecies inspired by God in His governmental dealing. They were not according to Noah&rsquo;s personal feeling. They were according to God&rsquo;s government. They were not of Noah but of the very God who exercises His government over mankind. Noah prophesied according to God&rsquo;s government to curse one of his sons and to bless the other two.</p>
<p>According to history, Noah&rsquo;s three sons eventually became three great races. Japheth became the forefather of the Europeans, and according to Noah&rsquo;s prophecy, Japheth would be enlarged by God. This means that the descendants of Japheth would be the strong ones to conquer and spread. Over five hundred years ago, Columbus ventured to sail across the Atlantic, and he reached a new continent, America. Thus, Japheth was further enlarged. Shem is the source of the races that are mostly in Asia, including the Jews. Ham became the father of the race that is mostly in Africa. Europe, Asia, and Africa come together geographically around the Mediterranean Sea. The Jewish land of Palestine is in the center of these three inhabited sections: Europe to the north, Africa to the south, and Asia to the east. Hence, Noah&rsquo;s prophecies concern the history of the whole world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Noah&rsquo;s Prophecy concerning Ham</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Canaan, a Descendant of Ham, Being Cursed<br />
to Be a Servant to Shem and Japheth</h2>
<p>Through Noah&rsquo;s prophecy, God cursed the son who exposed his father&rsquo;s failure. Canaan, Ham&rsquo;s son, received a curse to be a servant to both Shem and Japheth (v. 25). Ham was the father of Cush (10:6), who is the forefather of the Ethiopians.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Ham&rsquo;s Descendants Producing the Nations<br />
That Opposed God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>Cush begot Nimrod (v. 8), who built Assyria with Nineveh as the capital. He also built Babylon with Babel as the capital (vv. 10-11; Micah 5:6). Assyria and Babylon became the leading nations that opposed God&rsquo;s people. The first nation to invade Israel was Assyria. Then Babylon followed Assyria to conquer Israel, destroy Jerusalem, burn down the temple, and exile the great majority of the children of Israel (2 Kings 25:1-21; 2 Chron. 36:17-20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Noah&rsquo;s Prophecy concerning Shem</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Being the God of Shem</h2>
<p>Noah prophesied, saying, &ldquo;Blessed be Jehovah, / The God of Shem&rdquo; (Gen. 9:26). Jehovah, the very God, is of Shem. The Jews are the descendants of Shem. They have to boast, saying, &ldquo;God is ours.&rdquo; Even the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22). Shem was blessed by gaining God. God became Shem&rsquo;s blessing, and He is also man&rsquo;s rest, peace, enjoyment, and salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Whatever Being Related to God Coming out of the Jews</h2>
<p>Whatever is related to God has come out of the Jews. The Old Testament was written by the Jews. Except for one Gentile, Luke, the New Testament was also written by Jews. Even Luke wrote with the knowledge that he received from the Jews. All the things concerning God, concerning God&rsquo;s gospel, concerning Christ, and concerning salvation have come out of the Jews. Shem does not have government or the sciences like Japheth. Shem has God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Tents of Shem</h2>
<p>Ham&rsquo;s descendant Nimrod built Babel, but Shem&rsquo;s descendant Abraham built and lived in tents. The children of Israel also built the tabernacle for God. The Lord Jesus, one of Shem&rsquo;s descendants, was likened to a tent, a tabernacle (John 1:14). Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s eternal tent, His eternal tabernacle (Rev. 21:2-3). The names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on its gates (v. 12), and the names of the twelve Jewish apostles are on the foundations of its wall (v. 14).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Noah&rsquo;s Prophecy concerning Japheth</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Japheth Being Enlarged</h2>
<p>God gave Japheth the blessing of being enlarged (Gen. 9:27). Most of the people of Europe, Russia, and America are Japheth&rsquo;s descendants. Especially since the time of Columbus, the Europeans have been constantly expanding, reaching the whole world. This expansion is carried out mainly by governmental power, science, and art, including skills and trades. The Americans are the expansion of the Europeans. Eventually, the European culture spread throughout the world through America. This is a fulfillment of the blessing spoken prophetically to Japheth.</p>
<p>According to Noah&rsquo;s prophecy, the descendants of Japheth are a strong people. If we read history carefully, we can see that God always carries out His economy through strong people.</p>
<p>For example, the Roman Empire was a strong nation. They built highways and opened up traffic from Palestine to Rome and even to Spain. At that time, people considered Spain to be the uttermost part of the earth. Greek was also made the common language throughout the Roman Empire. Even the Lord Jesus quoted from the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Rome conquered and captured Palestine, but on the other hand, Rome prepared a good environment for the Lord Jesus to be born. Rome also provided the way for the Lord to be crucified. Crucifixion was not a method of execution used by the Jews but by the Gentiles (Ezra 6:11). Eventually, this method was adopted by the Roman Empire to execute heinous criminals. Christ&rsquo;s method of death, His being cut off, was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.</p>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the apostles rose up to spread the gospel. Their spreading of the gospel was facilitated by Roman highways on the land and by Roman ships on the seas. Thus, the preaching of the gospel in the initial stage was through the strong nation of Rome. On the one hand, the strong nation of Rome persecuted and even crucified Christ, and it also persecuted and martyred the apostles. On the other hand, through this strong empire the way was prepared for Christ to be born and crucified and for the gospel to be preached.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, God used Great Britain as the world power, through the practice of imperialism, to pave the way to keep order in the whole world for the sake of mission work. The Lord used England spiritually at that time for the spread of His gospel throughout the world. Imperialism is the policy and practice of maintaining an empire through the conquest and domination of weaker countries. Politically speaking, imperialism is evil and should be condemned, but God is sovereign. Imperialism was used by the divine hand to spread the gospel. Otherwise, many backward countries would not have been opened up. Through imperialism, weak, backward countries were compelled to open up. This gave a way for the missionaries to go into these countries with the gospel. Christ&rsquo;s birth, Christ&rsquo;s death, the spreading of the gospel in the early days of the church, and the mission work to spread the gospel to every corner of the earth were all through a strong people, the descendants of Japheth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Dwelling in the Tents of Shem</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, regardless of how much Japheth has been enlarged, he still needs to dwell in the tents of Shem. The Europeans, including the Americans, are strong, but they need the tents of Shem. For Japheth to worship God, he must believe in the God of Shem and receive rest, peace, enjoyment, and salvation in the tents of Shem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. God&rsquo;s Salvation in Christ<br />
Changing Man&rsquo;s Natural Status</h2>
<p>Japheth has been enlarged and needs to dwell in the tents of Shem. Ham has been cursed because he was involved in God&rsquo;s government. He lost the blessing. Under the curse, he became a servant of servants (Gen. 9:25). This has been proved by history. Acts 13:1 says, &ldquo;There were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.&rdquo; This verse shows that different peoples had become one as the church. Certain prophets and teachers are listed among the prominent, functioning members of the church. Barnabas and Saul were Jews. Simeon was called Niger (which means &ldquo;black&rdquo;); from this designation, he might have been a black person. Lucius of Cyrene was from Africa. Cyrene was a city in northern Africa, where Libya is today. Manaen was brought up with Herod. Herod, though a descendant of an Idumaean (an Edomite) was governmentally related to the Romans (the Europeans). So, although Manaen&rsquo;s origin is unknown, he, as a foster brother of Herod, must have been Europeanized. Thus, the five prominent functioning members of the church in Antioch were composed of two Jews, descendants of Shem; one from Africa and one who might have been a black person, both of whom might have been descendants of Ham; and one who was at least culturally related to the descendants of Japheth. They all became one as the church. Regardless of whose descendant you are, do not feel disappointed. Since we have been regenerated, we are all the church. We were born of different origins, but now we are all the church. We all were born in the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s prophecy concerning mankind spoken through Noah. But our natural status has been changed by the salvation of God in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Enoch was the first person to prophesy in the Bible. When he was sixty-five years old, he bore a son and named him Methuselah, which means &ldquo;when he is dead, it will be sent.&rdquo; This name was an important prophecy concerning the coming of God&rsquo;s judging flood on the ungodly generation at the time of Methuselah&rsquo;s death. Enoch&rsquo;s prophecy has a double fulfillment. The coming of the flood was the first fulfillment, and the second fulfillment will be at the manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (coming). Enoch prophesied that when the Lord Jesus returns, He will come with myriads of saints.</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s prophecies are the earliest prophecies in the Bible concerning mankind and the nations. His prophecies have also had a far-reaching effect on God&rsquo;s elect, Israel and the church, and on the development of the world situation. After the flood Noah became the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind. God gave all living things into Noah&rsquo;s hands and made Noah His deputy authority on the earth. However, due to his looseness and carelessness, Noah failed. He got drunk and became naked in his tent. His son Ham saw and exposed Noah&rsquo;s failure, thus despising God&rsquo;s government. But because Shem and Japheth respected God&rsquo;s government, they did not see their father&rsquo;s nakedness; rather, they covered their father&rsquo;s failure. When Noah woke up, he cursed the son who exposed his nakedness and blessed the sons who covered him. He cursed Ham&rsquo;s descendant, Canaan, to be a servant to Shem and Japheth. He prophesied that Jehovah would be the God of Shem and that Japheth would be enlarged and would dwell in the tents of Shem.</p>
<p>Even though these prophecies have been proved by history, in Acts 13 the five prominent functioning members of the church in Antioch were composed of two Jews&mdash;the descendants of Shem, two who were probably descendants of Ham, and another one who was at least culturally related to the descendants of Japheth. They all became one as the church. Therefore, regardless of whose descendant we are, all the regenerated believers are the church. Even though we have different origins, in relation to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s prophecy concerning mankind, our natural status has been changed by God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ.</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. PROPHECIES WITH PROMISES</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, in the Old Testament God&rsquo;s people had two beginnings. The first beginning was with Abraham because God&rsquo;s selection and calling began with Abraham. The other beginning was with the nation of Israel. God told the Israelites that they would be a personal treasure to Him among all the nations. They would be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exo. 19:5-6). Hence, Abraham was a definite beginning for God&rsquo;s people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God&rsquo;s people. In between these two beginnings God gained three persons&mdash;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. First there was Abraham, then there was Isaac, then Jacob, and then the nation of Israel. From that point on, the nation of Israel became the people of God. Hence, we can say that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the foundation of the nation of Israel. Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and there would not be a people of God in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament not all the Israelites, who are the seed of Abraham in the flesh, are the children of God (Rom. 9:7-8), but those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7) and hence children of God. The New Testament believers, both Jews and Gentiles, who become sons of Abraham through faith in Christ &ldquo;are blessed with believing Abraham&rdquo; (v. 9).</p>
<p>Hence, the prophecies with promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob concern not only the blessing gained by God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament but also the blessing that can be enjoyed by God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament. These prophecies with their promises are concerned even with the situation in the coming age and in eternity. Therefore, we must have a proper understanding of these prophecies and the promises hidden within them.</p>

<p>In Genesis 12:2 God said to Abraham, &ldquo;I will make of you a great nation.&rdquo; God promised Abraham that He would make of him &ldquo;a great nation.&rdquo; This great nation is the kingdom of God, which is composed of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity. In the millennial kingdom there will be two parts&mdash;the heavenly part and the earthly part. The heavenly part will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, in which the overcomers of the past and present ages will be co-kings of Christ. The earthly part is the Messianic kingdom composed of the restored kingdom of Israel. In this way, Abraham&rsquo;s name will be made great. Other than the name of the Lord Jesus, no name on earth will be greater than that of Abraham. He is the father of &ldquo;a great nation.&rdquo; He is the father of the nation of Israel and of the church, and he will be the father of the millennial kingdom and of all the redeemed ones in eternity. According to God&rsquo;s promise, what a &ldquo;great nation&rdquo; and what a great name this is!</p><h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Blessing</h2>
<p>God promised to bless Abraham (v. 2). This blessing consists of the blessings of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption, including all that God wants to give man&mdash;God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come. According to Galatians 3:14 this blessing is the promise of the Spirit: &ldquo;That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; Since the Spirit is God Himself, this means that God promised that He would give Himself to Abraham as the blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Made a Blessing<br />
to All the Families of the Earth</h2>
<p>God not only promised that He would be a blessing to Abraham but that Abraham would be a blessing to all the families, all the nations, of the earth (Gen. 12:3). In His calling, God turned from Adam to Abraham. This means that He gave up the adamic race. However, in His promise God made another turn from Abraham to all the families of the adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:14). Hence, the adamic race can be gained by God again. God not only gave Himself to Abraham as a blessing, but He also made Abraham a blessing to all the pitiful people of the adamic race. In this way, all the called ones from among the Gentiles have been brought back to God and have gained God as their blessing.</p>
<p>According to Galatians 3, God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:2-3 was His preaching the gospel to Abraham. The three items of God&rsquo;s promise were to make Abraham a great nation, to bless him, and to make him a blessing to all the families of the earth. The contents of God&rsquo;s promise are exactly the same as the contents of the gospel. First, the preaching of the gospel opens with the words, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). The kingdom of the heavens refers to the great nation promised by God to Abraham. Second, after a person repents for the kingdom, he needs to believe so that he may have eternal life, which is in the Spirit. The blessing promised to Abraham in Galatians 3:14 is the promise of the Spirit. The third item of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham is this blessing. God said, &ldquo;In you all the families of the earth will be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 12:3).</p>
<p>God promised to make Abraham a great nation and to bless him. The nation is a matter of dominion to represent God, and the blessing is a matter of image in the Spirit to express God. Hence, in God&rsquo;s promise we see His eternal purpose. God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham implies His eternal purpose, which is for man to express and represent Him (1:26-27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Bringing Forth Isaac</h2>
<p>Genesis 17:15-21 contains a definite promise concerning Isaac&rsquo;s birth. It is definite because the name Isaac was mentioned by God, and his mother was designated. Up until this point God had promised that He would give Abraham a seed and that Abraham would bring forth the seed, but God had not mentioned that the seed would be out of Sarah. Neither had He said that the seed would be named Isaac. In these verses, however, God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Gaining the Land That God Promised</h2>
<p>God promised to give Abraham the land (15:18-21; 12:7; 13:14-15, 17; 17:8). Abraham needed a place to live in and to live on. Hence, the land was a place for God&rsquo;s people to live in and to live on. The land was also a place in which Abraham could defeat all his enemies so that God could have a kingdom on earth. Moreover, the land was the place where God could have a habitation for His expression. Thus, there are five points concerning the land: it was a place for God&rsquo;s people to live, a place to provide for their living, a place where God&rsquo;s enemies could be defeated, a place where God could have His kingdom, and a place where God could have a habitation for His expression. Eventually, the kingdom of God was established, the temple was built for God&rsquo;s habitation, and the glory of God was manifested in the land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. His Seed Being Multiplied<br />
like the Stars of the Heavens and<br />
like the Sand on the Seashore</h2>
<p>In Genesis 22:17 God blessed Abraham with the multiplied seed, saying, &ldquo;I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore.&rdquo; God blessed Abraham with two categories of people, one likened to the stars of the heavens (15:5) and the other to the sand on the seashore, which is also likened to the dust of the earth (13:16). According to this prophecy, Abraham&rsquo;s descendants are of two categories, one heavenly and the other earthly. We, the Christians, are the stars, the heavenly descendants of Abraham, and the genuine Jews, God&rsquo;s earthly people, are the sand, the dust. The sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan, and the dust is of the earth created by God. Although the Jews are an earthly people, they are not the dust under the sea, but the dust, the sand, on the seashore. They are separated from the corrupted sea, Satan&rsquo;s corrupted world. However, the stars are not only separated from the corrupted world but are also heavenly.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s promise to multiply Abraham&rsquo;s descendants is sown as a seed in Genesis 22. This seed, having passed through the development of the whole Bible, will eventually be harvested at the end of Revelation. The New Jerusalem is composed of the twelve tribes of Israel, representing the Old Testament saints, and of the twelve apostles, representing the New Testament believers. The people represented by the apostles are the heavenly stars, and those represented by the twelve tribes are the sand on the seashore. These two peoples will eventually be built together into the New Jerusalem. Hence, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of Abraham&rsquo;s seed.</p><h2 class="head2">G. His Seed Suffering Affliction,<br />
Being Afflicted for Four Hundred Years, and<br />
Then Returning to the Land of Canaan</h2>
<p>In Genesis 15:12-16 God prophesied that Abraham&rsquo;s promised seed would suffer affliction. This affliction is signified by the great darkness that fell upon Abraham. As the sun was going down, Abraham fell into a deep sleep, and a terror and great darkness fell upon him. In that darkness God prophesied concerning Abraham&rsquo;s seed, saying, &ldquo;Know assuredly that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and they will serve them; and they will afflict them four hundred years. But...in the fourth generation they will come here again&rdquo; (vv. 13-14, 16).</p>
<p>History proves that Abraham&rsquo;s seed did suffer affliction for a period of four hundred years beginning with Ishmael&rsquo;s persecution of Isaac in about 1891 B.C. (21:9; Gal. 4:29) until the exodus out of Egypt in about 1491 B.C. (Exo. 3:7-8; Acts 7:6). Ishmael&rsquo;s mocking of Isaac was the beginning of the affliction of Abraham&rsquo;s seed that was to continue for four hundred years. The number four hundred is composed of ten times forty. In the Bible the number forty signifies trials, sufferings, and tests. Thus, the number four hundred indicates ten times of trials. Before the children of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years, they already had been tested for four hundred years. From Ishmael&rsquo;s persecution of Isaac, the promised seed, until the exodus out of Egypt was a period of four hundred years.</p>
<p>When making the covenant with Abraham, God sovereignly made an environment of darkness in which He told Abraham that his descendants would suffer affliction for four hundred years. Thus, the fulfillment of this prophecy was a sign for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s covenant. By suffering the affliction as God prophesied, God&rsquo;s people were assured that He would fulfill His covenant.</p>
<p>God made a covenant with Abraham and said, &ldquo;To your seed do I give this land, / From the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates&rdquo; (Gen 15:18). God promised that Abraham&rsquo;s seed would be given a spacious land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates. The nation of Israel today has only a narrow strip of land, but the promised land is more spacious than this. In typology this means that after all the experiences of affliction, God&rsquo;s people will be expanded and become spacious. They will have a richer seed and a wider, broader land to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. All the Nations of the Earth<br />
Being Blessed in His Unique Seed&mdash;Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed (22:18; Gal. 3:16). In Galatians 3:16 Paul speaks of only one seed&mdash;Christ. We are all included in this one seed. We all are in Christ, and we are blessed because of Him. In Christ we have been justified. In Christ we are sanctified. In Christ we have the sonship. Everything related to us is in Christ. Ultimately, all the descendants of Abraham, including the heavenly stars and the sand on the seashore, will be in Christ. The New Jerusalem is the enlarged, corporate Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PROMISE TO ISAAC</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Inheriting the Promise Given to His Father</h2>
<p>Isaac inherited not only all that his father had but also the promise that God had given to his father concerning the good land and the unique seed, which is Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed (Gen. 26:3-5). This promise was for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose so that God might have a kingdom on the earth in which to express Himself through a corporate people. Both the good land and the seed are for the formation of a kingdom for God on the earth. In this kingdom God can be fully expressed in the seed, into which He will impart Himself and which will be transformed into His image. This was a promise given to Abraham and inherited by Isaac. This promise will be fulfilled in the New Testament believers. Through the enjoyment of grace the kingdom of God will be realized, and God in Christ will be fully expressed for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Gaining Twin Sons</h2>
<p>After twenty years of marriage without having a child, Isaac gained twin sons (Gen. 25:20-21, 26a). God promised that Isaac, the promised seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed. Suppose Isaac never had a son. How could this promise be fulfilled? How could God&rsquo;s purpose be accomplished? Thus, it was not only Isaac who needed a son but also God who needed a seed out of Isaac. Because Isaac did not realize this for twenty years, God did not do anything. After twenty years Isaac realized that he had such a need and that his need corresponded to God&rsquo;s need. He then prayed to God, and God answered his prayer. Eventually, Isaac had twin sons&mdash;Esau and Jacob. Jacob, who was chosen by God, not only fulfilled Isaac&rsquo;s need but also fulfilled God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Out of Jacob came Christ, who brings in the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PROMISE TO JACOB</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Fruitful and Multiplying</h2>
<p>In Genesis 35:11a God said to Jacob, &ldquo;I am the All-sufficient God: / Be fruitful and multiply.&rdquo; This is the first item of God&rsquo;s promise to Jacob. At Bethel God promised Jacob that he would be fruitful and multiply. Although this promise to Jacob was fulfilled by the Israelites, all the promises made to Israel are types. These promises in type are also for the church. All the saints in the church life need to believe this promise and claim its fulfillment. After a certain amount of time there will be thirtyfold, then sixtyfold, and then a hundredfold increase in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being a Nation with Kings</h2>
<p>God made another promise to Jacob, saying, &ldquo;A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, / And kings shall come forth from your loins&rdquo; (v. 11b). This verse first speaks of &ldquo;a company of nations,&rdquo; indicating multiplication, and then &ldquo;kings,&rdquo; indicating the kingdom. Following Jacob, there was the nation of his descendants. Then there was the kingdom of his descendants under David and Solomon. In New Testament times there is the kingdom under his descendant, Jesus Christ; in the next age there will be the millennial kingdom; and after that, the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and the new earth. This matter of kings coming forth from Jacob requires all the books in the Old Testament and all the books of the New Testament for its fulfillment. The church as God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth is also included in this promise. Furthermore, Revelation 11:15 speaks of the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise made to Jacob: &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Inheriting the Land with His Seed</h2>
<p>Still another aspect of God&rsquo;s promise to Jacob is in Genesis 35:12: &ldquo;The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, / I will give to you; / And I will give the land to your seed after you.&rdquo; In this verse Jacob is given the promise of inheriting the land with the seed. The land referred to in this verse is not simply the land of Palestine. That land is a type of Christ as the good land. Christ as the good land is what God promised to Jacob and his descendants for their possession.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The prophecies with promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are concerned not only with the blessing gained by God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament but also with the blessing that can be enjoyed by God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament. These prophecies with promises are concerned even with the situation in the coming age and in eternity. God promised Abraham that He would make of him a great nation, make his name great, and make him the father of a great nation. The nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity are all included in this great nation that God promised Abraham. God also promised to bless Abraham. This blessing consists of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption, including all that God wants to give man&mdash;God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come. God also promised Abraham that he would be a blessing to all the families, all the nations, of the earth. God promised to give Abraham a seed and that Abraham would gain the promised land. His seed would multiply like the stars in the heavens and like the sand on the seashore. Although this seed would suffer affliction, being afflicted for four hundred years, they would return to the land of Canaan. God blessed Abraham, and eventually he brought forth Christ as the unique seed. In Christ all the nations of the earth are blessed.</p>
<p>God promised Isaac that he would inherit the promise given to his father Abraham. Isaac inherited not only all that his father had but also the promise that God had given to his father concerning the good land and the unique seed. This seed eventually is Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth are blessed. God promised that Isaac would gain a son. Jacob, the son of Isaac, not only fulfilled Isaac&rsquo;s need but also fulfilled God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Out of Jacob came forth Christ, who brings in the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The first item that God promised Jacob is that God would be the All-sufficient God and that Jacob would be fruitful and multiply. God also promised Jacob that a nation and a company of nations would come from him and that kings would come out of his loins. Furthermore, Jacob and his seed after him would be given the land, which God gave to Abraham and Isaac. This land is not simply the land of Palestine. In reality it is Christ as the good land. Christ is what God promised Jacob and his descendants for their possession.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. JACOB PROPHESYING WITH BLESSING</h2>
<p>According to the record in Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually, Jacob became the father of a house that was chosen by God. This house, the house of Jacob (46:27), was composed of Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons. Later these twelve sons became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jacob&rsquo;s Words Being Prophecy<br />
as Well as Blessing</h2>
<p>The mature, strong, and weighty Jacob called his sons together when he was dying and said, &ldquo;Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days&rdquo; (49:1). This indicates that Genesis 49 contains an important prophecy. In fact, this portion of the Word can be said to be the deepest prophecy in the Bible. Jacob&rsquo;s words to his twelve sons are &ldquo;what their father spoke to them when he blessed them; he blessed them, each one according to his blessing&rdquo; (v. 28). Although this chapter is a prophecy, it is a prophecy saturated with blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jacob&rsquo;s Prophecies with Blessing Being Poetry</h2>
<p>The prophecies with blessing uttered by Jacob are poetry. We need to use allegories and signs in order to probe into the depths of their meaning because the poetic language is significant and descriptive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jacob&rsquo;s Prophecies Being<br />
the Conclusion of Genesis and<br />
Being Developed in the Remainder<br />
of the Old Testament and in the New Testament</h2>
<p>The prophecies in Genesis 49 are the conclusion of the book of Genesis. They are also the basis of the remainder of the Old Testament and the New Testament. This chapter of the Bible is a very rich seed that undergoes a marvelous development in the rest of the Scriptures. The prophecies in Genesis 49 are not only related to Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons. They are also closely related to the experience of the New Testament believers because the house of Israel typifies the church, and the church is God&rsquo;s house today.</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s first six prophecies concern Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar&mdash;the sons born of Leah, Jacob&rsquo;s proper wife. The last six concern Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali&mdash;the sons born of Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob&rsquo;s two female servants&mdash;and also Joseph and Benjamin&mdash;the sons born of Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved wife. In this lesson we will look at Jacob&rsquo;s first six prophecies with blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">II. CONCERNING REUBEN</h2>
<p>Jacob first prophesied concerning his eldest son, Reuben. In verse 3 Jacob said, &ldquo;Reuben, you are my firstborn, / My might and the firstfruits of my vigor, / Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.&rdquo; However, because Reuben was corrupted and defiled, in his prophecy with blessing Jacob specifically changed Reuben&rsquo;s status by birth as the firstborn.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Having Preeminence</h2>
<p>Because Reuben was boiling over with lust, he went up to his father&rsquo;s bed and defiled his father&rsquo;s couch. Hence, Jacob said that he would not have the preeminence (v. 4). The preeminence of Reuben&rsquo;s birthright was taken away.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Birthright Being Given to Joseph</h2>
<p>Before Jacob prophesied concerning Reuben in Genesis 49, he had already given the birthright to Joseph (48:5-6). In verse 5 Jacob said to Joseph, &ldquo;Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Double Portion of the Land<br />
Being Given to Joseph, the Kingship to Judah, and the Priesthood to Levi</h2>
<p>The birthright is composed of the double portion of the land, the kingship, and the priesthood. As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited all three blessings. However, due to his defilement, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph (48:22; cf. Josh. 16&mdash;17). In Genesis 48:22 Jacob said to Joseph, &ldquo;I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.&rdquo; Joseph received the double portion of the land, one for Ephraim and the other for Manasseh. Eventually, this prophecy was fulfilled in Joshua 16 and 17. When the children of Israel divided the land by lot, Joseph, who fled from the defilement of lust (Gen. 39:7-12), received the double portion of the land; but Reuben, who indulged in the defilement of lust, lost the right to the double portion of the land. This allotment was not accomplished through human maneuvering but through the sovereignty of God for the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy. Moreover, the kingship of Reuben&rsquo;s original birthright was given to Judah (1 Chron. 5:2), and the priesthood was given to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CONCERNING SIMEON AND LEVI</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Receiving No Blessing because of Their Cruelty but Being Cursed Instead</h2>
<p>Jacob considered Simeon and Levi as companions when he spoke concerning them. Jacob said, &ldquo;Simeon and Levi are brothers; / Weapons of violence are their swords. / Come not into their council, O my soul; / Be not united with their assembly, O my glory; / For in their anger they slew men, / And in their self-will they hamstrung oxen&rdquo; (Gen. 49:5-6). <em>Glory</em> in verse 6 refers to the spirit. Jacob was greatly shocked by what Simeon and Levi did in Genesis 34. Jacob had never been so frightened in his whole life. Simeon&rsquo;s and Levi&rsquo;s disposition left a deep impression in Jacob&rsquo;s spirit that he could not forget. Therefore, although Jacob loved them, he could not give them any blessing. Instead, he cursed their fierce anger and cruel wrath (49:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Scattered in Israel</h2>
<p>Jacob was frightened by Simeon&rsquo;s and Levi&rsquo;s cruel disposition. Therefore, Jacob would not allow them to dwell together. Rather, he exercised judgment over them in his prophecy, dividing them in Jacob and scattering them in Israel (v. 7). In this way, they would not be able to behave cruelly according to their disposition. According to the record in Joshua, Simeon was eventually scattered among the people of Judah (19:1, 9), and Levi was scattered among the people of Israel (ch. 21). Through the casting of lots, Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies concerning them were fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Scattering of Levi<br />
Becoming a Blessing to the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>Although Jacob prophesied that Levi would be scattered in Israel, the descendants of Levi were blessed because of Levi&rsquo;s faithfulness and absoluteness to God (Exo. 32:26-28), and their scattering also became a blessing to the children of Israel. In Numbers 35:2 Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;Command the children of Israel to give to the Levites some of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around their cities.&rdquo; The selection of these cities was by lot. Altogether, the Levites were given forty-eight cities (v. 6). Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, out of these forty-eight cities six were to be cities of refuge (Josh. 20:7-9). Three were on the east side of the Jordan, and three were on the west side. Anyone among the people of Israel who killed a person by mistake could easily flee to one of these cities of refuge. Therefore, the scattering of Levi according to the curse became a blessing. The scattered Levites brought God&rsquo;s refuge to people who sinned. Thus, in ancient times it was a blessing to have some Levites in your city or in your territory (Judg. 17:7-13).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. CONCERNING JUDAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Praised and Worshipped by His Brothers</h2>
<p>Concerning Judah, Jacob prophesied: &ldquo;Judah, your brothers will praise you; / Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; / Your father&rsquo;s sons will bow down before you&rdquo; (Gen. 49:8). This means that Judah&rsquo;s brothers would praise him and worship him for his victory. From among Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons, Christ came out of Judah. Because Christ came out of Judah, He belongs to Judah. In Revelation 5:5 Christ is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Therefore, in prophesying about his son Judah, Jacob was actually prophesying that Christ would be praised, that His hand would be placed on the neck of His enemies, and that His brothers would bow down before Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Young Lion Conquering the Enemies<br />
and a Lion and a Lioness Resting in Conquest</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:9 says, &ldquo;Judah is a young lion; / From the prey, my son, you have gone up. / He couches, he stretches out like a lion, / And like a lioness.&rdquo; When a lion goes after prey, he descends from his dwelling place in the mountain. While he waits to seize his prey, he crouches. After he has taken his prey, he brings it up the mountain with him. Thus, the phrase <em>from the prey, my son, you have gone up</em> means that the lion has gone up the mountain to devour his prey. After eating the prey, the lion no longer crouches. Instead, he couches; that is, he lies down. This indicates that after swallowing his prey, he is satisfied and lies down to rest.</p>
<p>When Christ was waiting for His prey, He was a young lion crouching. After seizing His prey, He brought His captives to the heavens. This is according to Ephesians 4:8, which says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; This train of captives was Christ&rsquo;s prey. After enjoying the prey He captured, Christ is satisfied and is now resting on the throne in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Producing Kings</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:10 says, &ldquo;The scepter will not depart from Judah, / Nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, / Until Shiloh comes, / And to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&rdquo; The scepter denotes the scepter of the kingship, or the kingdom. Psalm 45:6 says, &ldquo;The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rdquo; The scepter, a symbol of the kingdom, refers to the kingly authority of Christ. Thus, the scepter in Genesis 49:10 refers to Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, Christ&rsquo;s kingship. The scepter never departing from Judah means that the kingship will never depart from Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrew poetry is written in pairs. Hence, &ldquo;the ruler&rsquo;s staff&rdquo; in Genesis 49:10 is synonymous with &ldquo;the scepter.&rdquo; Undoubtedly, the ruler here is Christ. The Hebrew word translated &ldquo;ruler&rdquo; in this verse means &ldquo;lawgiver.&rdquo; Christ is the One who gives the law, for He has the staff and the scepter.</p>
<p>This verse says that the ruler&rsquo;s staff will not depart from &ldquo;between his feet.&rdquo; The phrase <em>between his feet</em> is a poetic term denoting seed or posterity. Thus, it refers to Judah&rsquo;s descendants. This means that the tribe of Judah will always have kings. According to 1 Chronicles 5:2 Judah has the kingship, and rulers come out of his posterity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Having Shiloh</h2>
<p>This authority will continue until Shiloh comes. The word <em>Shiloh</em> means &ldquo;peace bringer.&rdquo; Most Bible teachers agree that Shiloh refers to Christ in His second coming. When Christ comes the second time, He will come as the Prince of peace, as the One who brings peace. At that time, the whole earth will be filled with peace.</p>
<p>Genesis 49:10 also says, &ldquo;To Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&rdquo; The peoples are the nations. At the second coming of Christ, all the nations will submit to Him and obey Him. Isaiah 2:2-3 and 11:10 indicate that from the beginning of the millennium, at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, all the nations will obey Christ. They will come to Him to receive God&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Rich in Wine and Milk</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:11 speaks of &ldquo;binding his foal to the vine, / And his donkey&rsquo;s colt to the choice vine, / He washes his garment in wine, / And his robe in the blood of grapes.&rdquo; In the Bible a donkey signifies a person who labors very hard, especially in the matter of transportation. Even the Lord Jesus rode upon a donkey into the city of Jerusalem (Matt. 21:5, 7). Although a donkey is usually used for labor in travel, the donkey in Genesis 49:11 is not laboring; it is bound to the vine. This signifies that labor was over, that the destination had been reached, and that rest had begun. Any donkey used for long journeys would certainly enjoy being bound to a fruitful vine full of vegetation.</p>
<p>Verse 11 also speaks of wine, which is the produce of the vine and signifies the riches of the harvest. The second part of verse 11 says, &ldquo;He washes his garment in wine, / And his robe in the blood of grapes.&rdquo; This indicates that there is an abundance of wine such that people not only drink it but can even wash their clothes in it. This truly shows the end of labor and the beginning of rest in the enjoyment of the riches. When the donkeys can enjoy rest, it is no longer a time for sowing seed but a time for reaping the harvest. Thus, this verse is a poetic description of the millennium, the coming age of the thousand years. In this coming age labor will cease, and instead of labor there will be rest. There will be the rich enjoyment of an abundant harvest.</p>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Dark are his eyes with wine, / And white are his teeth with milk.&rdquo; Along with the wine, there is milk. The source of wine is the vineyards, and the source of milk is the sheepfolds spoken of in verse 14. Milk signifies the nourishment of life that satisfies us. The calcium contained in milk produces healthy white teeth. When the millennium comes and the donkeys are bound and labor is over, the produce of the rich harvest will be so adequate that people will have eyes that are red with wine and teeth that are strong and white.</p><h2 class="head1">V. CONCERNING ZEBULUN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Dwelling at the Shore of the Sea and<br />
Being a Shore for Ships</h2>
<p>After Judah, Jacob spoke of Zebulun. Genesis 49:13 says, &ldquo;Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, / And he will be a shore for ships.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this verse is in Matthew 4:15, which says, &ldquo;Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus began His ministry of preaching the gospel of the kingdom from Galilee. Not only so, after His resurrection He met with the disciples again in Galilee and said to them, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (28:7, 16, 19). Acts 1:11 reveals that the first preachers of the gospel were men of Galilee. In verse 8 the Lord told the Galileans, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; According to allegorical interpretation, Acts 1:8 is the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy. Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, and he will be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. His Flank Being toward Sidon</h2>
<p>Jacob also prophesied that Zebulun&rsquo;s flank, his border, would be toward Sidon (Gen 49:13). Sidon was a heathen city outside the Holy Land. It was located on the sea, and from it the sea traffic went to the uttermost part of the earth. The early preachers all sailed from the Holy Land to Asia Minor and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, Rome, and Spain. The apostle Paul took a ship from the Holy Land and sailed first to Sidon and eventually to Rome (Acts 27:3; 28:14). The history of preaching the gospel to the Gentile world in Acts fulfills the prophecy that Zebulun&rsquo;s &ldquo;flank will be toward Sidon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. CONCERNING ISSACHAR</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being a Strong Donkey Couching<br />
between the Sheepfolds</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:14 says, &ldquo;Issachar is a strong donkey, / Couching between the sheepfolds.&rdquo; In biblical interpretation this verse is linked to the foal and the colt in verse 11. The colt in verse 11 is tied to the rich harvest. Hence, in verse 14 the strong donkey is couching, resting. Issachar is not working. He is couching. He is lying down and resting between the sheepfolds.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Enjoying Rest in the Rich Land and<br />
Becoming a Task-worker to Bring Tribute</h2>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;He saw a resting place that was good / And the land that was pleasant, / And he bowed his shoulder to bear, / And became a task-worker to bring tribute.&rdquo; Issachar, the strong donkey, is resting and enjoying the pleasant, rich land. He also bows his shoulder to bear burdens, and thus he becomes a servant under taskwork. This means that he serves in order to have something to offer to the Lord. Hence, this verse speaks of him being &ldquo;a task-worker to bring tribute.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s people do not labor as hard-working donkeys. Rather, they rest as strong donkeys. While they are resting, they enjoy the riches of Christ. Through the enjoyment of these riches, they become willing to bow their shoulder, take up a burden, and serve for tribute rendered to the King. This will be completely fulfilled in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s speaking before his death in Genesis 49 can be said to be the deepest prophecy in the Bible. It is also Jacob&rsquo;s blessing of his twelve sons. These prophecies are the conclusion of the book of Genesis and are developed in the remainder of the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies are not related only to his twelve sons; they are also closely related to the experience of the New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The first six sons mentioned in Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies are Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar&mdash;the sons born of Leah, Jacob&rsquo;s proper wife. The last six sons mentioned are Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali&mdash;the sons born of Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob&rsquo;s two female servants&mdash;and also Joseph and Benjamin&mdash;the sons born of Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved wife. By birth Reuben was the firstborn, but because he was corrupted and defiled, Jacob prophesied that he would not have the preeminence. The preeminence of his birthright was taken away from him. Eventually, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah, and the priesthood was given to Levi. Simeon and Levi received no blessing because of their cruelty. Rather, they were cursed and scattered in Israel. However, the scattering of Levi became a blessing to the children of Israel. Judah was to be praised and worshipped by his brothers. He was a young lion conquering the enemies and a lion and lioness resting in conquest. The scepter would not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh, the &ldquo;peace-bringer,&rdquo; comes, and to Him would be the obedience of the peoples. Judah would also be rich in wine and milk; his labor would be over, and his rest in rich enjoyment would begin. Zebulun would dwell at the shore of the sea and would be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom. His flank would be toward Sidon, indicating that the gospel would spread to the Gentile world. Issachar was a strong donkey, couching between the sheepfolds. He would enjoy rest in the rich land and become a task-worker to bring tribute. This indicates that God&rsquo;s people will rest while enjoying the riches of Christ.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to look at Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies with blessing for his twelve sons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. CONCERNING DAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Judging His People as<br />
One of the Tribes (Scepters) of Israel</h2>
<p>In Genesis 49:16 Jacob prophesied, &ldquo;Dan will judge his people, / As one of the tribes of Israel.&rdquo; This indicates that Jacob was concerned that Dan would be cut off. According to the Mosaic law, anyone who set up or worshipped an idol had to be cut off from the people (Deut. 13:5-18). After the Israelites entered the good land, the tribe of Dan brought in an idol among the twelve tribes. Thus, Dan should have been terminated as a tribe. However, Jacob, not wanting to see one of his sons cut off, blessed him prophetically out of a loving heart, saying that Dan would still be a tribe judging his people. This word was particularly fulfilled in Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan (Judg. 13:2, 24; 15:20).</p>
<p>Jacob said that Dan would judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. The Hebrew word translated &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; first has the meaning of &ldquo;branch,&rdquo; then &ldquo;stick, staff, and scepter.&rdquo; A scepter signifies authority. Therefore, the word <em>tribe</em> actually means &ldquo;scepter.&rdquo; Every tribe has a scepter, an authority. The twelve tribes were twelve scepters, twelve powers, twelve authorities. During the time of Samson, the tribe of Dan certainly became a scepter. With Samson the tribe of Dan was a power, a real authority. This was the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s prophetic blessing concerning Dan in Genesis 49:16. Jacob&rsquo;s word meant not only that Dan would remain as a tribe but also that Dan would be a scepter, an authority. This prophecy has been fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being a Serpent in the Way,<br />
a Viper on the Path</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Jacob continued, &ldquo;Dan will be a serpent in the way, / A viper on the path, / That bites the horse&rsquo;s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.&rdquo; The serpent in this verse is worse than the serpent in Genesis 3, because it is a viper. Dan eventually became a serpent, even a viper, because the tribe of Dan set up another center of worship. After the tribe of Dan obtained the city of Dan in Judges 18, an idol made by Micah was set up in it (17:4-5; 18:17, 27, 30-31). At that time God&rsquo;s tabernacle was in Shiloh, but in the city of Dan there was an idol. The tribe of Dan not only set up a divisive center of worship in the good land but also appointed and hired their own priests (v. 30; 1 Kings 12:29-31). This made Dan one with Satan in bringing in stumbling blocks to frustrate God&rsquo;s people. Therefore, Jacob prophesied that Dan &ldquo;bites the horse&rsquo;s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In chapters 2 through 9 of 1 Chronicles the tribe of Dan was omitted in the record of the holy people of God. Dan&rsquo;s name is mentioned in 2:2 but in the following record his tribe was omitted. Furthermore, the tribe of Dan is also not mentioned in the record in Revelation 7. The tribe of Dan did not perish. Dan&rsquo;s name was omitted in the record in 1 Chronicles and Revelation because he fell and became one with God&rsquo;s enemy, becoming a viper and bringing in a stumbling block to God&rsquo;s people. Notwithstanding, Dan will still be a tribe in the millennium because of his father&rsquo;s blessing (Ezek. 48:1). This prophecy is certainly a picture of God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. CONCERNING GAD</h2>
<p>Because of the failure of Dan, Jacob prophesied in Genesis 49:19, saying, &ldquo;Gad, raiders will raid him, / But he will raid at their heel.&rdquo; With Dan there is defeat, but with Gad victory is brought back. Dan ends with failure, but Gad, who will raid at the heel of the raiders, comes in with the recovered victory.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. CONCERNING ASHER</h2>
<p>After prophesying concerning Gad, Jacob spoke concerning Asher. Genesis 49:20 says, &ldquo;Asher&rsquo;s food will be rich, / And he will yield royal dainties.&rdquo; The word <em>rich</em> literally means &ldquo;fat.&rdquo; Hence, Asher&rsquo;s bread is fat. This means that his food is rich. This rich food even becomes royal dainties, the royal food.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. CONCERNING NAPHTALI</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being a Hind Let Loose</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:21 says, &ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning the resurrected Christ as a hind let loose, skipping on the mountaintops. Nothing can frustrate Him, and no one needs to pave the way for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Giving Beautiful Words</h2>
<p>Verse 21 also says, &ldquo;He gives beautiful words.&rdquo; The resurrected hind in Genesis 49 corresponds to the resurrected Lord in Matthew 28. After Christ was risen, He gathered the disciples together and charged them, saying, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations,...teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (vv. 19-20). The disciples&rsquo; teaching all the nations all that the Lord commanded them was the giving of beautiful words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. CONCERNING JOSEPH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being a Fruitful Bough by a Fountain</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:22 says, &ldquo;Joseph is a fruitful bough, / A fruitful bough by a fountain; / His branches run over the wall.&rdquo; Joseph is a fruitful bough. Therefore, the fruitful tree must be Jacob. Jacob had twelve sons. Twelve is the number of eternal completion. The fact that Jacob had twelve sons shows that he was very fruitful; he was a fruitful tree. His son Joseph was a bough of this tree and was also fruitful.</p>
<p>When Joseph&rsquo;s father and eleven brothers and their families came down to Egypt, they became channels for the branching out of Joseph&rsquo;s fruitfulness. At that time in Egypt Joseph was not simply branching out personally; he was branching out God&rsquo;s administration with seventy people (Exo. 1:5). Eventually, the entire world was under the branching out of Joseph. The picture of Joseph&rsquo;s fruitfulness and branching out is being fulfilled through the church. Acts 2 reveals the fruitfulness of Peter and the other eleven apostles. Throughout the centuries, all those who have loved the Lord and who have been occupied with Him have also been fruitful.</p>
<p>As a fruitful person, Jacob signifies the producing God. God is a fruitful tree. This is seen in John 15 where Christ, as the embodiment of God, is portrayed as a producing tree. In the Old Testament Christ is also called a branch (Isa. 11:1). On the one hand, the Bible says that Christ is a tree, and on the other hand, it says that He is a branch. He is both. As the embodiment of God, He is a tree, but as the branching out of God, He is a branch. Joseph, a type of Christ, as part of Jacob the fruitful father, was a bough of the fruitful tree and also a branch that branches out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. His Branches Running over the Wall</h2>
<p>Allegorically, Genesis 49:22 prophesies that Joseph will move out beyond the wall. Joseph was not limited to the good land; he ran over the wall into Egypt, spreading beyond the limits of the good land into another region. In typology this indicates that the children of God are spreading Christ over every restriction and magnifying Him in every circumstance (Phil. 1:20). A wall signifies restriction. Since the day of Pentecost, wall after wall has been erected to restrict the spreading of the branches. One day Peter was put into prison (Acts 12:3-4). But not even that stronghold could restrict the branching out of Christ. Year after year, decade after decade, and century after century, walls have been raised up by the opposers and by the enemy to restrict the fruitfulness of God&rsquo;s children. However, the branches run over the wall every time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Helped by the God of His Father and Blessed by the All-sufficient One</h2>
<p>Jacob prophesied that his God would help Joseph and that the All-sufficient One would bless him. Genesis 49:25 says, &ldquo;From the God of your father, who will help you, / And from the All-sufficient One, who will bless you.&rdquo; When we combine the blessings mentioned in 49:25-26 with those in Deuteronomy 33:13-16, we see that there were ten aspects to the blessings bestowed upon Joseph. First, he was blessed with the choicest things of heaven (v. 13). Certainly some of the blessings of the choicest things of heaven should include rain and snow. Second, he was blessed with the dew. Third, he was blessed with the deep waters that couch beneath. This refers to the springs, fountains, and waters underneath the earth (v. 13). Fourth, he was blessed with the choicest of the crops of the sun. Fifth, he had the blessing of the choicest of the yield of the moons (v. 14). The sixth blessing he received was the blessing of the top of the ancient mountains, and the seventh was the choicest things of the eternal hills (v. 15). In these blessings all of time and space is included. From the ancient mountains to the eternal hills means that all time is included, and from heaven to earth, including the deep under the earth, means that all space is included. This indicates that all the good things in the universe have become blessings to Joseph. The eighth blessing includes the choicest things of the earth and its fullness (v. 16). Certainly this must include minerals, such as gold and silver. The ninth blessing is seen in Genesis 49:25: &ldquo;Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.&rdquo; This refers to the producing of life. This is the only blessing that is of life. The tenth blessing is &ldquo;the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush&rdquo; (Deut. 33:16; cf. Exo. 3:4). The One who dwelt in the bush dwelt in the temple; now He dwells in the church, and eventually, He will dwell in the New Jerusalem. This is the very desire of God&rsquo;s heart, His good pleasure. All these things are included in the universal blessing bestowed upon Joseph.</p>
<p>All these blessings are the inheritance of Christ, typified by Joseph. Hebrews 1:2 says that God appointed Christ as Heir of all things. All the good things throughout time and space are the inheritance of Christ. This is God&rsquo;s blessing to Christ, and Joseph represents Christ. All the blessings of the Father go to Him. The New Testament says that all things have been given to the Son. Because we are His partners, we join Him to inherit all these blessings (Heb. 3:14; Rom. 8:17). All the things in time from ancient times to eternity, everything in space from heaven to underneath the earth, and all the producing and nourishing aspects of life are the blessings bestowed upon Christ. Christ, typified by Joseph, was the One separate from His brothers (Gen. 49:26), and as such, He has received the blessing of the whole universe.</p><h2 class="head1">XII. CONCERNING BENJAMIN</h2>
<p>When Benjamin was born, his mother named him Ben-oni (35:18), which means &ldquo;son of my affliction.&rdquo; But his father changed his name to Benjamin, which means &ldquo;son of the right hand&rdquo; and signifies the ascended and exalted Christ. Genesis 49:27 says, &ldquo;Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, / In the morning devouring the prey / And in the evening dividing the spoil.&rdquo; In Hebrew, the word translated as &ldquo;ravenous&rdquo; means &ldquo;tearing,&rdquo; that is, to tear into pieces. Benjamin, as a tearing wolf, is also a type of Christ. The ascended and exalted Christ is not only the overcoming One but also the tearing One, the One who eats His enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIII. GOD&rsquo;S HONORING AND FULFILLING<br />
JACOB&rsquo;S PROPHECIES</h2>
<p>As Jacob was dying, he prophesied concerning his twelve sons (vv. 1-2). Jacob did not prophesy by saying, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; Rather, he prophesied by being one with God to speak for God. Whatever Jacob spoke became God&rsquo;s word. Jacob was God&rsquo;s mouthpiece. The fact that Jacob could prophesy in such a way is a strong sign and manifestation that he was matured in life. God honored and fulfilled the prophetic blessing pronounced by Jacob upon his twelve sons.</p>
<p>Genesis 49 contains the essence of the entire Bible, and it is a summary of the history of Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons, the history of Israel, the history of the church, and the individual spiritual history of God&rsquo;s people. Although this chapter is poetic and profound, it is rather brief. This chapter is all-inclusive; it includes the essence of the entire Bible. How wonderful it is!</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Jacob prophesied that Dan would judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. After the Israelites entered the good land, the tribe of Dan brought in an idol and became one with God&rsquo;s enemy, becoming a serpent in the way, a viper on the path, and bringing in a stumbling block to God&rsquo;s people. Thus, they should have been terminated as a tribe. However, Jacob, not wanting to see one of his sons cut off, blessed him prophetically out of a loving heart by saying that Dan would still be a tribe judging his people. Although his name was omitted in the record in 1 Chronicles and Revelation, Dan will still be a tribe in the millennium because of his father&rsquo;s blessing. Concerning Gad, Jacob prophesied, saying, &ldquo;Gad, raiders will raid him, / But he will raid at their heel.&rdquo; Concerning Asher, Jacob prophesied, saying, &ldquo;Asher&rsquo;s food will be rich, / And he will yield royal dainties.&rdquo; Naphtali is a hind let loose. This prophecy concerns the resurrected Christ skipping on the mountaintops; nothing can frustrate Him, and no one needs to pave the way for Him. Concerning Joseph, Jacob said that he is a fruitful bough by a fountain, whose branches ran over the wall. He was not limited to the good land, but he ran over the wall to Egypt. This typifies the children of God spreading Christ over every restriction and magnifying Him in every circumstance. Opposers and the enemy have raised up walls to restrict the fruitfulness of God&rsquo;s children, but the branches run over the wall every time. The combined blessings bestowed upon Joseph were of ten aspects. First, he was blessed with the choicest things of heaven; second, he was blessed with the dew; third, he was blessed with the blessing of the deep that lies beneath; fourth, he was blessed with the choicest of the crops of the sun; fifth, he was blessed with the choicest of the yield of the moons; sixth, he was blessed with receiving the top of the ancient mountains; seventh, he was blessed with the choicest things of the eternal hills; eighth, he was blessed with the choicest things of the earth and its fullness; ninth, he was blessed with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb, which relate to life; tenth, he was blessed with the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush. Concerning Benjamin, Jacob prophesied that he was &ldquo;a ravenous wolf, / In the morning devouring the prey / And in the evening dividing the spoil.&rdquo; This means that the ascended and exalted Christ is not only the overcoming One but also the tearing One, the One who eats His enemy. Genesis 49, which contains Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies, is the essence of the entire Bible. It is a summary of the history of Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons, the history of Israel, the history of the church, and the individual spiritual history of God&rsquo;s people. This chapter is poetic and very profound, yet it is rather brief. It is all-inclusive; it includes the essence of the entire Bible. How wonderful it is!</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were formed into an army to fight for God on their journey. This fighting army journeyed so that God would gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom and His house. Before entering the good land, the children of Israel defeated the kings of Arad, of the Amorites, and of Bashan on the east of the Jordan, destroying their cities and taking over their land (Num. 21:1-3, 21-35). After the children of Israel defeated these three kings, they were ready to cross the Jordan and enter into the good land. Being unable to defeat the children of Israel politically or militarily, the enemy changed his mode of fighting against them and decided to take the religious way to defeat God&rsquo;s people. Hence, Balak, the king of Moab, joined with Midian and sent elders to induce Balaam to come and curse the children of Israel for them (chs. 22&mdash;25).</p>
<p>God deterred Balaam, but Balaam insisted on going. Then God allowed him to go but charged him to speak only what the Angel of Jehovah would speak to him. Balaam had the desire and intention in his heart to curse Israel so that he might please Balak and receive money. As the One who was watching and ruling, however, Jehovah put a word in Balaam&rsquo;s mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God&rsquo;s word. Hence, Balaam did not speak curses; instead, he spoke four parables concerning Israel. In Balaam&rsquo;s parables there are many prophecies concerning the house of Israel, the nations, and the Messiah. In this lesson we will consider these marvelous prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE FIRST PARABLE</h2>
<p>Balaam&rsquo;s first parable is in Numbers 22:41 through 23:12. &ldquo;In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the Bamoth-baal, and he saw from there the edge of the people&rdquo; (v. 41). <em>Bamoth-baal</em> means &ldquo;the high places of Baal.&rdquo; In the Old Testament the high places were places where people worshipped idols. Baal was the name of an idol. Therefore, Bamoth-baal was the place where people worshipped the idol of Baal. &ldquo;Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here. And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken&rdquo; (23:1-2). While Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam&rsquo;s burnt offering (vv. 3, 6), Jehovah put a word in Balaam&rsquo;s mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a parable (vv. 4-5, 7-10). Balaam&rsquo;s words were inspired by God. The human mind is not able to compose such a parable. Let us now consider certain aspects of Balaam&rsquo;s first parable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel Being a People<br />
Who Live Alone and Do Not Reckon Themselves among the Nations</h2>
<p>Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Come, curse Jacob for me; / And come, denounce Israel!&rdquo; (v. 7). However, this was impossible because Balaam said, &ldquo;How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? / And how can I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced? / For from the top of the rocks I see him, / And from the hills I behold him. / Here is a people who live alone / And do not reckon themselves among the nations&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). This word about the children of Israel&rsquo;s living alone and not reckoning themselves among the nations indicates that they were a holy, sanctified people, a people set apart from the nations unto God.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes Israel lives alone. According to God&rsquo;s view, even today Israel is still not reckoned among the nations. If we have God&rsquo;s view, we will see that Israel is a particular, separate people, a holy nation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. &ldquo;Who Can Count the Dust of Jacob, /<br />
Or Number the Fourth Part of Israel?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In verse 10 Balaam went on to say, &ldquo;Who can count the dust of Jacob, / Or number the fourth part of Israel? / Let me die the death of the upright, / And let my latter end be like theirs!&rdquo; This verse contains the blessing of increase. Jacob will be innumerable, uncountable, like the dust. No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel.</p>
<p>The first parable is a blessing upon the children of Israel as a separate people, a particular and special class of people who live alone and who are not reckoned among the nations. Because this people will be blessed with abundant increase, no one will be able to count them. Balaam&rsquo;s word of blessing and appreciation concerning Israel offended Balak. For this reason, Balak said to him, &ldquo;What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them&rdquo; (v. 11). Balaam replied, &ldquo;Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?&rdquo; (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECOND PARABLE</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 26 we see Balaam&rsquo;s second parable. Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Come now with me to another place from which you may see them. You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there. So he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam&rsquo;s burnt offering while Jehovah put a word in Balaam&rsquo;s mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a second parable (vv. 15-24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God Not Beholding Iniquity in Jacob<br />
Nor Seeing Trouble in Israel</h2>
<p>One of the most striking lines in this parable is in verse 21: &ldquo;He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel.&rdquo; Balaam&rsquo;s word was spoken not according to the human view but according to the divine view. God&rsquo;s view is different from man&rsquo;s view. It is obvious that the children of Israel had many iniquities, but God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves. God&rsquo;s redeemed people have a twofold status: their status in themselves and their status in God&rsquo;s redemption. Balaam&rsquo;s prophecy indicates that God cares for His people&rsquo;s status in His redemption.</p>
<p>The word <em>trouble</em> means &ldquo;hard things, evil things.&rdquo; Trouble is even worse than iniquity. In the sight of God there was neither iniquity nor trouble in His people Israel.</p>
<p>God surely had the standing to say that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob nor see trouble in Israel. His people had been redeemed and forgiven; therefore, God could say that they were without iniquity. Balaam, under the control and inspiration of God, had no choice but to declare that God did not behold iniquity or see trouble in the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having the Shout of a King</h2>
<p>In verse 21 Balaam also said, &ldquo;Jehovah their God is with them, / And the shout of a king is among them.&rdquo; Ultimately, this king refers to Christ. Thus, the shout of a king among them means that the shout of Christ is among them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Having the Horns of the Wild Ox,<br />
and There Being Nothing against Him;<br />
a People Rising Up like a Lioness<br />
and Lifting Themselves Up like a Lion</h2>
<p>Verse 22 speaks of God bringing His people out of Egypt. This verse also says that Israel has &ldquo;the horns of the wild ox.&rdquo; Verse 23 says that there is neither enchantment nor divination against Israel, for &ldquo;now it shall be said of Jacob / And of Israel, What has God wrought!&rdquo; The second parable concludes in verse 24, saying, &ldquo;See, a people rises up like a lioness, / And like a lion they lift themselves up. / They shall not lie down until they eat the prey / And drink the blood of the slain.&rdquo; The lioness, the lion, and the horns of the wild ox all refer to the fighting power of the people of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE THIRD PARABLE</h2>
<p>After the second parable, Balak said, &ldquo;Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.&rdquo; (v. 27). Then Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor (v. 28). &ldquo;Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here. And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). &ldquo;When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments&rdquo; (24:1). Rather, Balaam &ldquo;set his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him. And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor declares, / And the man whose eye is opened declares; / He declares, he who hears the words of God, / Who sees the vision of the All-sufficient One, / Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered&rdquo; (vv. 1-4). <em>Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered</em> indicates that he cooperated with God in the third parable.</p><h2 class="head2">A. &ldquo;How Fair Are Your Tents, O Jacob, /<br />
Your Tabernacles, O Israel!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In verse 5 Balaam said, &ldquo;How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your tabernacles, O Israel!&rdquo; According to the third parable, Israel is beautiful. Israel&rsquo;s beauty is indicated by the word <em>fair.</em> In the first parable Israel is holy, in the second parable she is sinless, and in the third she is beautiful. Hence, in the sight of God Israel is holy, sinless, and beautiful. In standing she is holy, in kind she is perfect, and in appearance she is beautiful. This reveals that God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified this people.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, this will be the actual situation of Israel during the millennium. In this age the Jews are not welcomed by the nations, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back. God promised that the descendants of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations (Gen. 12:2-3). Eventually the Jews will be fully blessed by God, and they will be a blessing to the entire human race.</p>
<p>In Numbers 24:6 Balaam continued his description of Israel: &ldquo;Like valleys they are spread forth, / Like gardens beside a river, / Like aloes which Jehovah has planted, / Like cedars beside water.&rdquo; In this verse Israel is likened to valleys, which usually are green, and to gardens beside a river. Aloe is a plant known for its healing effect; the Lord Jesus was buried in linen with a mixture of myrrh and aloes (John 19:39). Hence, Numbers 24:6 is a prophecy. After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing. Numbers 24:7 says, &ldquo;Water shall flow from his buckets, / And his seed shall be in many waters.&rdquo; This indicates that Israel will have an abundant supply of water. The water of a country is related to the riches of that country. Without water, land becomes a desert. The more water a nation has, the richer it is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The King of Israel Being Higher Than Agag, and His Kingdom Being Exalted</h2>
<p>In verse 7 Balaam went on to say, &ldquo;His king shall be higher than Agag, / And his kingdom shall be exalted.&rdquo; Agag was the king of the Amalekites. Balaam&rsquo;s word is a prophecy that eventually has its fulfillment in Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Balaam ended his third parable with a word concerning blessing and cursing: &ldquo;Blessed is everyone who blesses you, / And cursed is everyone who curses you.&rdquo; This bothered Balak. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Then Balak&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them these three times.&rdquo; In verses 12 and 13 Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad from my own heart? What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE FOURTH PARABLE</h2>
<p>In 24:14-25 Balaam spoke a fourth parable. In verse 14 Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Now therefore, I am going to my people. Come, let me give you counsel as to what this people will do to your people in the last days.&rdquo; Balaam not only blessed Israel but also prophesied that Israel would be blessed further and that Israel&rsquo;s blessing would be a damage to Balak and his people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. &ldquo;There Shall Come Forth a Star out of Jacob, / And a Scepter Shall Rise out of Israel&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Balaam said, &ldquo;I see Him, but not now; / I behold Him, but not near. / There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob, / And a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, / And He shall crush the corners of Moab / And break down all the sons of Sheth.&rdquo; Both <em>Star</em> and <em>Scepter</em> refer to Christ. The Scepter is Christ as the One with power and authority. The greatest blessing to the children of Israel is Christ. As the Star and the Scepter, Christ will be the almighty One with all-inclusive power and authority. Christ will crush the corners of Moab, Balak&rsquo;s country and break down all the sons of Sheth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Nations Being Destroyed<br />
and Jacob Having Dominion</h2>
<p>In verses 18 and 19 Balaam continued, saying, &ldquo;Edom shall be dispossessed&mdash; / Seir, His enemies, shall also be dispossessed&mdash; / While Israel does valiantly. / And One from Jacob shall have dominion / And destroy the remnant from the city.&rdquo; The enemies in verse 18 are Christ&rsquo;s enemies. These enemies will be destroyed, but Israel will remain because of Christ. After the nations have been destroyed, Israel will remain with Christ. Christ will surely be Israel&rsquo;s greatest blessing. As the New Testament indicates, this prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the coming days, that is, in the millennium.</p>
<p>In Numbers 24:20-25, Balaam prophesied in a parable concerning other nations. These verses help us to realize that God is over all. All the nations are under His control and His reign for the fulfillment of His purpose. He rules over the nations so that His economy may be accomplished among the nations through Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Balaam spoke four parables to Israel in which there are many prophecies concerning the house of Israel, the nations, and the Messiah. The first parable speaks of the children of Israel being a people who live alone and who do not reckon themselves among the nations. They are a holy people, a people separated from among the nations unto God. Because they are blessed, they received abundant increase. They are as numberless as dust. No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel. In the second parable Balaam said that God did not behold iniquity in Jacob, nor did He see trouble in Israel. It is obvious that the children of Israel had many iniquities, but God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves. In God&rsquo;s eyes His people have been redeemed and forgiven; therefore, God can say that they are without iniquity. God is with them, and the shout of a king is among them. They are full of fighting power, having the horns of the wild ox, and nothing is against them. They rise up like a lioness and lift themselves up like a lion. In the third parable Balaam said that the tents of Jacob are fair, and the tabernacles of Israel are beautiful. In the sight of God Israel is holy, sinless, and beautiful. God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified His people. Israel will be like valleys that spread forth, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, and like cedars beside water. The king of Israel will be higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted. Everyone who blesses Israel will be blessed, and everyone who curses Israel will be cursed. The fourth parable speaks of a Star coming forth out of Jacob and a Scepter rising out of Israel. Both the Star and the Scepter refer to Christ. He is the almighty One with all-inclusive power and authority. He will crush the corners of Moab, Balak&rsquo;s country, and break down all the sons of Sheth. Then the nations will be destroyed, and Jacob will have dominion. This proves that God is over all; all the nations are under His control and His reign for the fulfillment of His purpose. He rules over the nations so that His economy may be accomplished among the nations through Israel.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel journeyed from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea, the entry to the good land. This was an eleven-day journey (Deut. 1:2). At that time, Jehovah God set the promised good land before them, and Moses told them to be bold and go up and possess the land as God had spoken to them (vv. 19-21). Although the spies sent by the children of Israel brought back word that the land was an exceedingly good land, a land which flowed with milk and honey (v. 25; Num. 13:27), they also brought an evil report to the people that caused the whole assembly of the children of Israel to murmur against Moses and Aaron and even to want to appoint a captain and return to Egypt (14:4). Because of their unbelief at Kadesh-barnea, God caused them to turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea (Deut. 1:40). They wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years until the entire generation of the unbelieving men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp (2:1-15).</p>
<p>After this long period of wandering, all the unbelieving ones among the children of Israel were consumed. In many ways God exercised His mercy and blessing to use these thirty-eight years to produce a new generation for the fulfilling of His purpose. This new generation, having been trained and prepared, were to enter into the good land, which God promised to give them as their inheritance. Because the new generation was not present when the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances were given, God gave Moses the burden to rehearse the law (4:44&mdash;26:19). Moses was concerned that they would repeat the failure of their forefathers, and so he spoke many words to them, including a review of their past, a warning, exhortations, and charges (1:1&mdash;4:43; 27:1&mdash;28:68; 31:1-13, 24-29), so that the new generation of the children of Israel would be encouraged to remember God&rsquo;s marvelous grace and mighty works and to obey His statutes and ordinances. By so doing, they would be able to gain the victory, riches, blessings, and inheritance in the promised good land.</p>
<p>As commanded by God, Moses also made a covenant with the children of Israel who were about to enter into the good land (chs. 29&mdash;30). This covenant included prophecies related to the children of Israel. God also commanded Moses to write a song to review the past and to prophesy concerning the future (31:14-23, 30; 32:1-47). Finally, just as Jacob did, Moses blessed the tribes of Israel one by one before his death (ch. 33). There are also many marvelous prophecies in his blessing. In this lesson we will consider the prophecies of importance that are in the covenant enacted by Moses with the children of Israel and that are in his song.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PROPHECIES IN THE COVENANT<br />
ENACTED BY MOSES WITH THE NEW GENERATION<br />
OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>God commanded Moses to make a covenant with the new generation of the children of Israel, besides the one He made with the former generation of the children of Israel at Horeb, that is, at Mount Sinai (29:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Land Being Cursed, and<br />
the Children of Israel Being Plucked Off<br />
from Their Land and Sent to Another Land<br />
If They Forsake the Covenant of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Moses told the children of Israel that when their future generations and the foreigner coming from a distant land saw the plagues of the land and its diseases&mdash;that all the land was sulphur and salt, a burning waste, and that it was not sown, nor did it sprout, nor did any vegetation come up in it&mdash;they would ask, &ldquo;Why has Jehovah done this to this land?&rdquo; (vv. 22-24). The answer would be that because the children of Israel forsook the covenant of Jehovah and went and served other gods, the anger of Jehovah burned against this land, bringing upon it all the curses and that Jehovah plucked them off their land in anger, in burning wrath, and in great indignation and sent them to another land (vv. 25-28).</p>
<p>According to the words of Moses in Deuteronomy 28, if the children of Israel did not listen to the voice of Jehovah their God and were not certain to do all His commandments and His statutes, they would be struck down before their enemies and with diseases, and their possessions would be robbed (vv. 25-35). They would also be cursed by being brought to a nation that they had not heard of, and they would be a source of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples. People would talk about the children of Israel in a despising and mocking way (vv. 36-37). They would be taken into captivity, and they would also be cursed in that their fields and vineyards would be left to locusts, worms, and sojourners (vv. 38-44). These curses would become a sign and a wonder forever to the children of Israel (v. 46). Finally, they would be cursed in being scattered among all the nations and in living a life of captivity, full of terrors (vv. 63-67). They would also be brought back to Egypt, where they would offer themselves for sale to their enemies, but no one would buy them (v. 68).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah God Turning the Captivity of<br />
the Children of Israel If They Return to Him While Living among the Nations</h2>
<p>God also promised that if while among the nations, where Jehovah their God would drive them, the children of Israel and their children would return to Jehovah their God and listen to His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, He would be compassionate to them. Jehovah God would turn, and He would gather them from all the peoples among whom He had scattered them and bring them into the land which their fathers possessed. He would do good for them and multiply them more than He had their fathers (30:1-5). He would circumcise their heart, meaning that He would transform their rebellious nature, and they would then love Him with all their heart and with all their soul (v. 6). He would put all the curses upon their enemies, give them an excess of prosperity in all their undertakings, and exult over them for good (vv. 7-10).</p>
<p>Moses called heaven and earth to witness against the children of Israel because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse (v. 19). He also exhorted them to choose life that they and their seed might live, in loving Jehovah their God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him. He was to be their life and the length of their days so that they might dwell upon the land which He swore to their fathers to give them (vv. 19-20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Result</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel entered into the good land, they forsook Jehovah their God by rebelling against the covenant of God. Although Jehovah, through the prophets, testified against them because of their evil ways, they nevertheless stiffened their necks and rejected His statutes and His covenant, which He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies. They also followed vanity and became vain (2 Kings 17:13-15). As a result, they were cursed, suffered from plagues according to the prophecies in the covenant, were captured to the Gentile world, and were scattered among the nations. They have suffered oppression and persecution for nearly two thousand six hundred years. Israel was restored as a nation in 1948, and many Israelites returned to their land to rebuild the nation. God will renew His blessing on the land and send the early and late rain so that the land changes from desolateness to fertility. God also is preserving the Israelites by overcoming the enemies around them. However, even now, they still have not turned their heart back to God even though He desires their return. They will not fully turn until the Lord Jesus comes again. Then the whole house of Israel will repent and turn to God and be saved (Zech. 12:10-14; Rom 11:26).</p>
<p>The world situation today is advanced with respect to the fulfillment of this prophecy. Before the Lord&rsquo;s return, the Jews will rebuild the temple. Even now they are making preparations for the temple. Soon after they regain the site of the old temple, the temple will be erected. When we see these things taking place, we will know that the summer, which signifies the age of the restoration, is near (Matt. 24:32 and footnotes, Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE PROPHECIES IN THE SONG OF MOSES</h2>
<p>Jehovah charged Moses, &ldquo;Write for yourselves this song and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouth that I may have this song as a witness against the children of Israel&rdquo; (Deut. 31:19). Jehovah knew their intention even before He brought them into the land (v. 21). He knew that after He brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, they would eat and become satisfied and grow fat. They would also turn to other gods and serve them and despise Jehovah and break His covenant (v. 20). Then, when many evils and troubles befell them, this song would respond as a witness before them, and it would not be forgotten in the mouth of their seed (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel<br />
Dealing Corruptly with Jehovah, Forsaking Him,<br />
and Provoking Him to Anger</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 32:1-43 is the contents of the song of Moses. Verses 5 and 6 say that the children of Israel dealt corruptly with Jehovah, having blemishes not like His sons, and repaying Jehovah as foolish and unwise people. The children of Israel were to be God&rsquo;s sons (Exo. 4:22), but in their living they did not behave like God&rsquo;s sons. Instead, they were twisted and crooked. Although God did so much for them, they repaid Him as foolish and unwise people.</p>
<p>The children of Israel grew fat and thick, forsook God who made them, treated the Rock of their salvation disdainfully, and provoked Him to anger with strange gods, with abominations and sacrifices to demons (Deut. 32:15-17). Jehovah saw their actions and held them in contempt because He was provoked to anger by His sons and daughters. He said that He would hide His face from them (vv. 19-20), for a fire was kindled in His anger toward them (v. 22). He would send the teeth of beasts against them with the venom of those that crawled in the dust (v. 24). The sword would bereave outside, and inside would be terror (v. 25). Jehovah would have said that He would scatter them and cause the memory of them to cease from among men, except He dreaded the vexation from the enemy, lest their adversaries misjudged and said that it was their hand that was exalted and that it was not Jehovah who had wrought all this (vv. 26-27). The children of Israel were destitute of counsel, and there was no understanding in them (v. 28). They were not wise and were unable to comprehend that it was Jehovah their Rock who sold them and delivered them up to their enemies (vv. 29-30).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah Vindicating His People and<br />
Having Compassion on His Servants</h2>
<p>Verses 36 through 43 say that when Jehovah saw that the support of His people was gone, He would vindicate them and have compassion on His servants. He would say, &ldquo;Where are their gods...? / Let them rise up and help you; / Let them be a shelter over you. / See now that I, I am He, / And there is no god with Me. / It is I who kill, and I make alive; / I wound, and it is I who heal; / And there is no one who can deliver from My hand&rdquo; (vv. 37-39). He would avenge the blood of His servants, repay His adversaries with vengeance, and cover the guilt of His land and of His people. This indicates that no matter how evil the children of Israel might be and no matter how much God might be provoked in His anger toward them, eventually the result, the issue, would still be good. God does not forsake His people. Eventually, He will come in to vindicate them.</p>
<p>Moses&rsquo; greatest concern was that the children of Israel would turn away from God and go after other gods. This is exactly what the children of Israel have done throughout the centuries. Even today, many of them are still turned away from God to the idols of money, advanced technology, weapons, and skills in fighting. Therefore, on the one hand, God is working to protect the children of Israel. On the other hand, because they have not yet repented and returned to God, He is still judging them.</p>
<p>God does not forsake Israel. On the one hand, God disciplines Israel and deals with her through His sovereign arrangement. On the other hand, God also protects Israel. Because of God&rsquo;s protection, the Arab countries surrounding Israel are unable to destroy this small nation. According to prophecy, Israel will not be destroyed. She will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again as the lightening comes forth from the east and shines to the west (Matt. 24:27). At that time, the whole house of Israel will turn to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>From Horeb to the entry into the good land was an eleven-day journey. However, due to their unbelief, God caused Israel to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years until the entire generation of the unbelieving men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp. God also used these thirty-eight years to produce a new generation, training them and preparing them to enter into the good land. Because Moses was concerned that the new generation would repeat the failure of their forefathers, he made a covenant with them that included prophecies related to the children of Israel. At the same time, God also commanded Moses to write a song to review the past and prophesy concerning the future.</p>
<p>Moses enacted the covenant with the children of Israel and said that if the children of Israel forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the land would be cursed, and they would be plucked off from their land and sent to another land. If the children of Israel were not certain to keep all His commandments and statutes, they would be struck down before their enemies and with diseases, and their possessions would be robbed. They would also be cursed in being brought to a nation that was not known to them and would be a source of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples. Finally, they would be cursed in being scattered among all the nations, and in living a life in captivity. However, God also promised through Moses that if while in captivity the children of Israel would return to Jehovah their God and listen to His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah would be compassionate to them and gather them from all the nations. Moses called heaven and earth to witness against them because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse. He also exhorted them to choose life in loving Jehovah their God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him.</p>
<p>Jehovah also charged Moses to write a song and teach it to the children of Israel and put it in their mouth so that the song would be a witness against the children of Israel, for He already knew their intention even before He brought them into the land. The children of Israel would deal corruptly with Jehovah, forsake Him, and provoke Him to anger. When Jehovah saw that the support of His people was gone, He would vindicate His people, have compassion on His servants, repay His adversaries with vengeance, and cover the guilt of His land and of His people. On the one hand, God disciplines Israel by dealing with her through His sovereign arrangement. On the other hand, God protects Israel from being destroyed until the Lord Jesus comes again. At that time, the whole house of Israel will turn to the Lord.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider Moses&rsquo; prophecy with blessing concerning the tribes of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. MOSES&rsquo; PROPHECY WITH BLESSING<br />
CONCERNING THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 33 speaks of the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death. Many important prophecies are in these blessings. The tribe of Simeon did not receive a blessing from Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Concerning Reuben</h2>
<p>Moses&rsquo; prophecy concerning Reuben in Deuteronomy 33:6 says, &ldquo;May Reuben live and not die, / Nor his men be few.&rdquo; This word implies that Reuben should have died because of his sin (Ezek. 18:20). Even though Reuben should have died, Moses was merciful in executing the judgment of the law. He was concerned that Reuben would die and that the number of his tribe would be greatly decreased.</p>
<p>As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have received the birthright, but he sinned and lost the birthright. Because of his sin, the tribe of Reuben was nearly reduced to nothing. Moses, however, was merciful and prayed that Reuben would live and not die and that his men would not be few. This means that Reuben received the blessing of increase.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Concerning Judah</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 33:7, concerning Judah, Moses said, &ldquo;Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, / And bring him to his people.&rdquo; This was a prayer for Judah, a tribe accustomed to fighting for the people, to be brought back from the battlefield. In verse 7 Moses also said that with his hands Judah contended for his people. Caleb and David are among those who contended in this way. Finally, Moses prayed that Jehovah would help Judah to fight against his adversaries. In fulfillment of this prophecy, Jehovah helped David in defeating the enemies around him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Concerning Levi</h2>
<p>Moses&rsquo; blessing concerning Levi in verses 8 through 11 is very rich.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Receiving Jehovah&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim</h2>
<p>Moses said that Jehovah&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim would be with His faithful men, with whom He contended at the waters of Meribah. Concerning his father and mother, Levi said, &ldquo;I do not regard him,&rdquo; and he did not acknowledge his brothers nor recognize his children. Levi kept Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking and guarded His covenant (vv. 8-9). This indicates that Levi cared for God&rsquo;s interests instead of for his relatives.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Showing Jacob Jehovah&rsquo;s Ordinances<br />
and Israel His Law</h2>
<p>Moses also said that Levi would show Jacob Jehovah&rsquo;s ordinances and Israel His law. Levi would also put incense before Jehovah and whole burnt offerings upon His altar (v. 10). The altar for incense was inside the tabernacle, and the altar for offerings was outside the tabernacle. Levi served God at both altars.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. His Might Being Blessed and<br />
His Work Being Accepted</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Moses asked Jehovah to bless Levi&rsquo;s might and to accept the work of his hands. Moses also prayed that Jehovah would wound thoroughly the loins of those who rose up against him and that those who hated him would not rise up again.</p>
<p>Because Levi&rsquo;s disposition was changed, he became a great blessing. God&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim were with him, and he had the privilege of coming into the presence of God to serve Him. Although the double portion of the land inherited by Joseph is rich, the privilege of entering God&rsquo;s presence enjoyed by Levi is intimate. The priesthood can be considered as the sweet portion of the birthright. Levi received this portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Concerning Benjamin</h2>
<p>In verse 12, concerning Benjamin, Moses said, &ldquo;The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell securely beside Him; / Jehovah shall cover over him all the day, / And He shall dwell between his shoulders.&rdquo; <em>Beside Him</em> indicates that Benjamin would be Jehovah&rsquo;s neighbor. Benjamin would dwell in safety because he would dwell next door to Jehovah. Certainly anyone who dwells beside Jehovah will dwell in safety. This verse also says that Jehovah would cover, overshadow, Benjamin all day long and even dwell between his shoulders. According to geography, the territory of Benjamin has two shoulders toward the south and between these two shoulders is Jerusalem, where the temple, Jehovah&rsquo;s dwelling, was located. Hence, Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, was not located in the territory of Judah but in the territory of Benjamin (Judg. 1:21). Jehovah&rsquo;s dwelling was a cover that overshadowed Benjamin all the day long. In the same way, the Lord will overshadow His people in eternity with His tabernacle (Rev. 7:15). What a blessing!</p>
<p>In the entire Old Testament there is no higher, greater, or sweeter blessing than the blessing of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The psalmists in the Old Testament longed to live in the house of God (Psa. 84:10). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus became flesh and tabernacled among God&rsquo;s people, full of grace and reality (John 1:14). He is the tabernacle and temple of God (2:19, 21). Now the church is being built up to be the temple of God. Finally, the entire New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s eternal tabernacle, overshadowing His people. God will be with His people and will dwell with them. This is the ultimate blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Concerning Joseph</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. His Land Being Blessed by Jehovah</h2>
<p>Moses blessed Joseph and said that his land would be blessed by Jehovah &ldquo;with the choicest things of heaven, with the dew / And with the deep waters that couch beneath; / With the choicest of the crops of the sun, / And with the choicest of the yield of the moons; / With the top of the ancient mountains, / And with the choicest things of the eternal hills; / With the choicest things of the earth, and the fullness thereof, / And the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush&rdquo; (Deut. 33:13-16). The expression <em>Him who dwelt in the thornbush</em> refers to God, who in Exodus 3 appeared to Moses from within a burning thornbush. In Deuteronomy 33:16 Moses continued and asked that all these blessings would &ldquo;come upon the head of Joseph, / And upon the top of the head of him who is separated among his brothers.&rdquo; Joseph was separated from among his brothers and taken to Egypt in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having Majesty, and His Horns<br />
Being the Horns of the Wild Ox</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Like his firstborn ox, he has majesty; / And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; / With them he shall drive peoples / To the ends of the earth together. / Those are the ten thousands of Ephraim; / And those the thousands of Manasseh.&rdquo; Joseph is strong as the firstborn ox. This ox has two horns: one is Ephraim, and the other is Manasseh. With these horns he would drive people to the ends of the earth. This is also a prophecy concerning Christ.</p>
<p>For centuries the inhabitants of cold regions have been trying to spread south to the Mediterranean Sea, including Jerusalem. Eventually, Christ at His coming back as the strong ox will come with two horns and push them back to the northern region. The crucial center of international relations today is the Middle East, and many nations want to spread into that region. But Joseph, the strong ox, will come with the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh to push the peoples back to the ends of the earth, because this land is for God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Concerning Zebulun and Issachar</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Zebulun Rejoicing for His Going Forth and Issachar for His Tents</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;Rejoice, Zebulun, for your going forth.&rdquo; According to this verse Zebulun had to go forth. This going forth was fulfilled in the Lord&rsquo;s sending forth the apostles. Most of the apostles who were sent forth to disciple the nations were produced from Zebulun, which was in the region of Galilee. The Galileans went out with the glad tidings of the victory of Christ, bearing the word of the victorious, restful, and productive Christ. Thus, Zebulun rejoiced in going forth.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years after Jacob uttered the prophetic blessing recorded in Genesis 49, Moses, an old lawgiver, said, &ldquo;Rejoice, Zebulun, for your going forth.&rdquo; The going forth that Moses spoke of refers to the shipping out. The word of Moses corresponds to the word of Jacob. Jacob likened Zebulun to ships, which are for going forth. Zebulun went forth for the preaching of the gospel; hence, he would rejoice. As for Issachar, Moses prophesied that he would rejoice for his tents (Deut. 33:18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Calling Peoples to the Mountain and<br />
Offering Sacrifices of Righteousness to God</h2>
<p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;They shall call peoples to the mountain; / There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness.&rdquo; This verse prophesies that people would be called to the mountain of God, that is, to the kingdom of God. This invitation will be completely fulfilled during the time of the millennial kingdom. In the millennial kingdom all the peoples, the nations, will be called through preaching to God&rsquo;s kingdom in Mount Zion. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness to God.</p>
<p>Today in the church life we experience a miniature of the fulfillment of this prophecy. In God&rsquo;s kingdom, in the church life, righteous offerings are being presented to Him (1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18). All the sacrifices that we offer to God in the church life are of righteousness; that is, they are according to the righteous requirement of God. It will be the same in the coming kingdom, as prophesied in the book of Malachi: &ldquo;He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, and they will offer to Jehovah a sacrifice in righteousness. And the sacrifice of Judah and of Jerusalem will be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old and as in the former years&rdquo; (3:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Sucking the Abundance of the Seas and<br />
the Hidden Treasures of the Sand</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 33:19 Moses also said that Zebulun and Issachar would &ldquo;suck the abundance of the seas / And the hidden treasures of the sand.&rdquo; This word prophesied that when Zebulun and Issachar received their portion of the land by lot, the land that they received would be close to the sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Concerning Gad</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Enlarged by God and Being Strong<br />
in Fighting</h2>
<p>Because the tribe of Gad was rather small, when Moses blessed them prophetically, he said, &ldquo;Blessed be He who enlarges Gad&rdquo; (v. 20). He also said that God would cause this tribe to be strong in fighting, as indicated in the words, &ldquo;He dwells as a lioness, / And tears off the arm, yea, even the top of the head&rdquo; (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Providing the First Part of the Land for Himself</h2>
<p>Furthermore, concerning Gad verse 21 says, &ldquo;He provided the first part for himself, / For there the portion of a lawgiver is reserved.&rdquo; According to the history in the Old Testament, <em>the first part</em> refers to the first part of the inheritance given to the Israelites, that is, the land east of the Jordan. In their journey into the good land, the twelve tribes first entered the land that was on the east side of the Jordan. Desiring this rich, fertile land, Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh begged Moses to give it to them. Although Moses agreed, he charged them not to enjoy their land while their brothers had not yet obtained their portion of the land. Moses charged them to fight the battle for the rest of the good land (Num. 32:1-32), after which the remaining tribes would receive their inheritance. If the two and a half tribes had not gone on to fight for the rest of the land, they would not have been just. Thus, Gad provided the first part of the land for himself, and there a portion was reserved for the lawgiver. This prophecy was fulfilled when Moses, the lawgiver, was buried there (Deut. 32:48-52; 34:1-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Coming with the Heads of the People and Executing the Righteousness of Jehovah<br />
and His Judgments with Israel</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 33:21 also says, &ldquo;He came with the heads of the people; / He executed the righteousness of Jehovah / And His judgments with Israel.&rdquo; Gad went with the heads of the people to take the rest of the good land, to execute the righteousness of Jehovah in dividing the land, and to execute His judgments with Israel (Josh. 22:1-5). Dan&rsquo;s failure was his pride. When he gained more land, he became proud. Instead of caring for his brothers, he set up another center of worship. However, even though Gad gained the land, he pressed on to take care of the need of his brothers, by fighting the battle with his brothers to take the rest of the land so that all his brothers had their inheritance. This is to execute the righteousness of Jehovah and to keep His judgments with Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Concerning Dan</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 33:22 Moses prophesied, &ldquo;Dan is a lion&rsquo;s whelp / That leaps forth from Bashan.&rdquo; As a young lion, Dan was not fighting for the prey but for more land (Josh. 19:47; Judg. 18:27-29). In typology, to fight for more land is to fight for more Christ. The young lion in Judah was for seizing the prey. However, the young lion in Deuteronomy 33:22 is fighting for more land, that is, fighting to gain more Christ. In Judges 18 Dan is a young lion fighting for more land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Concerning Naphtali</h2>
<p>In blessing Naphtali, Moses spoke of this tribe as being satisfied with favor and filled with the blessing of the Lord (Deut. 33:23). Naphtali would possess the sea (the west) and the south. The sea, the west, signifies the Gentile world. The south, the land, signifies the nation of Israel. This means that Naphtali would possess the whole earth, that is, the Gentile and Jewish world. According to Matthew 4:13-16, the Lord Jesus in fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 9:1-2 came to the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, beside the sea. Eventually, through the preaching of the gospel, those of Naphtali possessed the Mediterranean Sea. Church history shows that much has been gained for the Lord in the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Concerning Asher</h2>
<p>According to Moses&rsquo; prophecy, Asher would be blessed above the sons; he would be the one favored of his brothers (Deut. 33:24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Dipping His Foot in Oil</h2>
<p>Verse 24 also says that Asher would be &ldquo;the one dipping his foot in oil.&rdquo; Undoubtedly, the oil here is olive oil. There is an abundance of olive trees in this part of the good land. For this reason, it is rich in oil. The fact that Asher would dip his foot in oil indicates that, as far as food is concerned, he would be richer than all the other tribes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. His Doorbolts Being Iron and Copper</h2>
<p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;Your doorbolts shall be iron and copper.&rdquo; Iron and copper are for fighting the battle and for building. Oil is food for nourishment, but iron and copper are materials for fighting and for building up the kingdom. Since Asher would be rich, favored in food and minerals, he would be more blessed than the other tribes. He would have food for nourishment and minerals for weapons and building materials.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. As His Days Are, So Would His Strength Be</h2>
<p>The second part of verse 25 says, &ldquo;As your days are, so shall your strength be.&rdquo; <em>Strength</em> in this verse relates to safety, security, rest, peace, and quietness. It denotes a leisurely life, a life in which there is sufficiency with no need to worry or rush. Thus, Asher was to have a leisurely life, a life that was safe and secure and in which sufficiency was guaranteed. This means that throughout his life he would not lack anything. He would have rich food for nourishment, weapons for defense, and materials for building. Instead of scarcity, there would be sufficiency, rest, peace, and leisure. Asher would constantly enjoy life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. MOSES&rsquo; FINAL BLESSING<br />
ON ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>After Moses blessed each individual tribe, he blessed all the children of Israel. Moses said that there is no one like the God of Jeshurun (Israel), who rides through the heavens as their help and in His majesty through the skies (v. 26). He also said that the God of old would be their habitation, and underneath would be the eternal arms (v. 27). The children of Israel would dwell in God as their habitation, and His eternal arms would be underneath them. Moreover, God would drive out the enemy before them (v. 27).</p>
<p>Because of the foregoing blessings, Israel would dwell securely, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, on a land of grain and new wine, with the heavens over him dropping their dew (v. 28). Finally, Moses proclaimed, &ldquo;Happy are you, O Israel; who is like you? / A people saved by Jehovah, / The shield of your help / And He who is the sword of your majesty! / So your enemies shall come cringing to you, / And you shall tread upon their high places&rdquo; (v. 29). This was a final blessing on all the children of Israel.</p>
<p>History has proved that Israel is blessed. Although they have often rebelled against God and have even rejected the Lord, God still preserves them and will care for them until the consummation of this age when the whole house of Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:25-27; Isa. 59:20-21; 27:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Before his death, Moses blessed each of the tribes of Israel, just as Jacob did. In Moses&rsquo; blessing there were many wonderful and important prophecies. Only the tribe of Simeon was not included in Moses&rsquo; blessing. Concerning Reuben, Moses was merciful and prayed that Reuben would live and not die and that his men would not be few. According to his sin, Reuben should have died, but Moses blessed him with increase. In blessing Judah Moses said, &ldquo;Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, / And bring him to his people.&rdquo; The blessing of Moses concerning Levi was very rich. Levi would receive Jehovah&rsquo;s Thummim and Urim; they would show Jacob Jehovah&rsquo;s ordinances and Israel His law; their might would be blessed, and their work would be accepted. Moses prophesied that Benjamin would be Jehovah&rsquo;s neighbor and that God&rsquo;s dwelling place would lie between his two shoulders. Thus, Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, was not located in the territory of Judah but in the territory of Benjamin. This is the highest, greatest, sweetest, and ultimate blessing in the entire Old Testament. Moses blessed Joseph by saying that his land would be blessed of Jehovah. As the strong ox, he would come with the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh to push those who would invade Israel back to the ends of the earth, because the land of Israel is for God&rsquo;s people. Moses blessed Zebulun and Issachar, saying that Zebulun would rejoice for his going forth, and Issachar would rejoice for his tents. They would call the peoples to the mountain, and there they would offer sacrifices of righteousness to God. They would suck the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand. Moses said that Gad would be enlarged by God and would be strong in fighting. Gad provided for himself the first part of the land in which the portion of a lawgiver would be reserved. He would come with the heads of the people to execute the righteousness of Jehovah and His judgments with Israel. Moses said Dan would be a lion&rsquo;s whelp leaping forth from Bashan. Naphtali, satisfied with favor and full of the blessing of Jehovah, would possess the sea (the west) and the south; this is to possess the whole earth, including the Jewish and Gentile world. According to Moses&rsquo; prophecy, Asher would be blessed above the sons and would be the one favored of his brothers. He would dip his foot in oil, his doorbolts would be iron and copper, and his strength would be as his days. Finally, Moses blessed all the children of Israel. History has proved that Israel is blessed. Although they often rebel against God, and have even forsaken the Lord, God still preserves them and will care for them until the end of this age when the whole house of Israel will be saved.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider some details in the prophecies of the prophets in the Old Testament concerning the apostate and fallen children of Israel being chastised by God, taken captive, and returning from captivity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>When God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, He brought Abraham into the land of Canaan, the good land, and promised to give him the land (Gen. 12:1, 7). Abraham, therefore, was the first of God&rsquo;s chosen people to enter into the good land. Later, Jacob brought his whole household down to Egypt, where they remained for four hundred thirty years (46:5-6; Exo. 12:40-41). During their time in Egypt, the twelve sons of Israel became a nation with about two million people. However, they were usurped, enslaved, and persecuted by Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Hence, they cried out to God, and God sent Moses to deliver them out of that land of slavery into the good land.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were about to enter into the land of Canaan, God charged them through Moses to slaughter all the Canaanites. He also charged them to destroy all the idols and everything related to idolatry. Joshua received this charge and was faithful to it. Eventually, however, the children of Israel did not slaughter all the Canaanites. Instead, they allowed some to remain. After entering into the good land, they failed God and eventually were divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. The kingdom of Israel became apostate. Its kings forsook God and set up other worship centers in addition to the unique center at Jerusalem. As a result, the kingdom of Israel was captured by the Assyrians. Later, the kingdom of Judah was captured by the Babylonians. The city of Jerusalem was also captured, and the people of God were carried away to heathen lands.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS<br />
AND THEIR PROPHECIES</h2>
<p>During the time of the apostasy and degradation of His people, God raised up many men as vessels who were inspired by the Holy Spirit to represent God and speak to His children. These are the prophets in the Old Testament. Based on the age that they were in, the prophets can be divided into three categories. First, there are the prophets before the captivity&mdash;Jonah who prophesied to the Gentile city Nineveh, Obadiah, Joel, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, Jeremiah, and Habakkuk. The content of the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations extends into the time of captivity. Second, there are the prophets during the captivity&mdash;Daniel and Ezekiel. Third, there are the prophets after the return from captivity&mdash;Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p>
<p>The contents of the books of the prophets are based upon the covenant God made through Moses (Deut. 29&mdash;30), the covenant with David (2 Sam. 7:8-17), Psalm 2, and chapters 2 and 7 of Daniel. These portions contain many significant prophecies. There were definite prophecies in the books of the prophets before the time of captivity concerning Israel&rsquo;s being chastised by God due to their apostasy, their being taken captive to the Gentile nations, and their returning to the Holy Land.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PROPHECY OF JOEL</h2>
<p>Joel was one of the prophets. The time of his ministry was about 800 B.C., probably after the prophet Elisha and during the early reign of King Joash. The book of Joel contains prophecies related mainly to the kingdom of Judah. The scope covered in these prophecies is very broad&mdash;from the time of Joel the prophet to the end of the age. Most of these prophecies have an initial and partial fulfillment as well as a further and complete fulfillment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Plague of the Locusts</h2>
<p>Joel 1:2-3 shows the seriousness of Joel&rsquo;s prophecies. God asked the elders among the people of Israel to hear this message, and He asked all the inhabitants of the land to give heed to it. They were to tell their children about it, their children were to tell their children, and those children were to tell the next generation. The message was that &ldquo;what the cutting locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; / And what the swarming locust has left, the licking locust has eaten; / And what the licking locust has left, the consuming locust has eaten&rdquo; (v. 4). God caused an unprecedented plague of locusts to come to the land of Judah. The suffering of God&rsquo;s children from the plague of locusts was God&rsquo;s chastising them. Both Moses and Solomon had prophesied concerning this (Deut. 28:38; 1 Kings 8:37), but the people of Israel did not pay attention to these prophecies. Therefore, God prophesied once again through Joel the prophet concerning what was about to take place. God had caused a plague of locusts to come upon the land of Egypt because of its transgressions. That story was told among God&rsquo;s people through the generations. Now, because of Israel&rsquo;s transgressions, God caused a plague of locusts to come upon the good land. Hence, He charged the people to recount this story to their children so that they would fear God and keep themselves away from evil matters throughout their generations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Nation Coming Up<br />
against the Land of Jehovah</h2>
<p>The plague of locusts in the book of Joel also indicates that God would cause countless Gentile invaders to swarm into the land of Israel group by group like locusts. In Joel 1:4 four words are used to describe the locust, probably referring to one kind of locust in various stages of growth. The four stages of this one kind of locust refer to the four consecutive empires that devastated Israel: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. These four empires correspond to the four sections of the great human image in Daniel 2:31-33, to the four beasts in Daniel 7:2-8 (cf. Rev. 13:2a), and to the four horns in Zechariah 1:18-21. Throughout the entire human history, these four empires have always been the center in God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel. Joel prophesied that a nation would come up against the land of Jehovah, devour the people, and make the land a desolation (Joel 1:6-7; 2:2-3). The four empires that destroyed the land of Jehovah encompass the period from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of the Babylonian Empire who began to devastate the children of Israel, to the last Caesar (Antichrist) of the Roman Empire (Dan. 8:3-14; 11:2-45; Rev. 13:1-18; 17:11-14; 19:19-21). Until today, this devastating from the nations is still happening to God&rsquo;s chosen people, the nation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Promise of Pouring Out<br />
the Earthly and Spiritual Blessings</h2>
<p>Joel, on one hand, declared and prophesied the judgment of God and, on the other hand, declared that if Israel would turn to Jehovah with all her heart and have a thorough confession, God would send forth His blessings and would bless His land with rich produce, recovering the rains, the early rain and the late rain at the beginning of the season. He would also cause the wine vats and the oil vats to overflow with new wine and fresh oil and would restore to them what the locusts have eaten. Finally, God would remove far from them the great army sent among them, that is, the cutting locust, the swarming locust, the licking locust, and the consuming locust (Joel 2:19-27).</p>
<p>On the spiritual side, Joel prophesied that God would pour out His Spirit upon Israel (vv. 28-29). This prophecy was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 16-21), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste before the great tribulation at the sounding of the fifth trumpet, for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites (Joel 2:30-32; Rev. 8:13&mdash;9:11). At the end of the great tribulation, the Spirit will be poured out again for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews who will be under Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging (Zech. 12:10). These three outpourings of the Spirit work together for God&rsquo;s salvation of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PROPHECY OF AMOS</h2>
<p>The ministry of Amos the prophet was during the end of the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, about 787 B.C. The object of Amos&rsquo;s ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel. Amos was not a prophet originally, nor was he the son of a prophet; rather, he was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamores. Jehovah called him so that He might send him to prophesy to Israel His people (Amos 7:14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Judgment on Judah</h2>
<p>Judah transgressed by rejecting the law of Jehovah and not keeping His statutes, and the lies which their fathers walked after caused them to err (2:4). Therefore, Jehovah sought out their transgressions and punished them, sending fire upon Judah and devouring the palaces of Jerusalem (v. 5). Amos also prophesied concerning the &ldquo;fallen tabernacle of David&rdquo; (9:11). Even when the reign of Uzziah the king of Judah was strong, Amos perceived that the tabernacle of the family of David would fall. Not long after, this word was fulfilled and Judah was taken captive for seventy years.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Judgment on Israel</h2>
<p>Amos said that the children of Israel were not one with God (3:3-8). They practiced violence (vv. 9-12), worshipped idols (vv. 13-15; 4:4-5), oppressed the poor and crushed the needy (vv. 1-3), thrust righteousness down to the ground (5:7), and in their hypocrisy they offered sacrifices to Jehovah as their service (vv. 10-27). Therefore, Amos prophesied that Jehovah would punish them such that their mighty men would flee away naked in that day (2:16) and that during the time of the battle they would fall and be defeated (5:2-3). Amos also exhorted them to return to God and to prepare to meet their God (4:6-13).</p>
<p>The time of Amos&rsquo;s ministry was the golden era of the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, the king of Israel. Jeroboam was the strongest king of Israel. He also reigned for the longest period of time. He reigned for forty-one years and restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of Arabah (2 Kings 14:25). During that time Jehovah God had mercy upon Israel; He &ldquo;saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash&rdquo; (v. 27). However, this golden era in the kingdom of Israel was full of hidden dangers. The sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat had not been removed, the standard of morality was poor, and sins and transgressions increased. These things stirred up the wrath of God. Yet before judging them, God still sent His prophet to the kingdom of Israel to sound out a warning. Sadly, even though Jeroboam the son of Joash was successful in politics and military affairs, he failed in spiritual matters. He worshipped idols, and he did not accept Amos&rsquo;s warning to bring the people back to God. Though not much happened during his reign, fifty years later the judgment of God came, and the kingdom of Israel was destroyed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PROPHECY OF HOSEA</h2>
<p>The time of Hosea&rsquo;s ministry was from approximately 785 B.C., during the reign of Uzziah the king of Judah, to approximately 725 B.C., during the reign of Hezekiah the king of Judah. Hosea spoke mainly to the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Obtaining Compassion and<br />
Not Being the People of God</h2>
<p>Hosea was a prophet during the time when the kingdom of Israel began to decline. The situation in the kingdom was very chaotic. The kings and the people worshipped idols, forsook knowledge, were adulterous and filthy, committed sins, did all kinds of evil, robbed, were abusive, practiced violence and murder, lied, walked in craftiness, mixed with the heathens, and people in high positions betrayed their country for riches (2 Kings 15&mdash;17).Thus, God reached a stage where He could not tolerate their sins any longer.</p>
<p>God told Hosea to take a wife of harlotries. He wanted to show Israel that the prophet&rsquo;s taking a wife of harlotries symbolized the relationship between God and His apostate people. God was the husband, and Israel was the unchaste wife. God had chosen her not because of any good things about her but entirely out of His mercy and compassion. Even after the adulterous woman was married to Hosea, she continued to commit adultery (Hosea 2:2-7), symbolizing that even though Israel was God&rsquo;s elect, they still worshipped idols, served heathen gods, and continued to commit spiritual fornication. God was forced to declare &ldquo;Lo-ruhamah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lo-ammi,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;she has not obtained compassion&rdquo; and &ldquo;not My people&rdquo; (1:6, 9).</p>
<p>After Hosea took Gomer as his wife, she bore a son called Jezreel, then a daughter called Lo-ruhamah, and after that another son called Lo-ammi. These three names are important prophecies. The name Jezreel indicated that in yet a little while Jehovah would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu (v. 4). This judgment was fulfilled when king Zechariah, the great grandchild of Jehu, was killed (2 Kings 15:8-12). Gomer, the wife of Hosea, conceived a second time and bore a daughter whom Jehovah called Lo-ruhamah, meaning &ldquo;she has not obtained compassion.&rdquo; Then Gomer conceived a third time and bore a son whom God called Lo-ammi, meaning &ldquo;not My people&rdquo; (Hosea 1:6, 8-9). The prophecies included in these two names were fulfilled in the fall of the kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Hoshea (2 Kings 17:1-6).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Abiding for Many Days without King,<br />
without Prince, without Sacrifice, without Pillar, and without Ephod and Teraphim</h2>
<p>Hosea was obedient to God. He married Gomer, and she bore him three children. Then she probably left him and committed adultery with her lovers. However, Jehovah told Hosea to love Gomer again as a symbol of His intention to love Israel again by redeeming her, making a covenant with her, and restoring her to Himself (Hosea 3:1-3).</p>
<p>Hosea told Gomer, the woman of adulteries, to abide with him many days without going about as a harlot or being another man&rsquo;s, and he would be the same toward her (v. 3). According to verse 4, this symbolizes that the children of Israel would abide for many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without pillar for worship, and without ephod and teraphim, that is, idols in homes. The &ldquo;many days&rdquo; began when the Babylonians burned the temple. For seventy years the Jews did not offer sacrifices. Then the temple was rebuilt, but it was utterly destroyed by the Roman prince Titus in A.D. 70. Hence, from that time Israel has been without king, without prince, and without their worship of offering sacrifices to God. Furthermore, from that time until the present, a period of nearly two thousand years, the Jews have not worshipped idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH</h2>
<p>Among the Old Testament prophets, Isaiah ministered for the longest period of time, from 760 B.C. through the reign of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He was probably martyred during the reign of Manasseh. Isaiah is called the greatest prophet because his book is the longest in length, the broadest in scope, and the most detailed in the matters concerning the Messiah. The prophecies in the book of Isaiah are mainly concerning Christ&rsquo;s life and work, but the prophecies are also concerning the captivity of God&rsquo;s people and their return.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jerusalem Being Destroyed, and<br />
the Children of God Being Carried Away</h2>
<p>In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah the prophet saw the vision of Jehovah of hosts and heard Him say, &ldquo;Whom shall I send?&rdquo; (Isa. 6:8). Isaiah answered God&rsquo;s calling, and God said to him, &ldquo;Go and say to this people, / Hear indeed, but do not perceive; / And see indeed, but do not understand. / Make the heart of this people numb; / Dull their ears, / And seal their eyes; / Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, / And their heart perceive and return, and they are healed&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). In response to the Lord&rsquo;s charge, Isaiah asked a question. He said, &ldquo;How long, Lord?&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;Until cities lie devastated, / Without inhabitants, / And houses are without people, / And the land is devastated and a waste; / And Jehovah has sent men far away from it, / And desolate places abound in the midst of the land. / But there will still be a tenth part in it; / And it in turn is to be burned&rdquo; (vv. 11-13). This prophetic warning was given in approximately 758 B.C., and it was fulfilled in approximately 606 B.C. by the Babylonian invasion and captivity (2 Kings 24&mdash;25). The Babylonians devastated Jerusalem and carried away the people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Children of Israel Returning from Babylon</h2>
<p>Isaiah 48 is a chapter containing Jehovah&rsquo;s calling Israel to come out of Babylon. Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;Come out from Babylon; / Flee from the Chaldeans; / With a voice of shouting declare; / Let them hear this, / Send it out unto the end of the earth; / Say, Jehovah has redeemed / His servant Jacob. / And they did not thirst / When He led them through the dry places; / He caused water to flow / From the rock for them; / And He split the rock, / And the waters gushed out.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled in Israel&rsquo;s return from captivity.</p>
<p>Verses 14 and 15 say, &ldquo;Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear! / Who among them has declared these things? / Jehovah loves him; he will do His pleasure / On Babylon, and His arm will be upon the Chaldeans. / I, even I, have spoken; indeed, I have called him; / I have brought him, and his way will prosper.&rdquo; <em>Him</em> in these verses refers to Cyrus the king of Persia (44:28; 45:1), who typifies Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. Cyrus did Jehovah&rsquo;s pleasure on Babylon. History says that God used Cyrus, a Gentile king, to subdue Babylon and to release the captives of Israel. This was out of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Cyrus Issuing a Decree<br />
to Rebuild Jerusalem<br />
and Making a Proclamation<br />
to Lay the Foundations of the Temple</h2>
<p>Cyrus the king of Persia was used by God to do many things. Thus, he was God&rsquo;s servant. God needed a man to defeat His enemy Babylon, who had taken His people captive and had destroyed His holy temple. God used Cyrus to subdue Babylon. After obtaining the authority to reign, Cyrus, according to God&rsquo;s will, made a proclamation that fulfilled the end of the seventy years of captivity: Israel was released from captivity. Cyrus also made a decree for the Jews to rebuild the holy temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-3). This was what Isaiah had prophesied, saying, &ldquo;Who says to Cyrus, He is My shepherd, / And he will fulfill all My desire, / Even by saying of Jerusalem, She will be built, / And of the temple, Her foundations will be laid&rdquo; (Isa. 44:28).</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAH</h2>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s ministry began from the thirteenth year of Josiah&rsquo;s reign and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, from about 629 to 588 B.C. During the forty-one years of his ministry, the kingdom of Judah was rapidly declining. The situation outside of the country was that strong neighboring nations, such as Assyria, Egypt, and Babylon, were watching greedily and seeking an opportunity to invade. Within the country all the people, from the king and leaders above to the common people below, forsook God, worshipped idols, and were corrupt in morality. Even though there was a revival during the reign of Josiah, it was only for a brief moment. During the reign of Johoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, the kings of Judah &ldquo;did what was evil in the eyes of Jehovah&rdquo; (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). This was the background during the time of Jeremiah. Under such a circumstance, he spoke forth God&rsquo;s words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel Being in Captivity<br />
for Seventy Years</h2>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecies concerning the kingdom of Judah contain two main points. First, since Israel did not listen to the word of the prophets to turn from their evil way and the evil of their deeds, Jehovah would send Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon in the north, to destroy them and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and an eternal reproach. Jeremiah also prophesied that Israel would serve the king of Babylon for seventy years (Jer. 25:3-11).</p>
<p>Second, after the fulfillment of seventy years, Jehovah would punish the king of Babylon and make Babylon an eternal desolation (vv. 12-14). The seventy years are counted from 606 B.C., when Nebuchadnezzar first took Jerusalem, until 536 B.C., when Cyrus the king of Persia made a decree for the return of the people of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Their Returning after<br />
the Completion of Seventy Years</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel were taken captive for seventy years, God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia and caused him to make a proclamation throughout all his kingdom to encourage the children of Israel to return and build the temple. This fulfilled the prophecy spoken by God through Jeremiah the prophet, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah, When seventy years are fulfilled for Babylon, I will visit you and establish My good word to you, to bring you back to this place&rdquo; (29:10). As a result of the stirring of the hidden God, King Cyrus made a decree, charging the children of Israel who were in captivity to return to Jerusalem and build God&rsquo;s temple (Ezra 1:1-4; 2 Chron. 36:22-23).</p>
<p>According to the record in the Scriptures, there were three returns of the children of Israel from captivity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Leadership of Zerubbabel</h2>
<p>The first return of the children of Israel from captivity was under the leadership of Zerubbabel, a royal descendant of David (Ezra 2:1-2). King Cyrus also brought out the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods, and returned them to Jerusalem (1:7-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Leadership of Ezra</h2>
<p>Later, under the leadership of Ezra, a descendant of the priestly family, the children of Israel had a second return from captivity. In the kingdom of Persia, Ezra was not a ruler with a high position; rather, he was a priest and a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses (7:6). Although he did not have any position in Persia, the king granted him all his request and made a decree concerning those who returned to Jerusalem. Ezra trusted in God and was one with God. He was skilled in the word of God, and he also knew God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s desire, and God&rsquo;s economy. Hence, he had an excellent character and reputation before the king. Ezra was even granted authority from the king to appoint magistrates and judges (v. 25).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Leadership of Nehemiah</h2>
<p>The third return was under the leadership of Nehemiah. Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah was not the counselor of the king or a general in the army. He was only a cupbearer, that is, one who served wine to the king. Yet in his living and conduct he built up a wonderful situation, obtaining the respect of the king. He asked the king to send him to Judah that he might rebuild the city of his fathers&rsquo; graves (Neh. 2:5). Nehemiah asked the king to grant him letters for the governors beyond the River so that they would let him pass through to Judah. He also asked for a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, which belonged to the king, so that he would give him timber (vv. 7-8). The king granted Nehemiah all his requests.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah the children of Israel returned from captivity and were reconstituted to be the testimony of God, the expression of God on earth, and a people absolutely different from the Gentile nations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After entering into the land of Canaan, the children of Israel failed God and were eventually divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. At the time of the apostasy and degradation of His people, God raised up many prophets who prophesied concerning Israel&rsquo;s being chastised by God due to their apostasy, their being taken captive to Gentile nations, and their returning to the Holy Land. Most of these prophecies have an initial and partial fulfillment as well as a further and complete fulfillment. Joel prophesied that God would cause an unprecedented plague of locusts to come to the land of Judah. The plague of locusts also indicated that God would cause countless Gentile invaders to swarm in group by group like locusts. Joel also declared that if Israel would turn to Jehovah with all her heart and have a thorough confession, God would send forth His blessings and would bless His land with rich produce, recovering the rains, the early rain and the late rain, at the beginning of the season. Amos prophesied that God would seek out the transgressions of the people of Judah and would punish them, sending fire upon Judah and devouring the palaces of Jerusalem, and that the tabernacle of David would fall. Amos also judged the children of Israel, prophesying that God would punish them, that their mighty men would flee away naked in that day, and that during the time of battle they would fall and be defeated. Hosea prophesied that the northern kingdom of Israel would not obtain compassion and would not be God&rsquo;s people; they would abide for many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without pillar, and without ephod and teraphim. Isaiah, who ministered for the longest period of time, said that Jerusalem would be destroyed, that God&rsquo;s children would be carried away, that the children of Israel would return from Babylon, and that Cyrus would issue a decree to rebuild Jerusalem and make a proclamation to lay the foundations of the temple. Jeremiah clearly prophesied that the children of Israel would be taken captive and would serve Babylon for seventy years. After the completion of the seventy years, the children of Israel would return to Jerusalem and rebuild God&rsquo;s temple. According to the record in the Scriptures, there were three returns of the children of Israel from captivity. These returns were under the leadership of three leaders: Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Under their leadership, the children of Israel returned from captivity and were reconstituted to be the testimony of God, the expression of God on earth, and a people absolutely different from the Gentile nations.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider the prophecies in Ezekiel concerning the Gentile nations. Although the prophecies in Ezekiel are mainly concerning the house of Israel, this book also contains prophecies concerning God&rsquo;s judgment upon the Gentile nations surrounding Israel. In chapters 25 through 32 Ezekiel prophesied that Jehovah would judge the seven nations surrounding Israel because they worshipped idols and ill-treated God&rsquo;s chosen people Israel. These seven nations include Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, Sidon, and Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ISRAEL BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
AMONG THE HUMAN RACE ON EARTH</h2>
<p>According to Genesis 11, rebellious mankind sought to build the tower and city of Babel in order to concentrate themselves and to make a name for themselves. However, God came down and exercised His judgment over rebellious mankind. Under God&rsquo;s judgment Babel became a center not for gathering but for scattering, and the human race was scattered from Babel as the center. Concerning this, Deuteronomy 32:8 says, &ldquo;When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, / When He divided the sons of man, / He set the borders of the peoples / According to the number of Israel&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; God set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. This indicates that God made Israel the center in His economy on earth among the human race.</p>
<p>The good land, where God put Israel, is the center of the inhabited earth. This land is situated at the center of the three continents&mdash;Europe, Asia, and Africa&mdash;where the human race began. Later, the human population spread to America and also to Australia. The central location of the land of Israel has provided a good opportunity for the spread of the gospel. History shows that the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem and then spread to Europe, Africa, and Asia. Eventually, the preaching of the gospel spread to America and Australia. This was God&rsquo;s purpose in putting His people at the center of the human population. Furthermore, according to the prophecy in Isaiah concerning the coming age, the millennium, the people of Israel will be the priests on this earth, teaching all the nations to worship God (61:6; 2:3). This also shows that Israel is the center of God&rsquo;s economy among the human race on earth.</p>
<p>At the time of Ezekiel the people of Israel were degraded and unsuitable for God&rsquo;s purpose. Their degraded situation forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and temporarily to give up Israel as His center. God turned to Babel and raised up King Nebuchadnezzar, who built the great empire of Babylon. The Babylonian empire then became God&rsquo;s center for executing His judgment. Through the empire of Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed judgment not only upon His people Israel but also over the nations surrounding Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. SEVEN REPRESENTATIVE NATIONS</h2>
<p>Chapters 25 through 32 of Ezekiel speak of seven nations that surrounded the nation of Israel. Actually, there were more nations around Israel, but this record concerns only seven. This is similar to the references to the seven churches in Asia in Revelation 1 through 3. When the Lord spoke of the churches in Asia, He selected only seven churches (1:11). This does not mean that there were only seven churches in Asia but that the Lord selected seven churches to represent all the churches. The principle is the same in Ezekiel. There were more than seven nations surrounding Israel, but God selected seven nations to represent all the nations when He spoke of the judgment that He was about to execute.</p>
<p>These seven nations are divided into three groups. The first four nations&mdash;Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia&mdash;form the first group; Tyre and Sidon make up the second group; and Egypt stands alone. These nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning them. His first vision covers the first four nations; his second vision, Tyre and Sidon; and his third vision, Egypt. In these visions Ammon and Moab are a pair, Edom and Philistia are a pair, and Tyre and Sidon are a pair. Only Egypt stands alone.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CONDITION OF THE NATIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Ammon and Moab</h2>
<p>Ammon and Moab were brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters. Their origin was ugly and evil. Yet Lot was a relative of Abraham, the first forefather of the people of Israel. Hence, by blood Ammon and Moab were somewhat close to Israel. Although Ammon and Moab were brothers, what they each did toward Israel was very different.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Ammon</h2>
<p>According to the record in Ezekiel, the Ammonites offended God (25:2-3). When the sanctuary of God was desecrated, they were happy. When the Holy Land of God was made desolate, they were happy. When the house of Judah was carried away into exile, they were also happy. The Ammonites were happy about three things: the sanctuary being desecrated, the land of Israel being desolated, and the house of Judah being carried away into exile. This indicates that they hated the sanctuary, the Holy Land, and the house of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Moab</h2>
<p>The Moabites said, &ldquo;Look, the house of Judah is just like all the other nations!&rdquo; (v. 8). The Moabites were happy to see that Jerusalem was no longer separated, different, from the nations. The Moabites signify persons who like to bring God&rsquo;s people into an association with the world and who like to make God&rsquo;s people the same as the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Edom and Philistia</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Edom</h2>
<p>Like Ammon and Moab, Edom was closely related to Israel. Edom was the son of Esau, the brother of Jacob. Therefore, according to blood Edom and the sons of Israel were cousins. However, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel and was continually seeking vengeance (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Philistia</h2>
<p>Philistia and Edom were in the second pair. According to Judges and 1 Samuel, the Philistines were even closer to the Israelites than the Edomites. The Philistines lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites. A number of times the Philistines came to the people of Israel and intervened in their worship to God. Once, the Ark was captured by the Philistines and was kept by them for a period of time (1 Sam. 5:1; 6:1). Therefore, when referring to the Philistines, Ezekiel said that they acted in vengeance against the people of Judah and were full of vengeance to destroy them with a perpetual enmity (Ezek. 25:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Tyre and Sidon</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Tyre</h2>
<p>The people of Tyre were occupied with business dealings, silver and gold, and enjoyment. They cared only for pleasure. According to Ezekiel, the people of Tyre declared that Jerusalem would fall and that they were happy about it. Furthermore, they were also proud. The king of Tyre exalted himself to such an extent that he even made himself a god. Hence, the Bible considers the king of Tyre as a figure of Satan (26:1-6; 28:1-19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Sidon</h2>
<p>Sidon forms a pair with Tyre. Ezekiel said that Sidon was a pricking briar or a painful thorn to the house of Israel (v. 24). Sidon signifies people who damage the life of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Egypt</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, Egypt is a nation that depends on its own resources, not on God. Egypt has the Nile River as the resource of its riches. The Egyptians did not depend on the rains from heaven but on the water from the Nile. In addition, they exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have an abundant supply. Whenever the children of Israel were short of food, they went down to Egypt for the supply. Hence, Egypt represents persons who exercise their natural wisdom and develop their natural resources in order to be rich and have a supply. At the time of Ezekiel, Israel turned to Egypt and leaned on Egypt, trusting in Egypt as their staff. However, God said that Egypt was a staff made of reeds that broke easily (29:2-9).</p>
<p>When Ezekiel speaks about Tyre and Egypt, he also speaks of &ldquo;Eden, the garden of God&rdquo; (28:13; 31:9, 16). With their riches and resources, Tyre and Egypt made their contemporary world a garden of Eden. This was not the garden of Eden made by God; it was a garden of Eden made by those who cared only for their rich enjoyment on earth, not for God. However, God said that He would send Egypt, with its garden of Eden, to Hades, to the pit, to the depths of the earth. This reveals that God will judge the people who care only for earthly happiness and enjoyment but do not need God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>God came to execute judgment and destroy the nations (25:7, 16; 28:16; 30:10), by making them desolate (25:13; 26:19; 29:9-12; 30:7), bringing them very low (29:14; 30:6), consuming them (28:18; 30:8), and delivering them to the lower parts of the earth, to the pit (26:20; 31:14, 16-18; 32:18-30). Eventually, all those who hate God&rsquo;s people will be in the lower parts of the earth. This is the place where every persecutor of God&rsquo;s people will eventually go.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT OF GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT<br />
UPON THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>The first result of God&rsquo;s judgment upon the nations was that all the nations, as well as Israel, would come to know that He is the Lord Jehovah. &ldquo;That they may know that I am Jehovah&rdquo; (25:7, 11, 17; 26:6; 29:6). This expression is used many times in Ezekiel Again and again the Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I will destroy them that they may know that I am Jehovah. I will make them low that they may know that I am Jehovah. I will put them into the lower parts of the earth that they may know that I am Jehovah.&rdquo; The second result of God&rsquo;s judgment upon the nations was that His purpose was carried out and fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When God scattered mankind, He set up the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel in order to make Israel the center of the inhabited earth. However, at the time of Ezekiel, the children of Israel became degraded and unsuitable for God&rsquo;s purpose. God therefore exercised judgment upon them and temporarily gave up Israel as His center. He raised up Nebuchadnezzar and executed judgment upon His people Israel and the seven representative nations surrounding Israel through the empire of Babylon.</p>
<p>Ammon and Moab were brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters. Their origin was ugly and evil. The Ammonites offended God because they were happy when the sanctuary of God was desecrated, the Holy Land was made desolate, and the house of Judah was carried away into exile. The Moabites were happy that Jerusalem was no longer separated from the nations. Edom was very close to Israel but was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking vengeance. The Philistines were even closer to the Israelites than the Edomites. They lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites. A number of times the Philistines intervened in the Israelites&rsquo; worship to God and once even captured the Ark. The people of Tyre were occupied with business dealings, silver and gold, and enjoyment. They declared that Jerusalem would fall. The king of Tyre exalted himself to such an extent that he even made himself a god. Sidon was a pricking briar or a painful thorn to the house of Israel, and they damaged the life of God&rsquo;s people. Egypt was a nation that depended on its own resources, not on God. Like Tyre, Egypt made use of its riches and resources to become a garden of Eden. The Egyptians cared only for earthly happiness and enjoyment and did not need God. Therefore, Ezekiel prophesied that God would execute judgment upon these nations and destroy them by making them desolate, bringing them low, and delivering them to the lower parts of the earth. God&rsquo;s judgment upon the nations was for the nations, as well as Israel, to know that He is Jehovah and for His purpose to be carried out and fulfilled.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider the prophecies concerning human government in Daniel. Daniel is a special book because more than half of its prophecies concern the Gentiles, unlike the other books of the prophets that are mainly concerning the children of Israel. Although the other prophets also spoke concerning the Gentiles, the scope of their prophecies is not as extensive as that of Daniel&rsquo;s, which is concerning the four great empires of the world and the nations that were to rise up afterward, beginning from the time that Babylon first invaded Judah to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming to establish His kingdom. This period of time is what the Lord referred to as &ldquo;the times of the Gentiles&rdquo; (Luke 21:24). Through Daniel we can fully understand how the history of human government under the Gentiles is closely related to God&rsquo;s economy and the history of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE MAJOR PROPHECIES IN DANIEL</h2>
<p>Four chapters in Daniel specifically prophesy concerning human government. Chapter 2 is about Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. Chapter 7 concerns the vision of the four beasts out of the Mediterranean Sea. Chapter 8 is about the conflict between the ram and the male goat, and chapter 11 is about the king of the south and the king of the north.</p>
<p>The great image in chapter 2 has four parts. The first part is the head, the second is the breast and the arms, the third is the abdomen and thighs, and the fourth is the legs and feet, including the ten toes. The period of history signified by the first three parts and the two legs has already been fulfilled. However, the period of time signified by the ten toes is yet to be fulfilled. The four beasts in chapter 7 correspond to the four parts of the great image in chapter 2. The first beast corresponds to the head of the image, the second beast corresponds to the breast and the arms of the image, the third beast corresponds to the abdomen and thighs of the image, and the fourth beast corresponds to the legs, including the toes of the image. According to the vision in chapter 7, the fourth beast will eventually bring forth ten horns. These ten horns correspond to the ten toes in the fourth part of the great image. The ram and the male goat in chapter 8 correspond to the second and the third beasts in chapter 7. Therefore, the male goat corresponds to the third beast and to the third part of the great image. The male goat in chapter 8 eventually has four horns, and out from one of the horns comes forth a little horn. Chapter 11 is concerning two kings: the king of the south and the king of the north. The king of the north, who corresponds to the little horn of the male goat in chapter 8, is a shadow of Antichrist.</p>
<p>We need to pay attention to the relationship between these four chapters in Daniel. The four beasts in chapter 7 correspond to the four parts of the great image in chapter 2. The ram and the male goat in chapter 8 correspond to the second and the third beasts in chapter 7. The king of the north in chapter 11 comes out of one of the four horns of the male goat. Eventually, the king of the north is the little horn in chapter 8.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PROPHECY<br />
CONCERNING HUMAN GOVERNMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Vision<br />
concerning Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Dream</h2>
<p>In Daniel 2 Nebuchadnezzar had a marvelous dream of a great human image (v. 1). That dream should have impressed him deeply, but he forgot the dream because he did not have a heart for God&rsquo;s interest. He wanted to know the dream, but all the magicians, all the wise men of Babylon, and the Chaldeans were unable to tell him the dream (vv. 2-13). However, among the captured Israelites there was a man, Daniel, who set his heart on God&rsquo;s interest on earth. He did not know the dream, but he received a vision from God concerning it, and he interpreted it (vv. 17-45).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Contents of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Dream</h2>
<p>The great human image in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream signifies the totality of human government throughout human history, from the beginning of human government in Babel (Babylon) (Gen. 10:6-12), as signified by the head, to the termination of human government in the Roman Empire with the ten kings, as signified by the ten toes.</p>
<p>The head of gold in the great human image corresponds to the first beast in Daniel 7:4 and signifies Nebuchadnezzar, the founder and the king of Babylon (2:36-38). The breast and the arms of silver correspond to the second beast in 7:5 and signify Medo-Persia (2:39). The abdomen and thighs of bronze correspond to the third beast in 7:6 and signify Greece, including Macedonia (2:39). The two legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay correspond to the fourth beast in 7:7-8 and signify the Roman Empire with its last ten kings (2:40-43). The territories of the western Roman Empire included Gaul, Spain, Britain, Italy, and the western part of North Africa. The territories of the eastern Roman Empire included Macedonia, Greece, Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, Judea, Egypt, and the eastern part of North Africa. The Roman Empire was suspended after A.D. 476. During this time of suspension, that is, during the time after the two legs and before the ten toes, the Roman Empire has been replaced by the Roman Catholic Church. Eventually, the Roman Empire will be revived and will consummate as ten nations, signified by the ten toes.</p>
<p>According to the human image in Daniel 2, there are only four empires. In the sight of God, all human government throughout human history is composed of four empires: the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. According to the human point of view, the Grecian Empire ended with the death of Alexander the Great. However, according to God&rsquo;s viewpoint, the Grecian Empire continued with Alexander&rsquo;s successors&mdash;his four generals who divided the empire into four sections&mdash;and it lasted until the beginning of the Roman Empire. Apparently, the Roman Empire has been terminated. Actually, the Roman Empire continues to exist. According to Daniel and Revelation, Antichrist will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, which will have ten kings as signified by the ten toes of the great image. The Roman Empire under Caesar Augustus began approximately thirty years before the birth of Christ and will last until the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The great human image, which is the aggregate of human government, began with Nimrod at Babel and will consummate with the last Caesar of the Roman Empire with his ten kings.</p>
<p>The culture of the world is an accumulation of culture from the time of Nimrod until the present. The Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Macedonian-Grecian Empires have ended, but their culture remains. The Medo-Persian Empire adopted aspects of Babylonian culture, and the Macedonian-Grecian Empire adopted aspects of Medo-Persian culture. In the same principle, the Roman Empire adopted many elements of Greek culture and of the cultures that preceded it. We are still under the influence of Roman culture, especially in the matters of law, politics, and government. In this sense, the Roman Empire continues to exist, and we are still in this empire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Destiny of the Great Human Image</h2>
<p>Daniel 2:34-35 and 44 through 45 prophesy that the destiny of the great human image is to be crushed by a stone cut out without hands. This stone cut out without hands is Christ.</p>
<p>As the stone that will crush the entire human government of mankind, Christ was not cut out with human hands, as indicated by the words <em>without hands</em> in verses 34 and 45. He was cut by God through His crucifixion and resurrection. Through His crucifixion He was cut by being put to death (Acts 2:23). In His resurrection He was cut out to be the cornerstone for the building up of the church and the crushing stone to destroy the totality of human government (Matt. 21:42, 44).</p>
<p>At His appearing as the stone cut out without hands, Christ will crush the great human image from the toes to the head. Daniel 2:34-35 says, &ldquo;A stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found.&rdquo; This is a prophecy that eventually all human government, from Nimrod to Antichrist, will be terminated by Christ at His appearing as the God-cut stone. Revelation 19 speaks of the war between Antichrist and Christ when He appears at the end of this age. Christ will come with His bride, composed of the overcomers, and Antichrist will be with the ten kings and their armies. Christ will defeat and destroy Antichrist and the ten kings.</p>
<p>Daniel 2:35 says, &ldquo;The stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; The great human image will be replaced with a great mountain, which signifies the eternal kingdom of God that will fill the whole earth (v. 44). When Christ comes to crush the totality of human government, He will usher in the eternal kingdom of God on earth (Rev. 11:15).</p><h2 class="head3">3. God&rsquo;s People Needing a Proper View</h2>
<p>All God&rsquo;s people need to see the controlling vision in the second chapter of Daniel and, in the light of this vision, have a clear view regarding human government. In the eyes of human beings, there are different kinds of governments; some are good, and others are bad. However, according to Daniel 2 and 7, in the eyes of God every human government is a beast. Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire are beasts. We need to see such a vision. If God&rsquo;s people see this controlling vision, they will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Vision<br />
concerning the Four Beasts out of<br />
the Mediterranean Sea</h2>
<p>In Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream human government on the earth was signified by a great human image full of glory and splendor. In chapter 7, however, it was unveiled to God&rsquo;s prophet, Daniel, that the heads of human government on the earth, and the governments themselves, are signified by four great, fierce, cruel, and inhuman beasts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The First Beast</h2>
<p>The first beast (v. 4) corresponds to the head of gold of the great human image in 2:36 through 38 and signifies Babylon with its founder and king, Nebuchadnezzar. The beast was like a lion&mdash;the king of the beasts, the most fierce and cruel beast. It had the wings of an eagle. The eagle is the king of the fowls. The eagle wings signify that the beast was in the air, which belongs to Satan, the ruler of the air, and that its move was swift.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Second Beast</h2>
<p>The second beast (7:5) corresponds to the breast and arms of silver of the great human image in 2:32 and 39 and signifies Medo-Persia. This beast resembled a bear. This signifies that it was not as strong and swift as the lion but that it was still fierce and cruel. It raised up its body on one side, signifying that Media and Persia became one dominion. Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. This signifies that three kingdoms, Babylon, Assyria, and Egypt, were devoured by it. The second beast was commanded to arise and devour much flesh. This signifies that it would devour more nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Third Beast</h2>
<p>The third beast (7:6) corresponds to the abdomen and thighs of bronze of the great human image in 2:32 and 39 and signifies Greece with its king, Alexander the Great. The third beast was like a leopard. This indicates that it was fierce, cruel, and swift. It had four wings of a bird on its back. This signifies that by means of his four generals, Alexander the Great was as swift as a bird with four wings. This beast had four heads, signifying that the four wings for swiftness became four heads, four generals who became the heads of four kingdoms. After the death of Alexander the Great, his four generals divided his empire into four kingdoms. The third beast was given dominion, signifying that it was given authority to rule over the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Fourth Beast</h2>
<p>The fourth beast (7:7-8) is the beast revealed in Revelation 13:1-2. This beast corresponds to the legs of iron and the feet, partly of iron and partly of clay, of the great human image in Daniel 2:40-43, signifying the Roman Empire. As signified by iron, the fourth beast was dreadful and frightful and exceedingly strong. It had large iron teeth and claws of bronze, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled under the remainder (7:19). This signifies that it had great power to devour and crush nations and trampled down the nations that remained. This beast had ten horns. A small horn came up among the ten horns, and three of them were uprooted from before it (vv. 8, 24). This signifies that a king will come up among the ten kings, and he will subdue three of the kings. This is a prophecy concerning the rising up of Antichrist.</p>
<p>Daniel said that this horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things (vv. 8, 20, 25). This signifies that Antichrist will have sharp insight to perceive things and a mouth to speak great things against God (Rev. 13:5-6). Daniel prophesied that Antichrist will be slain and that his body will be destroyed and given to the burning fire (Dan. 7:11; Rev. 19:20). Antichrist will wage war with the saints. He will wear out the saints of the Most High for three and a half years and prevail against them (Dan. 7:21, 25; Rev. 13:7). His intention will even be to change the times and the law (Dan. 7:25). But he will be judged by God, and his dominion will be taken away, &ldquo;so as to annihilate and destroy it unto the end&rdquo; (v. 26). According to 7:22 and 27 the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under heaven will eventually be given to the saints of the Most High.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Concerning the Rest of the Beasts</h2>
<p>As for the first three beasts in Daniel 7, their dominion, that is, their authority and kingdom, was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and for a time (v. 12). This indicates that although the dominion and authority of Babylon, Persia, and Greece were taken away, their culture will be extended and remain. Today the culture in the human world is still the Western culture, the Roman culture. Western culture is the consummation of Roman, Greek, Persian, and Babylonian culture.</p>
<p>Belshazzar, the Babylonian king, was defeated by Darius the Mede. Then Alexander the Great defeated Darius the Persian, a different Darius, in 330 B.C. Alexander the Great was succeeded by his four generals who ruled over four kingdoms. In 27 B.C. Caesar Augustus became the emperor of the Roman Empire and replaced the Grecian Empire. Although the Roman Empire came to an end around A.D. 476, the Roman spirit, culture, law, politics, and customs continue to exist. Therefore, in a sense, the world today is still a part of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Daniel clearly unveils God&rsquo;s economy. According to His economy, God is ruling over the world in order to produce a situation for Israel to be His elect, to gain the church to be His mysterious people, and to have all the nations to be the peoples in the eternal kingdom of God. If we see this, we will know where we are, and we will know the meaning of our human life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Vision<br />
concerning a Ram and a Male Goat<br />
with its Successors</h2>
<p>The vision in 8:3-14 concerns a ram and a male goat with its successors.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. A Ram</h2>
<p>The ram signifies Medo-Persia (vv. 3, 20; 11:2). This ram was standing before the river Ulai (8:2-3), signifying that the Medo-Persian Empire became strong by the river Ulai. The ram had two horns, which &ldquo;were high, but one was higher than the other; and the higher one came up last&rdquo; (v. 3). These two horns signify Media and Persia. Persia with its king Cyrus (Ezra 1:1) became higher than Media. Daniel saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward (Dan. 8:4). This signifies that Medo-Persia conquered Babylon in the west, Assyria in the north, and Egypt in the south. Verse 4 also says, &ldquo;No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could deliver from his power.&rdquo; This signifies Medo-Persia&rsquo;s subduing power. Furthermore, verse 4 continues, &ldquo;He did as he pleased, and he became great.&rdquo; This indicates that Medo-Persia had no fear of God and became arrogant in itself. Eventually, God dealt with Medo-Persia by raising up Alexander the Great.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. A Male Goat</h2>
<p>The male goat signifies Greece with Alexander the Great (vv. 5, 21; 11:2-3). This male goat came from the west (8:5), signifying that Alexander the Great came from Europe. The goat came over the face of the whole earth without touching the ground (v. 5). This signifies the swift movement of Alexander the Great over the earth. Daniel saw that the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes (v. 5). This signifies Alexander the Great as an extraordinary horn who was very intelligent. The goat came up to the ram in his mighty wrath, struck the ram, broke his two horns, threw him to the ground, and trampled him. The ram had no strength to withstand him, and there was none to deliver the ram from his power (vv. 6-7). This indicates that Alexander the Great conquered Medo-Persia and destroyed it. The male goat became very great, but once he became strong, the great horn was broken (v. 8). This indicates that Alexander the Great became arrogant in himself. Furthermore, once the great horn of Greece, Alexander the Great, became strong in power, he died.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Successors of the Male Goat</h2>
<p>The second half of verse 8 through verse 14 speaks of the successors of the male goat.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Place of the Great Horn, Four Conspicuous Ones<br />
Coming Up toward the Four Winds of Heaven</h2>
<p>Daniel said that in the place of the great horn, four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven (v. 8; 11:4). After Alexander the Great, his four generals who correspond to the four wings and the four heads in 7:6&mdash;Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus&mdash;rose up from the four ends of the Grecian Empire to form nations in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Syria respectively. According to the human point of view, the Grecian Empire ended with the death of Alexander the Great. But in the sight of God the Grecian Empire continued to exist in the four empires formed by Alexander the Great&rsquo;s four generals. One of the four empires was Egypt in the south, and another was Syria in the north. Daniel 11 describes the warfare between these two empires in the territory of Israel.</p><h2 class="head4">b. A Little Horn Coming Forth<br />
out of One of the Four Horns</h2>
<p>Out of one of the four horns came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful (8:9). This little horn signifies Antiochus IV Epiphanes from Syria in 175-164 B.C. He expanded very much toward Egypt in the south, toward Syria in the east, and toward Israel. The expression <em>that which is beautiful</em> refers to the beautiful land of Israel.</p>
<p>The little horn &ldquo;grew great, as high as the host of heaven; and it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them&rdquo; (v. 10; cf. 11:30). Antiochus Epiphanes became great in power and persecuted the saints, signified by the host of heaven and the stars (12:3). In all these evil things he typifies the coming Antichrist (Rev. 13:5-7; 2 Thes. 2:3-4). Antiochus Epiphanes thought he was as high as God, the Prince of the host; he stopped the daily sacrifice to God and defiled the temple with pigs and fornication (Dan. 8:11; 11:31). Furthermore, he cast truth down to the ground, and he prospered (8:12).</p>
<p>Verse 23 speaks of Antiochus Epiphanes as the king who arose, of fierce countenance and skilled in ambiguities. His power was mighty, but it was not by his own power. He destroyed in an extraordinary manner, destroying mighty men and the holy people (v. 24). Through his craftiness he also caused deceit to prosper in his hand. He magnified himself in his heart, he destroyed many who were complacently secure, and he stood up against the Prince of princes (God), but eventually he was broken, yet not by human hands (v. 25). In all these items Antiochus Epiphanes also typifies Antichrist (Rev. 13:6; 17:11; 19:20).</p>
<p>Antiochus Epiphanes was given two thousand three hundred days to do evil things in the Holy Land, from about 171 B.C. until December 25, 165 B.C. That was the day when the Jewish hero Judas Maccabeus cleansed the sanctuary after defeating Antiochus Epiphanes (Dan. 8:13-14, 26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Vision<br />
concerning the King of the South<br />
and the King of the North</h2>
<p>The vision in Daniel 11 is related to the king of the south, Egypt, and the king of the north, Syria. Daniel prophesied concerning the fighting between these two kings in the territory of Israel. This fighting caused God&rsquo;s chosen people to be in distress.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Fighting of the Last King<br />
of the Kingdom of Persia<br />
against the Kingdom of Greece</h2>
<p>Verses 2 and 3 speak of the defeat of Persia by the mighty king of Greece, Alexander the Great, from about 356-323 B.C. (cf. 8:5-8, 20-21; 7:5-6). The death of Belshazzar in 538 B.C. marked the end of the Babylonian Empire and the beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire, which lasted until 336 B.C. The last king of the Medo-Persian Empire was defeated by Alexander the Great.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Kingdom of Greece<br />
Being Divided into Four Kingdoms<br />
under Alexander the Great&rsquo;s Four Generals</h2>
<p>Referring to Alexander the Great, Daniel 11:4 says, &ldquo;Once he arises, his kingdom will be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up and given to others besides his descendants.&rdquo; After the death of Alexander the Great, his kingdom was divided into four kingdoms&mdash;Egypt, Macedonia, Asia Minor, and Syria&mdash;under the rule of his four generals (8:8, 22; 7:6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Wars Back and Forth<br />
between the King of the South<br />
and the King of the North</h2>
<p>Between the king of the south (Egypt) and the king of the north (Syria), there were wars back and forth (11:5-20). As these kings fought each other, they passed through Israel. Thus, Israel was in great distress as a result of the wars (vv. 10, 16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Kingdom and<br />
the Evils of Antiochus Epiphanes<br />
as One of the Kings of the North</h2>
<p>Daniel 11:21-45 and 8:23-25 describe in detail the kingdom and the evils of Antiochus Epiphanes as one of the kings of the north. He was a despicable person. He came in a time of security and seized the kingdom by smooth and cunning words and actions (11:21). After he defeated the king of the south, his heart was set against the holy covenant, and he took action. He sent armies to profane the sanctuary, remove the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination that desolates. Although he persecuted and slew the devoted Jews (vv. 33-35), Daniel said, &ldquo;The people who know their God will show strength and take action&rdquo; (v. 32). This refers to Judas Maccabeus and the children of Israel who followed him. They were encouraged and strengthened by this prophecy in Daniel to take action against Antiochus Epiphanes and his armies.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SEEING THAT THE WORLD SITUATION<br />
IS UNDER THE RULE OF THE HEAVENS<br />
BY THE GOD OF THE HEAVENS<br />
TO MATCH HIS ECONOMY FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The prophecy concerning human government in Daniel shows that the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens (2:37, 44) over all human government on earth matches God&rsquo;s eternal economy for Christ to terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and to smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Human government began in Genesis 10 with Nimrod, who built Babel, a prefigure of Babylon (vv. 8-10). Human government will conclude with the coming Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire. All human government from Nimrod to Antichrist has been and will continue to be under the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy Christ terminated the old creation for the germination of the new creation in His resurrection through His death. This was achieved in His first coming. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ, in His second coming, will also smash and crush the aggregate of human government and will establish the eternal kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The entire world situation is under the rule of the heavens by the God of the heavens in order to match His economy for Christ. The world situation has been brought into a condition that is ready for Christ&rsquo;s return. He is at the door; the time is near. This situation should cause us to wake up and realize that the world is not for us. We are for Christ, and every day we must prepare ourselves to meet Him. Then we will receive a reward from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Daniel is a special book in that more than half of its prophecies concern the Gentiles. Through this book, we can fully understand how the history of human government under the Gentiles is closely related to God&rsquo;s economy and the history of God&rsquo;s people. Daniel 2 concerns the dream of Nebuchadnezzar. Chapter 7 concerns the vision about the four beasts out of the Mediterranean Sea. Chapter 8 concerns the conflict between the ram and the male goat. Chapter 11 concerns the king of the south and the king of the north. The great human image in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream signifies the aggregate of human government throughout human history. The head of gold signifies Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar; the breast and the arms of silver signify Medo-Persia; the abdomen and thighs of bronze signify Greece, including Macedonia; and the legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay signify the Roman Empire with its last ten kings. This great human image will be crushed by a stone cut out without hands. The stone that strikes the image will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth. Daniel also saw four beasts. These four beasts correspond to the four parts of the great image. Daniel also saw the vision of a ram and a male goat with its successors. The ram signifies Medo-Persia, and the male goat signifies Greece and Alexander the Great. The male goat broke the two horns of the ram, threw him to the ground, and trampled him. However, once the male goat became strong, the great horn was broken. In the place of the great horn, four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven. Out of one of the four horns came forth a little horn. This little horn signifies Antiochus Epiphanes from Syria, and also refers to the coming Antichrist. Antiochus Epiphanes grew great and high as the host of heaven, he caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and he trampled them. Eventually, however, he was broken, yet not by human hands. The prophecies in Daniel concerning human government show that the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens over all human government on earth matches God&rsquo;s eternal economy for Christ to terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and to smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Verses 24 through 27 of chapter 9 are the most precious portion in the book of Daniel. The seventy weeks in these verses are the key to understanding all the prophecies in the Bible. Daniel&rsquo;s vision was in the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, who was king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans in about 538 B.C. (v. 1). When Daniel &ldquo;understood by means of the Scriptures the number of the years, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, that is, seventy years&rdquo; (v. 2), he prayed and confessed his own sins and the sins of the kings, the chief men, and the fathers of Israel, and of all the people of Israel (vv. 3-15, 20). In his prayer Daniel also supplicated for the city of God&mdash;Jerusalem, the holy mountain of God&mdash;and the people of God (vv. 16-17, 19, 20b).</p>
<p>In his desperate prayer Daniel requested that God recover the Holy Land, send His people back, and rebuild the holy city (vv. 15-19). God answered him by giving him a vision through the angel Gabriel of the seventy weeks (vv. 20-27). This answer exceeded Daniel&rsquo;s request.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PURPOSE OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS</h2>
<p>The purpose of the seventy weeks is &ldquo;to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make propitiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies&rdquo; (v. 24). Under human government in the old creation, transgression, sins, and iniquity prevail. When Christ comes at the time appointed to crush human government, transgression will be closed, sins will be ended, and iniquity will be propitiated. Then the righteousness of the ages, the eternal righteousness, will be brought in. The coming kingdom age will be an age of divine righteousness, and in the new heaven and new earth righteousness will dwell (2 Pet. 3:13).</p>
<p>Daniel 9:24 also speaks of the second purpose of the seventy weeks&mdash;the sealing up of vision and prophet. After the seventy weeks everything will be accomplished and fulfilled. There will therefore be no need of visions or prophets. In the kingdom age there will be kings and priests but no prophets.</p>
<p>The last aspect of the purpose of the seventy weeks is to anoint the Holy of Holies. At the time of Daniel&rsquo;s prayer, the Holy of Holies was contaminated, defiled, and devastated. But when the apportioned time comes, the Holy of Holies will be properly anointed. This means that the service to God will be recovered. What a prophecy!</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECTIONS OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS</h2>
<p>Daniel 9:24-27 gives the sections of the seventy weeks. Verse 24 says, &ldquo;Seventy weeks are apportioned for your people and for your holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make propitiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.&rdquo; <em>Your people</em> refers to the children of Israel, and <em>your holy city</em> refers to Jerusalem. According to biblical interpretation, in verses 24 through 27 one week does not refer to seven days but to seven years. If the seventy weeks were to refer to seventy times seven days, there would not be an appropriate explanation for this portion of the Word.</p>
<p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;Know therefore and comprehend: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with street and trench, even in distressful times.&rdquo; This verse mentions seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. Verse 26 continues, &ldquo;After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing; and the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.&rdquo; The &ldquo;cutting off&rdquo; of Messiah indicates prophetically the crucifixion of Christ. The destruction of the city and the sanctuary refers to the destruction of the temple and the city of Jerusalem by the army of Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, in A.D. 70.</p>
<p>Finally, verse 27 says, &ldquo;He will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Antichrist making a firm covenant with the many for one week. In the middle of that week, that is, after three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. This means that he will stop the worship of God in the temple. The seventy weeks, composed of four hundred ninety years, is the time apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king (Neh. 1:1; 2:1) to the end of this age.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENTS OF THE SEVEN WEEKS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Seven Weeks of Forty-nine Years</h2>
<p>The first seven weeks, of forty-nine years, was the time apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding. Even though the environment was extremely distressful, Jerusalem was rebuilt, with street and trench (Dan. 9:25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Sixty-two Weeks of<br />
Four Hundred Thirty-four Years</h2>
<p>The following sixty-two weeks of four hundred thirty-four years were apportioned from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah (vv. 25-26). &ldquo;After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing&rdquo; (v. 26). This refers to the crucifixion of Christ. The cutting off of the Messiah&mdash;the crucifixion of Christ&mdash;was the termination of the old creation with its human government and the germination through the resurrection of Christ of God&rsquo;s new creation with God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom as the divine administration in God&rsquo;s new creation. Thus, the cross of Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>This prophecy concerning Messiah&rsquo;s being cut off is good news, not bad news. Through His death on the cross, Christ terminated the old creation. Then in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to germinate those whom God has chosen and make them a new creation. If we see the issue of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, we will realize that the word in Daniel 9:26 about the death of Christ is good news.</p>
<p>Whereas the first part of verse 26 speaks of the death of Christ, the second part of this verse speaks of another matter: &ldquo;The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.&rdquo; This was a prophecy concerning the prince of the Roman Empire, Titus, who came with his army to destroy the city and the sanctuary&mdash;Jerusalem and the holy temple. The Lord Jesus also prophesied concerning this destruction in Matthew 24:2. This prophecy was fulfilled in A.D. 70. The last part of Daniel 9:26 says, &ldquo;The end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. One Week of Seven Years</h2>
<p>Finally, verse 27 speaks of the last week of seven years. This week will be for Antichrist to make a firm covenant with the people of Israel. Between the sixty-ninth week and the last week, there is a gap, which has already lasted for nearly two thousand years. There is an insertion in Israel&rsquo;s history between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week. This insertion may be called the age of mysteries, the age of grace, or the age of the church. This age includes many mysterious things, such as the resurrection of Christ, regeneration, Christ living in us, and the life-giving Spirit. The history of Israel is physical, with nothing of a mysterious nature, but the history of the church is altogether mysterious. In this gap the children of Israel have been suffering, having lost their fathers&rsquo; homeland and having been scattered to all the earth. Nevertheless, God has not forgotten His people, Israel, but continues to grant them some degree of mercy. Eventually, the last week of seven years will come.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Antichrist Causing the Sacrifice<br />
and the Oblation to Cease</h2>
<p>Antichrist will make a firm covenant with the people of Israel for one week. The covenant that he makes with them will be a peace agreement. However, in the middle of the seventieth week Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease (v. 27). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which will last for three and a half years. During the great tribulation, both the faithful Jews and the Christians still on earth will suffer Antichrist&rsquo;s persecution.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Antichrist Replacing<br />
the Sacrifice and the Oblation<br />
with Abominations of the Desolator</h2>
<p>After he causes the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, Antichrist will replace them with the abominations (idols of Antichrist&mdash;2 Thes. 2:4) of the desolator (Dan. 9:27; Matt. 24:15). The desolator is Antichrist.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Complete Destruction Being Poured Out upon the Desolator</h2>
<p>The end of Daniel 9:27 says, &ldquo;Until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision that Daniel received regarding the seventy weeks was not only a vision but also a report. Daniel understood the seventy weeks, but because we are near to the end of the gap, we understand this matter even better than Daniel. By studying the vision of the seventy weeks in relation to God&rsquo;s economy, we know where we are, who we are, and what we should be doing today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Verses 24 through 27 of chapter 9 are the most precious portion in the book of Daniel. The seventy weeks spoken of in these verses are the key to understanding the prophecies of the Bible. The purpose of the seventy weeks is to close the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. First, seven weeks of forty-nine years were apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding. Even though the environment would be extremely distressful, Jerusalem would be rebuilt, with street and trench. Second, sixty-two weeks of four hundred thirty-four years were apportioned from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of Messiah. Then, &ldquo;the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary&rdquo; (v. 26). This prophesied that Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, would come with his army in A.D. 70 to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, the end of which would be with a flood, and even to the end there would be war. The desolations had been determined. Between the sixty-ninth week and the last week, there is a gap, which has already lasted for nearly two thousand years. This gap is an insertion in Israel&rsquo;s history between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week. This insertion may be called the age of mysteries, the age of grace, or the age of the church. Eventually, the last week of seven years will come, and Antichrist will make a firm covenant with the people of Israel for one week. However, in the middle of the seventieth week, Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. This will mark the beginning of the great tribulation, which will last for three and a half years. During these three and a half years, Antichrist will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with the abominations of the desolator. Eventually, as prophesied by Daniel, the complete destruction that has been determined will be poured out upon the desolator, Antichrist.</p>

<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;s PROMISE TO RESTORE ISRAEL</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies by the Old Testament prophets concerning the children of Israel forsaking God due to their unbelief after they entered the good land, the plagues that they would suffer as a result, and their being captured and scattered among the nations. The prophets also prophesied that the captured children of Israel would repent to God and that God would gather them together and bring them back to the good land to receive blessings from Him and to be restored. In this lesson we will begin to study the prophecies concerning God&rsquo;s promise to restore Israel, starting with the prophecies in Isaiah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. PROPHECIES<br />
CONCERNING THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AGE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophets, including those before the captivity and those during the captivity, prophesied concerning the restoration of Israel. These prophecies are dispersed throughout the books of prophecy in the Old Testament. The content of these prophecies is both detailed and rich. Most of the prophecies were initially and partially fulfilled with the return of the children of Israel from captivity and will be ultimately and fully fulfilled with the restoration of the children of Israel in the millennial age.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Isaiah&rsquo;s Prophecy concerning<br />
the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Causing<br />
the Children of Israel to Return</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Remnant of Jacob Returning to the Mighty God</h2>
<p>Isaiah 10:20-27 prophesies that Israel will be released and return. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;In that day the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped will no longer rely upon him who strikes them, but they will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.&rdquo; To rely upon Jehovah in truth is to rely upon Jehovah in truthfulness. Verse 21 and the first part of verse 22 say, &ldquo;A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. For though your people, O Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant among them will return.&rdquo; Paul quoted this word in Romans 9:27, indicating that a remnant of Israel will be saved. They will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and return to the mighty God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Lord Recovering<br />
the Remnant of His People by His Hand</h2>
<p>Isaiah 11:11-12 says, &ldquo;In that day the Lord, / By His hand for the second time again, / Will recover the remnant of His people / Who remain, from Assyria and from Egypt, / From Pathros, Cush, and Elam, / From Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea. / He will lift up a standard to the nations, / And will gather the outcasts of Israel; / And the dispersed of Judah He will assemble / From the four corners of the earth.&rdquo; The standard that will be lifted up is Christ. At that time, Ephraim&rsquo;s jealousy will depart, and the adversaries in Judah will be cut off. The northern kingdom of Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, the southern kingdom, nor will Judah be hostile toward Ephraim (v. 13). The Lord will take away the divisive element, and these two kingdoms will become one. The restored remnant of Israel &ldquo;will fly down upon the shoulders of the Philistines on the west; / Together they will plunder the children of the east. / Edom and Moab will come into the grasp of their hand, / And the children of Ammon will submit to them&rdquo; (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Destroying the Tongue of the Sea of Egypt,<br />
and There Being a Highway<br />
for the Remnant of His People</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Jehovah will utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt, that is, the gulf of the Red Sea. He will also wave His hand over the River, the Euphrates, with the scorching of His wind. He will strike the Euphrates into seven streams and march men through it dryshod. There will also be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of His people to return (vv. 15-16).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The River&rdquo; spoken of in Isaiah is the Euphrates, which Abraham crossed (Josh. 24:2-3). The great river Euphrates is also mentioned in Revelation 16:12 in relation to the war at Armageddon. In the coming days God will dry up the Euphrates with the scorching heat from the wind. He will also change the situation on the earth and open the way from Assyria to the Holy Land for the children of Israel to return.</p>
<p>Three big problems and frustrations will be solved for the return of the children of Israel. First, the tongue of the sea of Egypt, that is, the Gulf of Suez, which frustrates the traffic from Egypt to the Holy Land, will be destroyed. Second, God will use scorching heat from the wind to dry up the Euphrates into seven streams so that the children of Israel can walk through it. Third, God will build a highway to the Holy Land from Assyria.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Jehovah Gleaning the Children of Israel<br />
from the Flowing Stream of the River<br />
to the Brook of Egypt, like Beating Out Grain</h2>
<p>Isaiah 27:12-13 says, &ldquo;In that day Jehovah will beat out the grain from the flowing stream of the River / Unto the brook of Egypt; / And you will be gleaned / One by one, O you children of Israel. / And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, / And the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come, / As well as the outcasts in the land of Egypt, / And they will worship Jehovah / On the holy mountain in Jerusalem.&rdquo; The grain in verse 12 denotes the scattered people of Israel. According to these two verses, all the Israelites who are outcasts, lost, and scattered will be gathered together and brought back to the good land. The fulfilment of this prophecy began with the return of the captives from Babylon. It is still being fulfilled today, and it will be fully accomplished at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Awakening of the Arm of Jehovah<br />
Causing the Ransomed of Jehovah to Return<br />
and to Come to Zion with a Ringing Shout and Joy</h2>
<p>In verses 9 through 11 of chapter 51, Isaiah cried out for the arm of Jehovah to awaken and put on strength as in the days of old, especially as in the time when His elect came out of Egypt. In their exodus from Egypt, the first obstacle that the children of Israel faced was the Red Sea, which was in front of them, while Pharaoh&rsquo;s army was behind them. The children of Israel could do nothing about the situation, but the arm of Jehovah caused a strong wind to blow so that the water was divided. The sea was dried up, and Israel walked in the sea on dry land. Isaiah was burdened for the arm of Jehovah to do the same thing in his day so that the captives of Israel could be brought back.</p>
<p>In Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy Christ is given the name &ldquo;arm of Jehovah.&rdquo; Christ is the arm of Jehovah, the Triune God, the great I Am. Christ is the arm of Jehovah to save God&rsquo;s people. The arm of Jehovah&rsquo;s awakening and putting on strength as in the days of old is for the ransomed of Jehovah to return and to come to Zion with a ringing shout and eternal joy (v. 11).</p><h2 class="head4">f. Christ as a Standard Being Raised Up<br />
for the Gathering of Jehovah&rsquo;s Scattered People</h2>
<p>At His return Christ will be raised up as a standard for the gathering of Jehovah&rsquo;s scattered people (62:10). At that time, the children of Israel will return. They will see a sign, the raised standard, for their gathering together. Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah, will be the gathering standard.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Restoring and Cleansing Zion<br />
for the Establishing of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Isaiah 52:8 says that Jehovah will restore Zion, and 62:6-9 says that Jerusalem will be established and made a praise in the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Restoring the City of Zion and Its People</h2>
<p>God promised to restore the city of Zion and its people. Afterward, the city will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city (1:26). Zion will be ransomed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness (v. 27). The children of Israel fell into a chaotic situation because they gave up justice and righteousness. However, God&rsquo;s restoration will bring them back to their initial condition.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. He Who Is Left in Zion and<br />
Remains in Jerusalem Being Called Holy</h2>
<p>Verse 3 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;He who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been written down in Jerusalem for life.&rdquo; This indicates that there will be a book of life, in which names are written.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Creating a Canopy<br />
over Zion and Her Convocations and<br />
Providing His Chosen People with a Tabernacle</h2>
<p>According to verse 5, Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day and the brightness of a fiery flame by night to be a canopy of His divine glory over all His interests on the earth. This refers to the God-man, Christ, who as the great canopy will cover Zion and the children of Israel. This is similar to the pillar of smoke and the pillar of fire that went with the children of Israel in the wilderness. Furthermore, in the restoration of Israel, God will provide them with a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat and for a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. From Zion Going Forth Instruction,<br />
and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In the restoration all the earth will be under the teaching of Israel. &ldquo;Many peoples will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, / To the house of the God of Jacob, / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths. / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem&rdquo; (2:3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Isaiah 61:4-9 and Zechariah 8:20-23, during the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom, the restored Israel will be priests. In the millennium there will be both an earthly part and a heavenly part referred to as the priesthood. The restored nation of Israel will be the priests in the earthly part, and the overcoming believers in Christ will be the priests in the heavenly part. By this priesthood all the peoples on earth will be taught and instructed.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Jerusalem Being a Secure Habitation</h2>
<p>Isaiah also prophesied, &ldquo;Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; / Your eyes will see Jerusalem, / A secure habitation, a tent that will not be removed; / Its stakes will never be pulled up, / And none of its cords will be torn apart&rdquo; (33:20). The inhabitant will not say, &ldquo;I am sick,&rdquo; and the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity (v. 24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Righteousness of Zion<br />
Going Forth like Brightness, and<br />
Her Salvation like a Burning Torch</h2>
<p>In the restoration the righteousness of Zion will go forth like brightness, and her salvation like a burning torch as God&rsquo;s crown of beauty and delight (62:1-5). During the restoration, righteousness will be dispensed and transfused into the Jews; therefore, their righteousness will go forth like brightness. Their salvation will also be like a burning torch as God&rsquo;s crown of beauty and delight. God will be beautified by and will be happy and satisfied with what Israel will shine forth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Salvation Coming to the Daughter of Zion</h2>
<p>Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and the people will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah (vv. 10-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Restored Condition of the Children of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Christ Being Beauty and Glory,<br />
and Excellence and Splendor to Israel</h2>
<p>In the day of the restoration the God-man, Christ, as the divine shoot of Jehovah, will be beauty and glory to Israel, and as the fruit of the earth, the human seed, He will be excellence and splendor to them (4:2). In the coming restoration the all-inclusive Christ will be beauty and glory in His divinity to the children of Israel. He will also be their excellence and splendor in His humanity that expresses the beauty and glory of His divinity. The children of Israel will manifest and express the all-inclusive Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Israel Praising Jehovah<br />
and Drawing Water with Rejoicing from<br />
the Springs of Salvation</h2>
<p>According to Isaiah 12:1 in that day Israel will say, &ldquo;I will praise You, O Jehovah. You were angry with me, / But Your anger has turned and You have consoled me.&rdquo; The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;praise&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;give thanks to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation, / And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name!&rdquo; In that day the children of Israel will receive the Lord as their salvation. To receive the Lord as our salvation is to draw water from the springs of salvation. This is strongly emphasized in the New Testament, especially in the Gospel of John, where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (4:14). This fountain becomes rivers of living water in those who believe into Him (7:37-38). This indicates that in the restoration the Lord will become Israel&rsquo;s salvation as the living water.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. There Being Singing in the Land of Judah<br />
and in a Vineyard of Wine</h2>
<p>Isaiah also said, &ldquo;In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: / We have a strong city; / He will set up salvation as walls and a rampart. / Open the gates / So that the righteous nation may enter, / They who maintain faithfulness. / You will keep the steadfast of mind / In perfect peace / Because he trusts in You. / Trust in Jehovah forever and ever, / For in Jah Jehovah we have an eternal rock&rdquo; (26:1-4). Previously, the children of Israel were not faithful, but Israel will become a righteous nation that maintains faithfulness.</p>
<p>In that day there will also be singing of a vineyard of wine (27:2). Jehovah is the keeper of this vineyard. He waters it every moment, and He guards it by night and by day lest anyone visit harm upon it (v. 3). Isaiah also spoke of how Israel will be blessed: &ldquo;In the days to come Jacob will take root; / Israel will blossom and bud; / And they will fill the surface of the world with their produce&rdquo; (v. 6). Verse 9 says that the iniquity of Jacob will be expiated, and the fruit of the removal of their sin is that they will make all the stones of their altars like chalk stones beaten to powder such that the Asherahs and sun images will not stand. This means that Israel will be redeemed. Their Asherahs and their sun images will be no more, for all idols and false altars will be destroyed.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Gaining Increase</h2>
<p>In the restoration the Holy Land will extend from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates (Deut. 11:24). Isaiah 26:15 says, &ldquo;You have increased the nation, O Jehovah; / You have increased the nation&mdash;You are glorified; / You have far extended all the edges of the land.&rdquo; To increase the nation is to increase the people, and to extend the edge is to enlarge the territory.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Eyes of Those Who See Not Being Dim</h2>
<p>As the King, Christ will bring in the restoration of Israel. Then the eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will attend. The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly (32:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Spirit Being Poured upon Them from on High,<br />
and the Wilderness Becoming a Fruitful Field</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit will be poured upon them from on high, the wilderness will become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest. Justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field. The work of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever. Jehovah&rsquo;s people will live in a peaceful habitation and in secure dwellings and carefree resting places (vv. 15-18). During that time, righteousness will work out peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever. Thus, there will be a peaceful habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Israel Being Made an Eternal Excellency and a Joy</h2>
<p>Isaiah 60:15-18 reveals that in her restoration, Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy for generations. Israel will be the excellency of the human race.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Israel Enjoying Jehovah as the Eternal Light</h2>
<p>The restored Israel will enjoy Jehovah in Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the eternal light. Verses 19 through 21 say, &ldquo;You will no longer have the sun for your light by day, / Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; / But Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And your God your beauty. / Your sun will no longer go down, / Nor will your moon withdraw; / For Jehovah will be an eternal light to you, / And the days of your mourning will be ended. / Then all your people will be righteous; / They will possess the land forever, / The branch of My planting, / The works of My hands, / That I may be beautified.&rdquo; Israel will have something brighter than the sun and the moon, for they will have Jehovah as an eternal light. In the restoration Israel will be glorified and beautified to become God&rsquo;s beautification. God will be beautified by the restored and beautified Israel.</p><h2 class="head4">i. Jehovah Blessing Israel<br />
with the Blessing of &ldquo;New Wine,&rdquo; and<br />
Israel Possessing His Mountain</h2>
<p>Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine, and they will possess His mountain, Zion, in order to dwell, eat, drink, and rejoice there (65:8-10, 13-16). In the restoration there will be new wine that will cheer God and His people. Instead of working and laboring, Israel will eat, drink, and rejoice.</p>
<h2 class="head4">j. Rejoicing, Exulting, and Having Abundant Life</h2>
<p>A restoration will be brought in both to Israel and to all things (vv. 18-25). Jerusalem will be an exultation, and her people will rejoice. Even God Himself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in His people, and there will no longer be heard in her the voice of weeping and crying. &ldquo;There will no longer be in her / An infant who reaches the age of only a few days / Nor an old man who does not fill up his days; / For the lad will die at a hundred years of age, / And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed&rdquo; (v. 20). In the restoration an infant will not die before reaching maturity, and one who dies at the age of a hundred will be regarded as a youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will build houses and inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. / They will not build and another inhabit; / They will not plant and another eat; / For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, / And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full&rdquo; (vv. 21-22). This indicates that in the restoration the unique work carried out by God&rsquo;s chosen people will be to sing, praise, worship, and rejoice. Calling on the Lord will be their occupation, and even before they call, He will answer (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>Isaiah also prophesied, &ldquo;The wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox, / And dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food; / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.&rdquo; (v. 25) The prophecies in this verse are similar to those in 11:6-9, which also speak of the restoration brought in through Christ. In the restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Nations Serving Israel, and Israel<br />
Being Priests to All the Nations</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Glory of Jehovah Rising upon Israel,<br />
and the Nations Gathering to Israel</h2>
<p>Isaiah 60:1-9 refers to the time of Israel&rsquo;s restoration when Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will be the glory of Jehovah arising upon Israel. When Christ comes back as the saving Redeemer, Israel as God&rsquo;s elect and as the center of the world&rsquo;s population will be restored in every respect. At that time, all the Gentile nations will be for Israel, and not only Israel&rsquo;s captives but also the wealth of the nations will be gathered to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Nations Building Israel&rsquo;s Walls<br />
and Ministering to Her with Their Wealth and Glory</h2>
<p>The nations will build Israel&rsquo;s walls and will minister to her with their wealth and glory (vv. 10-14). The word <em>glory</em> in verse 13 refers to the products of the nations (Gen. 31:1, 16; Esth. 1:4). The nations will minister to Israel with their wealth and their best products.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Israel Being the Priests of Jehovah,<br />
and the Gentiles Being Laborers to Israel</h2>
<p>In the restoration Israel will be priests of Jehovah, the ministers of their God. The Gentiles will be laborers to serve Israel (Isa. 61:4-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Jehovah Gathering the Nations<br />
to Worship at Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Jehovah will gather the nations to worship at Jerusalem, and they will bring, as a meal offering to Jehovah, the scattered children of Israel, of whom some will be priests (61:6) and some Levites (66:18-21). Today we offer sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16), but in the restoration the nations will bring the scattered Israelites as a meal offering to God. Just as in the Old Testament time, some will be appointed to serve as priests, and others will do the Levitical service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophets prophesied many times concerning the restoration of Israel. Most of these prophecies were initially and partially fulfilled at the return of the children of Israel from captivity and will be ultimately and fully fulfilled at the restoration of the children of Israel in the millennial age. Isaiah prophesied that the remnant of Jacob will return to the mighty God. The Lord will recover the remnant of His people by His hand. Jehovah will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt and prepare a highway for the remnant of His people. Jehovah will glean the children of Israel from the flowing stream of the River unto the brook of Egypt, like the beating out of the grain. The ransomed of Jehovah will return and come to Zion with a ringing shout and joy. Christ will be a standard raised up for the gathering of Jehovah&rsquo;s scattered people. Jehovah will restore and cleanse Zion, and Jerusalem will be established. He who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy. Jehovah will create a canopy over Zion and her convocations and will provide His chosen people with a tabernacle. From Zion will go forth instruction, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be a secure habitation. The righteousness of Zion will go forth like brightness, and her salvation like a burning torch. Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and they will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah. In the restoration of Israel, Christ will be their beauty and glory and also their excellence and splendor. The children of Israel will praise Jehovah and draw water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation. In that day there will be singing in the land of Judah and in a vineyard of wine. The Israelites will be increased. The eyes of those who see will not be dim. The Spirit will be poured upon them from on high, and the wilderness will become a fruitful field. Thus, there will be a peaceful habitation. Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy, and they will enjoy Jehovah as the eternal light. Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine, and they will possess His mountain. There will be rejoicing, exulting, and abundant life in Israel. Then the nations will serve Israel, and Israel will become priests to all the nations. The glory of Jehovah will rise upon Israel, and all the nations will gather to Israel. The nations will build Israel&rsquo;s walls and minister to her with their wealth and glory. Israel will be the priests of Jehovah, and the Gentiles will be laborers to Israel. Jehovah will gather the nations to worship at Jerusalem, and the nations will bring the scattered children of Israel as a meal offering to Jehovah.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to speak on the prophecies in the books of the prophets concerning the restoration of Israel, focusing on the prophecies in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jeremiah&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Promising to Restore Israel</h2>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah prophesied concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s promises to restore Israel (23:3-8).</p><h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Gathering the Remnant of His Flock<br />
out of the Lands Where He Has Driven Them</h2>
<p>Jehovah said that He would gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands where He had driven them and would bring them back to their pasture. He also said that they would be fruitful and would multiply (v. 3). &ldquo;Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when they will no longer say, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up and led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had driven them, that they might dwell in their own land&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). These are promises concerning the restoration of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Jehovah Raising Up Shepherds over Them<br />
Who Will Feed Them</h2>
<p>In verse 4 Jehovah said that He would raise up shepherds over the children of Israel to feed them, that they would no longer fear or be dismayed, and that none of them would be missing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Raising Up to David a Righteous Shoot, Christ,Who Will Reign as King and Act Prudently and<br />
Will Execute Judgment and Righteousness in the Land</h2>
<p>Jehovah said He would raise up to David a righteous Shoot, that is, Christ, who will reign as King and act prudently and who will execute justice and righteousness in the land (v. 5). In the coming restoration Christ will come as the Shoot of David. This means that He will come as the descendant of David. A shoot is a new, fresh sprout of a tree, especially a sprout of a tree that has been cut down. As the Shoot of David, Christ is a new sprout from the stump of David (Matt. 2:23, footnote 3, Recovery Version). The royal family of David was like a large tree. This tree was cut down, mainly by Nebuchadnezzar, because of the apostasy of Solomon and his descendants, and only a stump was left in the earth. When Christ was born, a new, fresh sprout came out of this stump.</p>
<p>The word <em>Shoot</em> indicates Christ&rsquo;s humanity, and it also implies life. The birth of Christ as such a Shoot was wholly a matter of life. This life has grown and spread to such an extent that Christ is now the King to rule and to act prudently. Furthermore, at the time of restoration, Christ will execute justice and righteousness in the land.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. In His Days Judah Being Saved,<br />
Israel Dwelling Securely, and Christ&rsquo;s Name<br />
Being Called Jehovah Our Righteousness</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In His days Judah will be saved, / And Israel will dwell securely; / And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6). This verse reveals that the name of the Shoot is Jehovah our righteousness. Christ, the descendant of David, is not merely a man; He is the very Jehovah who created the heavens and the earth, selected Abraham, and set up the race of Israel. He was David&rsquo;s Lord, the One whom David called Lord (Matt. 22:43).</p>
<p>At Jeremiah&rsquo;s time there was no righteousness among God&rsquo;s people. However, Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot, who is Jehovah Himself, to be the righteousness of God&rsquo;s chosen people (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ was incarnated as a Shoot of David to be our righteousness. When Christ died for us, He shed His blood to wash away our sins and accomplish redemption, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). Based on the redemption accomplished through the death of Christ on the cross, God can justify the believers. We are justified by standing on the redemption of Christ and by receiving Christ as God to be our righteousness. Although we do not have any righteousness in ourselves, we have One who is God Himself yet a man and who died on the cross to shed His blood to accomplish redemption for us. With this redemption as the basis, we can believe in Him to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and God can justify us, make Christ our righteousness, and clothe us with the robe of righteousness (Isa. 61:10).</p>
<p>As the Shoot of David who is Jehovah our righteousness, Christ is the all-inclusive One. With Him we have divinity mingled with humanity. With Him we have the righteousness, that is, God Himself to be our righteousness, and we have redemption. With Him we have the life-giving Spirit and the riches of life, including the element of life, the law of life, and the sense of life. Actually, the life we have in Christ as the Shoot of David and as Jehovah our righteousness is the processed and consummated Triune God. In the restoration Israel will fully gain Christ to be their righteousness. Hence, Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Turning the Captivity<br />
of the Tents of Jacob and Having Compassion<br />
on His Dwelling Places</h2>
<p>Jeremiah said that the restoration of Israel will take place after Jehovah chastises Israel with justice (Jer. 30:10-11).</p><h2 class="head4">a. The City Being Rebuilt on Its Mound,<br />
and the Palace Being Inhabited after Its Own Manner</h2>
<p>Jehovah will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob and will have compassion on his dwelling places. The city will be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner. Out from them will come thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry (vv. 18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The City of Jerusalem Being Built unto Jehovah</h2>
<p>Jehovah declared that days are coming when the city of Jerusalem will be built unto Jehovah (31:38).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Word Being Said When Jehovah<br />
Turns Again Israel&rsquo;s Captivity</h2>
<p>When Jehovah will turn again Israel&rsquo;s captivity, they will say in the land of Judah and in its cities, &ldquo;Jehovah bless you, O habitation of righteousness, / O mountain of holiness&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>Habitation of righteousness</em> refers to Jerusalem, and <em>mountain of holiness</em>, to Mount Zion. Verse 24 says, &ldquo;Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmers and they who wander with the flocks.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Jehovah Satisfying the Weary Soul<br />
and Filling Every Languishing Soul</h2>
<p>Jehovah will satisfy the weary soul and fill every languishing soul (v. 25).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Jehovah Sowing the House of Israel<br />
and the House of Judah<br />
with the Seed of Man and with the Seed of Beast</h2>
<p>Jehovah will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast (v. 27). This indicates that every living thing will be rich in life. Jehovah also said that as He has watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to bring evil, so He will watch over them to build and to plant (v. 28).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Causing Israel<br />
to Multiply and Exist Forever</h2>
<p>Jehovah will multiply Israel so that they will not be few, and He will cause them to be honored so that they will not be small (30:19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Their Children Being as They Were of Old</h2>
<p>According to verses 20 and 21, their children will be as they were of old, and their assembly will be established before Jehovah; their leader will be one of them, and their ruler will come out of their midst; and Jehovah will bring him near, and he will approach Him.</p>
<p>In these verses Jehovah spoke of one leader, not of many leaders. Thus, there will not be different opinions. At that time, the children of God will have no more opinion and no more division.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Seed of Israel Not Ceasing from Being<br />
a Nation before Jehovah Forever</h2>
<p>God promised that the seed of Israel will not cease from being a nation before Jehovah forever, just as the ordinances of the sun, the moon, and the stars, and the roaring of the waves of the sea will never depart. &ldquo;If this order departs / From before Me, declares Jehovah, / Then the seed of Israel will also cease / From being a nation before Me forever&rdquo; (31:36). There is a similar word in verses 25 and 26 of chapter 33: &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah, If My covenant with respect to day and night does not stand, if I have not established the statutes of heaven and earth, then I will also reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant and will not take rulers from his seed to be over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will turn their captivity and will have compassion on them.&rdquo; Both portions use the same illustration to indicate that from the time of the restoration, that is, the coming millennium, Israel will exist forever, just as the universe will exist forever. They will not cease from being a nation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Not Casting Off the Seed of Israel<br />
for All They Have Done</h2>
<p>Jehovah also assured Israel that He will not cast off their seed for all they have done. &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah, / If the heavens above can be measured, / And the foundations of the earth below can be examined carefully, / Then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel / For all they have done, declares Jehovah&rdquo; (31:37). Thus, just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth cannot be examined, the descendants of Israel will never be cut off. God will never cast off the descendants of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Jehovah Making a New Covenant with Israel</h2>
<p>Jeremiah prophesied that Jehovah, as their Husband, would make a new covenant with Israel. &ldquo;Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband, declares Jehovah&rdquo; (vv. 31-32). This is the first portion of the Scriptures where God speaks of making a new covenant with the Jews. According to the Bible, the new covenant is first for the Jews, the people of Israel; it is not first for the Gentiles. <em>Those days</em> in verse 33 refers to the beginning of the millennium at the end of the great tribulation. At that time, God will make a new covenant with the Israelites. God has put us in His new covenant today and has given us the blessings of the new covenant because we have believed into the Lord Jesus. The Israelites will gain the blessings of the new covenant on that day by believing in Jesus as the Lord.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Putting His Law within Them<br />
and Writing It upon Their Hearts</h2>
<p>The first blessing of the new covenant that Israel will receive at the time of the restoration is in the first part of verse 33: &ldquo;This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts.&rdquo; A law that can be put into people and written upon their hearts must be a law of life. This law itself must be a life. Otherwise, it could not be put into men. Furthermore, this law will be written upon men&rsquo;s hearts, indicating that it will spread from the center of their being, their spirit, to the circumference, their heart. Thus, this law must be God&rsquo;s life, the divine life, and God&rsquo;s life is God Himself. The first blessing of the new covenant is that God will put Himself into His chosen people as their life, and this life is a law.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Jehovah Being Their God, and They Being His People</h2>
<p>The second blessing of the new covenant is also in verse 33: &ldquo;I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rdquo; For God to be their God implies a great deal. This means that He will be known by His people, understood by them, apprehended by them, and lived by them. It also means that God&rsquo;s people will be constituted with Him to be utterly one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. They No Longer Teaching Each Man His Neighbor<br />
or Each Man His Brother, for All Will Know Him</h2>
<p>The third blessing of the new covenant is that &ldquo;they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 34). This word indicates that at the time of the restoration, the people of Israel will know God to such an extent that they will not need anyone to teach them.</p>
<p>This is the principle of knowing God through the function of the divine life, the eternal life within man. Eternal life has a special function, and this function is to know God (John 17:3). To know God, the divine person, requires the divine life with its function. Eventually, there will be no need for outward teachings, for Israel will know God by the function of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Jehovah Forgiving Their Iniquity<br />
and Remembering Their Sin No More</h2>
<p>The new covenant has another aspect of blessing: &ldquo;I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more&rdquo; (Jer. 31:34). The sin and iniquity of God&rsquo;s people are great problems, but Christ has dealt with them. Before Jeremiah spoke of the new covenant, he spoke concerning Christ as the righteous Shoot of David, the One whose name will be called Jehovah our righteousness (23:5-6). This One has accomplished redemption; He has taken away our sin. &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (John 1:29). He has solved the problem of sin, and now in Him we have been justified by God, and God has forgiven our iniquity and our sin. Since we have been justified, no obstacle or frustration can keep us from having fellowship with God or prevent Him from dispensing Himself into us. Furthermore, God will remember our sin no more. When Jehovah makes the new covenant with Israel, there will be communication, fellowship, between Israel and God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Restoring the Holy City and the Holy Land</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Bringing the City of Jerusalem<br />
Recovery and Healing</h2>
<p>Jehovah promised to bring the city of Jerusalem recovery and healing and cause its people to be healed. He said that He would reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth and would turn the captivity of Judah and Israel and build them up as in former times. He also promised that He would cleanse them from their iniquity, by which they had sinned against Him and forgive all their iniquities, by which they had sinned and transgressed against Him (Jer. 33:6-8). Jehovah also promised that Jerusalem &ldquo;will be a name of gladness and a praise and a glory to Me before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good that I am about to do for them; and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and because of all the peace that I am about to provide for it&rdquo; (v. 9). In addition to being a promise concerning Jerusalem, this is also a picture of today&rsquo;s church life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. There Being Heard in the City of Jerusalem<br />
the Voice of Gladness</h2>
<p>There will be heard in the city of Jerusalem the voice of gladness, the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say, &ldquo;Praise Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His lovingkindness is forever&rdquo; (v. 11). Jehovah will turn the captivity of the Holy Land.</p><h2 class="head4">c. In the Holy Land There Being a Habitation<br />
of Shepherds Making Their Flock Lie Down,<br />
and the Flock Again Passing<br />
under the Hand of the One Who Counts Them</h2>
<p>God will also multiply the number of the flock of Israel. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;Again there will be in this place which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds making their flock lie down. In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev and in the land of Benjamin and all around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flock will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them, says Jehovah.&rdquo; The Lord will multiply His flock to the extent that they will be uncountable (v. 22). This will be the situation of Israel at the time of the restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Jehovah Not Breaking His Covenant with David<br />
or with the Levites Nor Rejecting Them</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Establishing the Good Word<br />
Which He Has Spoken concerning the House of Israel and concerning the House of Judah</h2>
<p>Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah (v. 14). He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot (Christ) of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness in the land (v. 15). Verse 16 says, &ldquo;In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely; and this is the name by which she will be called: Jehovah our righteousness.&rdquo; In 23:6 Christ is called Jehovah our righteousness, but in 33:16 the city of Jerusalem is called by this name. The fact that both Christ and Jerusalem are called by the same name seems to indicate that in the restoration Christ and the city of Jerusalem will be one, just as Christ and the church are one today.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Jehovah Never Breaking His Covenant<br />
with David His Servant</h2>
<p>As no one can break Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant with respect to the day or His covenant with respect to the night so that day and night are not at their appointed time, so His covenant with David His servant can never be broken; he will always have a son to reign on his throne. Likewise, His covenant can never be broken with the Levitical priests as His ministers (vv. 17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Multiplying the Seed of David His Servant and the Levites His Ministers</h2>
<p>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so Jehovah will multiply the seed of David His servant and the Levites His ministers (v. 22).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ezekiel&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Promise of Restoring Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Setting Up David as a Shepherd over Them</h2>
<p>Concerning the restoration of Israel, Ezekiel prophesied that Jehovah will set up a shepherd to take care of them and to shepherd them. This shepherd is Christ as typified by David. Christ, the real David, will take care of and shepherd Israel at the time of the restoration so that they are filled and satisfied. Christ will also be the Prince to govern them so that they are subject to His kingship (Ezek. 34:23-24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. God Making a Covenant of Peace with Them</h2>
<p>God also promised Israel that He would make a covenant with them (v. 25). This covenant is an everlasting covenant (37:26). Since God will make a covenant with them, He will banish evil beasts from the land (34:25); that is, the evil persons who disturb God&rsquo;s people will cease. God also promised to break all their yokes and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them (v. 27). They will no longer be prey to the nations; rather, they will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid (v. 28).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Making Israel a Blessing</h2>
<p>God further promised that He will make Israel and the places around His hill a blessing, and that He will cause showers to come down in their season; there will be showers of blessing (v. 26). The trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the earth will yield its increase (v. 27). God will raise up for them a planting place of renown, and the fruit will be for the enjoyment of His people. Thus, Israel will no longer be consumed with famine (v. 29).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. God Being the God of Israel,<br />
and Israel Being His People</h2>
<p>Verses 30 and 31 conclude, &ldquo;Thus they will know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people, declares the Lord Jehovah. And you are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your God, declares the Lord Jehovah.&rdquo; In that day Israel will have God&rsquo;s presence, God will be among them, and they will be before God. This is the genuine restoration.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Cleansing Israel and Giving Them<br />
a New Heart and a New Spirit</h2>
<p>Jehovah made a promise to Israel, saying, &ldquo;I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; from all your filthiness and from all your idols I will cleanse you. I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and My ordinances you shall keep and do&rdquo; (36:25-27). God will give them a new heart. This new heart enables them to love God and everything of God. God will put a new spirit within them so that their spirit is enlivened and renewed. God will also give them a heart of flesh so that they are soft and sensitive toward God. God also promised that He would put His Spirit within them so that His Spirit can always strengthen them in their new spirit, causing them to have the strength to love God and to fellowship with Him. Thus, the restored people of Israel in the kingdom age will be able to walk in God&rsquo;s statutes and keep His ordinances.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Holy Temple, the Holy Land,<br />
and the Holy City Being Recovered</h2>
<p>In Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48, the recovery of Israel will include the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city. The captivity of the children of Israel occurred in 606 B.C. About thirty years after their captivity, in 574 B.C., Ezekiel saw the vision of Israel&rsquo;s restoration. Then after approximately forty years, in 536 B.C., some of the Israelites returned to the land of their forefathers as decreed by Cyrus the king of Persia. First, they recovered the altar (Ezra 3:2), then God&rsquo;s temple (vv. 8-13), and finally the city (Neh. 2:17-18). The temple that was built at the time of their return from captivity was eventually replaced by Herod&rsquo;s temple, which was built in forty-six years (John 2:20). However, neither the temple rebuilt in Ezra&rsquo;s days nor Herod&rsquo;s temple at the time of the Lord Jesus could compare in measurement, scale, or glory to the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision. Therefore, what Ezekiel saw concerns Israel in the restoration.</p>
<p>According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, God will gain the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city among the restored Israelites. The emphasis of the holy temple is the presence of God, the fellowship of God, and the service for God. The existence of the holy temple depends on the Holy Land. If there is no Holy Land, there will not be a building site for the holy temple. At the same time, the Holy Land provides a place for those who serve in the holy temple to live, dwell, and enjoy. Therefore, in order to have the holy temple, there must be the Holy Land. The holy city is for government and administration so that God can have a center of administration among His people. The conclusion of the book of Ezekiel is that God will eventually gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land. Whether it is the temple or the city, it is where God is, it is His dwelling place, and it is His resting place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah prophesied concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to restore Israel. Jehovah will gather the remnant of His flock out of all the lands where He had driven them, and will raise up shepherds over them to feed them. In that day Jehovah will raise up to David a righteous Shoot, Christ, who will reign as King and act prudently and who will execute justice and righteousness in the land. Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. The restoration of Israel will take place after Jehovah chastises Israel with justice. The city will be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner. Jehovah will turn again Israel&rsquo;s captivity, and He will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast, and they will be rich in life. Jehovah will multiply the Israelites so that they will not be few, and He will cause them to be honored so that they will not be small. Their children will be as they were of old, and their seed will not cease from being a nation before Jehovah forever. Jehovah will not cast off the seed of Israel because of all that they have done. He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel so that His law is put within them and written upon their hearts. Jehovah will be their God, and they will be His people. They will no longer teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, for all of them will know Him. Jehovah will forgive their iniquity and will remember their sin no more. He will also restore the holy city and the Holy Land, and the city of Jerusalem will be recovered and healed. The voice of gladness will be heard in the city of Jerusalem. In the Holy Land there will be a habitation of shepherds making their flock lie down. Jehovah will never break His covenant with David and the Levites, and He will never reject them. The good word which was spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah will be established. Jehovah will also multiply the seed of David His servant and the Levites His ministers.</p>
<p>The prophet Ezekiel also prophesied concerning the restoration of Israel. God will set up David as a shepherd to care for them, make a covenant of peace with them, and make them a blessing. God is the God of Israel and Israel is His people. Jehovah will cleanse Israel and give them a new heart and a new spirit so that the restored Israelites will walk in His statutes and keep His ordinances. Finally, the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city will be recovered. God will gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land to be His dwelling place and His resting place.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue the last two lessons on the prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel in the books of the Minor Prophets. Furthermore, we will also see the New Testament prophecies concerning Israel being restored.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Hosea&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Becoming the Sons of God</h2>
<p>Hosea 1:10&mdash;2:1 is God&rsquo;s promise to restore the children of Israel. This promise is a matter of grace. Grace follows sin. Where sin abounds, grace superabounds (Rom. 5:20).</p>
<p>Hosea 1:10 says that in the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which is immeasurable and innumerable. Verse 10 also says, &ldquo;In the place where it will be said to them, You are not My people, / It will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.&rdquo; Being sons of God indicates regeneration. When God makes a new covenant with the children of Israel (Jer. 31:31-34), they will have God written into their hearts. This means that they will be regenerated. God will put Himself into them as their life to make them the sons of God. Thus, Israel will be not merely God&rsquo;s people but also the sons of God.</p>
<p>In the restoration when the children of Judah and the children of Israel are gathered together, they will appoint for themselves one head, and they will go up from the land of their captivity; great will be the day of Jezreel, meaning &ldquo;God sows&rdquo; or &ldquo;God will sow,&rdquo; the day for the people of Israel to be sown in the Holy Land by God (Hosea 1:11; cf. 2:22-23). God has sown the children of Israel in their fathers&rsquo; land, and no one can pluck them out again. In that day the Lord will charge the children of Israel to call their brothers Ammi, meaning &ldquo;My people,&rdquo; and their sisters Ruhamah, meaning &ldquo;she has obtained compassion&rdquo; (2:1). Thus, Israel will be perfected. Under the victory of God&rsquo;s love, Israel will become His people and obtain His compassion.</p>
<p>Hosea said that God loves Israel with an everlasting love (11:1; 14:4). Although God is loving, He is also a God of purity and righteousness. He cannot tolerate any kind of uncleanness or unrighteousness. Wherever these things are found among God&rsquo;s people, God&rsquo;s chastisement will follow. For this reason, even though Israel has been re-formed as a nation, they are still under God&rsquo;s chastisement. Nevertheless, even though they are being chastised by God, He still loves them. It is the Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindness that they have not been consumed (Lam. 3:22). Because of His compassion, Israel remains and will eventually be restored.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Returning to Jehovah,<br />
and Jehovah Enlivening Them</h2>
<p>Israel will return to Jehovah. The prophet Hosea said, &ldquo;Come and let us return to Jehovah; / For He has torn us, but He will heal us, / And He has stricken us, but He will bind us up&rdquo; (6:1). Verse 2 says, &ldquo;He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence.&rdquo; According to the principle in the Bible, &ldquo;with the Lord one day is like a thousand years&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:8). Hence, the two days in Hosea 6:2 might each signify the first two periods of a thousand years, counting from A.D. 70, when the Roman prince Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, cruelly killed thousands of Jews, and scattered the Jews among the nations. From that time the Jews have been without king, without prince, without sacrifice, and without the temple, fulfilling Hosea&rsquo;s prophecy in verse 4 of chapter 3. For two thousand years God has left Israel in a dead condition. After this two-thousand-year period, the third thousand years will come. The third day in 6:2 might signify the third period of a thousand years, that is, the millennium, the age of restoration, in the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Having the Rich Produce<br />
of the Earth</h2>
<p>Hosea 6:11 is Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to Judah. Jehovah promised that there will be a harvest appointed for Judah, when He will turn the captivity of His people. This means that in the restoration all the Israelites, including the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, will be very rich in all kinds of produce from the earth. The earth was created by God to produce a rich harvest, but due to the fall of man, the earth was cursed to grow thorns and thistles, and man has had to labor by the sweat of his face (Gen. 3:17-19). In the restoration the earth will be restored to its original condition and will be rich, fertile, and productive. Thus, a harvest will be apportioned to Judah for their enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Having a Wonderful Transformation</h2>
<p>Hosea 14:4-8 is a description, a picture, of Israel&rsquo;s transformation in the restoration (2:15-23; 3:5; 6:1-3; 10:12). Jehovah will heal their apostasy, and He will love them freely, for His anger will turn away from them. He will be like the dew to Israel. Israel will bud like the lily, signifying a pure life trusting in God (Matt. 6:28), and will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon, signifying standing steadily in the uplifted humanity (cf. S. S. 3:9). His shoots will go forth, signifying flourishing and spreading; his splendor will be like that of the olive tree, signifying glory in fruitfulness; and his fragrance will be like that of the trees of Lebanon, signifying the sweet odor of a life in the uplifted humanity. Those who sit under his shade, signifying being overshadowed by the sufficient grace that they enjoy (2 Cor. 12:9), will return. They will revive like grain, signifying being full of life for producing satisfying food, and will bud like the vine, signifying blossoming for producing cheering drink. Israel&rsquo;s renown will be like the wine of Lebanon, signifying a good name spreading like tasteful wine. Israel&rsquo;s transformation as described in these verses is based on the factor of love in life.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Hosea, Israel is a harlot; however, at the end of this book, Israel has become a son of God. Eventually, Ephraim declares that he has no more idols. &ldquo;Ephraim says, What have I yet to do with idols?&rdquo; and God answers, &ldquo;I respond and look on him. / I am like a green fir tree; / From Me your fruit is found&rdquo; (14:8). Jehovah&rsquo;s being like a green fir tree, symbolizing God&rsquo;s being living and evergreen, and Ephraim&rsquo;s bearing fruit from Him indicate Ephraim&rsquo;s oneness with Jehovah. They also indicate that based on the factor of love in life, a wonderful transformation will take place. This is more than an organic union. It is the oneness of two in one life, one nature, and one living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Joel&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Desiring<br />
to Bless His Own Land</h2>
<p>In the book of Joel God desires to bless His land (2:18-27). The holy land is a particular land; it is God&rsquo;s land. God desires to bless His land with the rich produce of the land. God also desires to bless His land by the rains&mdash;the early rain and the late rain. Finally, God desires to bless His land by driving away from His people the enemies sent by Him as the swarming locust, the licking locust, the consuming locust, and the cutting locust, His great army.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Willing to Save Israel</h2>
<p>Joel said that Jehovah is willing to save Israel by pouring out His Spirit as the early rain upon them (vv. 28-29). This prophecy was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 16-21), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste before the great tribulation for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This outpouring is different from the outpouring of the Spirit on the last day of the tribulation (Zech. 12:10) for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging.</p>
<p>The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension. This compound Spirit, who has been poured out, is the realization of Christ and the consummation of the Triune God. There will be a great outpouring of the Spirit as the consummated Triune God upon those Jews who call upon the name of Jehovah and who thus are regenerated and saved for the manifestation of Christ. At that time, God&rsquo;s elect will be saved through their calling on the name of Jehovah (Joel 2:32). The equivalent of this in the New Testament is calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Reigning,<br />
and the Land of Israel Being Blessed</h2>
<p>Finally, Joel spoke regarding Christ&rsquo;s reign in Israel in the age of restoration (3:16-21). After the defeat of Antichrist, Christ will reign in Israel on the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem. As Christ reigns in Jerusalem, He will be a shelter and a stronghold to the children of Israel. Therefore, no one will be able to harm Israel anymore.</p>
<p>Verse 18 speaks of the rich situation in the restoration. The mountains will drop down fresh wine, and the hills will flow with milk. There will be no shortage of water, for all the waterways of Judah will flow with water. Wherever there is a waterway, there will be a river full of water. A fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah, the temple, to water the entire Holy Land. This verse refers to the blessed situation of the land of Israel in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Amos&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Rebuilding<br />
the Fallen Tabernacle of David</h2>
<p>Amos prophesied, &ldquo;In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as it was in the days of old; / That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this&rdquo; (9:11-12). This portion of Amos is quoted by James in Acts 15, when the apostles and the elders were gathered together to resolve the problem of circumcision (vv. 16-18).</p>
<p>The tabernacle of David is the kingdom and the royal family of David. In ancient times it was hard to separate the royal family from the kingdom. Actually, these two things are one. David&rsquo;s kingdom was David&rsquo;s royal family. That kingdom, that royal family, fell when Nebuchadnezzar captured the nation of Israel, devastated the land, burned the city, destroyed the temple, and carried off the king. However, in Amos God came in to promise that one day He would come back to restore the fallen kingdom of David. In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p>This prophecy in Amos indicates that when Christ comes back, in His last appearing, He will be the real David to restore His kingdom and His royal family. That will be the millennial kingdom, in which all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah; that is, all the nations will belong to God. Based on this prophecy, in Acts 15 James told the Jewish believers not to be bothered by Peter and Paul going to the Gentiles, because in the restoration all the Gentiles will belong to God, just like the Jews. This is a great item in Amos&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Turning the Captivity of the People<br />
of Israel and Planting Them upon Their Land</h2>
<p>In Amos 9:14 the prophet said that Jehovah will turn the captivity of His people Israel. They will build the desolated cities and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, and they will make gardens and eat the fruit from them. Eventually, Jehovah will plant the people of Israel upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which He has given to them (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Obadiah&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The House of Jacob<br />
Possessing Edom&rsquo;s Possessions</h2>
<p>The prophet Obadiah prophesied that the house of Jacob will possess Edom&rsquo;s possessions: the mountain of Esau, the land of the Philistines, the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria, Gilead, as far as Zarephath, and the cities of the south (vv. 17, 19-20). This indicates that during the restoration Israel will enlarge their territory&mdash;the kingdom of God on earth.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Saviors Coming Up on Mount Zion<br />
to Judge the Mountain of Esau</h2>
<p>Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah&rsquo;s (v. 21).</p>
<p>These two items were fulfilled at the time of the Maccabees, and they will be further fulfilled in glory at the time of the restoration for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:28; Rev. 11:15). The Maccabees took Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom and gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes in about 165 B.C. The victory of the Maccabees is a type of the victory that Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Micah&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Gathering and Delivering Israel</h2>
<p>The prophet Micah spoke of Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to gather all of Jacob and assemble the remnant of Israel (2:12). Jehovah declares, &ldquo;I will gather her that limps, / And her that has been driven out I will collect, / As well as her that I have afflicted; / And I will make her that limps a remnant, / And her that has been cast far away a mighty nation&rdquo; (4:6-7). Jehovah&rsquo;s comfort to Israel also includes His deliverance of Israel (vv. 9-13). This means that God will meet Israel&rsquo;s every need and solve every problem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel Eating and Drinking<br />
for Enjoyment in Peace</h2>
<p>At the restoration of Israel in the millennium (Matt. 19:28; Rev. 20:4, 6; Isa. 2:2-5), people will no longer learn war (Micah 4:3). Rather, enjoying life without disturbance, &ldquo;they will each sit underneath his vine / And underneath his fig tree, / And no one will disturb them&rdquo; (v. 4). Every person will eat and drink for his enjoyment in peace.</p>
<p>The thousand years of the millennium will be a continual feast. In the Old Testament the children of Israel were charged not to work during the yearly feasts (Lev. 23:7-8, 35). To work during those feasts would have been an insult to God. The people were only to rest, eat, drink, and enjoy their life before God. Their eating and drinking were their worship to God. At the time of the restoration, the life of the Israelites will be such a restful living for worship.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Christ Coming as<br />
Israel&rsquo;s Ruler, Shepherd, and Peace</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 is a prophecy concerning Christ. This verse says that His &ldquo;goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; This means that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth. From the ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter. From the time of His incarnation, He has been coming forth, and His coming forth is still taking place today. Christ&rsquo;s coming forth will be consummated when He throws Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-20), Satan is cast into the abyss (20:2-3), and Christ sets up His throne to reign as King (Matt. 25:31, 34, 40). At that time His appearing will be complete.</p>
<p>While Christ is on the way, He is taking care of the scattered Jews. On the one hand, Israel is under God&rsquo;s chastisement. On the other hand, Israel is also under God&rsquo;s shepherding care. This shepherding is His preservation of Israel. In the restoration Christ will be the Ruler, Shepherd, and peace to His elect, Israel (Micah 5:2-5). As their Ruler, He keeps Israel; as their Shepherd, He nourishes and cherishes them; and as their peace, He controls their environment so that they may enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Remnant of Jacob Being Blessed by Jehovah<br />
and Being Victorious among the Nations</h2>
<p>After Christ deals with all the enemies, the remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they also will be victorious among the nations. Concerning this, Micah prophesied that in the restoration the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from Jehovah, like abundant showers upon the herbage, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among flocks of sheep. The small nation of Israel will be victorious among the nations, her hand will be raised up against her adversaries, and all her enemies will be cut off. Jehovah will clear up the armies, cities, strongholds, sorceries, idols, and idol worship from Israel. Furthermore, He will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations (vv. 7-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Zechariah&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Desiring Israel to Be Restored</h2>
<p>Zechariah 8 reveals Jehovah&rsquo;s desire to restore Israel. He will return to Zion, and He will dwell within Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, the Holy Mountain (v. 3). Old men and old women will dwell in Jerusalem with their staff in their hand due to the multitude of their days, and the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing (vv. 4-5). This indicates that the city will be peaceful and very pleasant. Men and women, young and old, will have the real enjoyment of life. The situation of Jerusalem in the restoration will be so pleasant that it will be wonderful both in the sight of the remnant of Israel and in the sight of Jehovah (v. 6). When the people see the pleasantness of Jerusalem, they may say, &ldquo;This is wonderful!&rdquo; and God will also say, &ldquo;Yes, this is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jehovah will save His people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun and bring them to Jerusalem so that they may dwell in it. They will be Jehovah&rsquo;s people, and Jehovah will be their God in truth and in righteousness (vv. 7-8). The land of the east is Babylon and the land of the going down of the sun is Spain. At that time Spain was considered the uttermost part of the earth, the place of the sunset.</p>
<p>The vine will give forth its fruit, the land will give forth its produce, and the heavens will give their dew, that is, their rain. Jehovah will cause the remnant of Israel to inherit these blessings (v. 12). Because of these blessings, the entire country will be fruitful and productive for the enjoyment of the people. Once they were a curse among the nations, but Jehovah will save them, and they will be a blessing. Therefore, they should not fear; their hands should be strong. Just as Jehovah intended to do harm to them when their fathers provoked Him to anger, and He did not repent, so He intends in those days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah (vv. 13-15). God will be good to them in every way. Finally, &ldquo;the fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth month and the fast of the seventh month and the fast of the tenth month will become joy and rejoicing and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah&rdquo; (v. 19). Instead of fasts, there will be feasts full of good food for the enjoyment of the people of Israel. This is a promise related to Israel&rsquo;s restoration.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The People of Israel<br />
Being Priests to the Nations</h2>
<p>The prophet Zechariah also prophesied that the nations will come to Israel to entreat the favor, the grace, of Jehovah, and the children of Israel will be priests to them (vv. 20-23). At that time, not just one country but peoples, even the inhabitants of many cities from different countries, will come to Israel. &ldquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, Let us go at once to entreat the favor of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of hosts; and the other: I will go too&rdquo; (v. 21). Moreover, &ldquo;indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 22). This will be the situation in the millennium. Not only all the people of Israel, but also the Gentiles who are living with them will seek God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold, indeed, they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you&rdquo; (v. 23; cf. Isa. 2:2-3). This implies that God will reverse the situation of Babel and deal with the problem caused by the different languages among the nations. God did this once already, at Pentecost (Acts 2). What happened at Pentecost is a prefigure of what will take place during the age of the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>The children of Israel will be priests to the nations (Isa. 2:3-4). In the millennial kingdom, after the Lord&rsquo;s return and the salvation of the Jews, the entire nation of Israel will be a priesthood. They will teach the Gentiles, the nations, to know God&rsquo;s way and God&rsquo;s person, and they will teach them to worship and serve God. As priests, they will bring the nations into the presence of God that they may be enlightened, corrected, and favored with all the riches of God. This is the priesthood. According to Exodus 19:6, God&rsquo;s intention was to have Israel as a nation of priests, and He has never forgotten this. God has been waiting for an opportune time to fulfill this, but He has not yet had the opportunity. In the time of the restoration, all the Israelites will be priests. They will be very busy as priests to the nations, teaching them how to worship and serve Jehovah. The nations were formerly idol worshippers or atheists, but they will turn to God, and God will turn to them to be their God. Therefore, they will need to learn how to worship and serve Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Stopping All Their Warfare</h2>
<p>Zechariah 9:10 says, &ldquo;I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.&rdquo; This indicates that in the millennial kingdom, God will cause all warfare to cease. This is the result of Christ&rsquo;s coming (v. 9). Christ&rsquo;s coming issues in peace and restoration and brings in God&rsquo;s dominion. In the restoration the first item is peace: &ldquo;He will speak peace unto the nations.&rdquo; The second item is dominion: &ldquo;His dominion will be from sea to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Christ came the first time, He was welcomed for only a short period and was ultimately rejected, detested to the uttermost, and put to death by being crucified. Because the children of Israel rejected Christ the King, the restoration was suspended, and the children of Israel entered into a time of judgment. This time of judgment has lasted nearly twenty centuries. Therefore, Christ needs to come a second time. However, this time He will not be riding a donkey; rather, He will come like lightning (Matt. 24:27). Then peace and the eternal kingdom, as God&rsquo;s dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Jehovah God Pouring Out on the House of David and on the Inhabitants of Jerusalem<br />
the Spirit of Grace and of Supplications</h2>
<p>Zechariah 12:10 says, &ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications; and they will look upon Me, whom they have pierced.&rdquo; In Acts 2 God poured out His Spirit upon all flesh (v. 17), and three thousand were saved. However, when God pours out the Spirit of grace upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, thousands of Israelites, even the entire race of Israel, will be saved.</p>
<p>The Spirit of grace in Zechariah 12:10 is a sweet term. It is in contrast to the Spirit of power in Acts 1:8 and 2:1-4. The Spirit of power is for strengthening, but the Spirit of grace is for bringing people into the enjoyment of the Triune God. In Acts 2, the beginning of the age of grace, the church age, the Spirit was mainly the Spirit of power. In Zechariah 12, at the ending, the consummation, of the age of grace, the Spirit will be mainly the Spirit of grace for the enjoyment of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Providing the House of David and<br />
the Inhabitants of Jerusalem<br />
with an Opened Fountain for Sin and for Impurity</h2>
<p>At the time of the restoration, the Israelites will obtain the divine provision of a Redeemer with His redemption. God will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an opened fountain, Christ&rsquo;s pierced side, for sin and for impurity (John 19:34, 37). &ldquo;In that day there will be an opened fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity&rdquo; (Zech. 13:1).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Jerusalem Being Blessed</h2>
<p>In the millennium there will be no thirst, because living waters will go forth from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, the Dead Sea, and half of them toward the western sea, the Mediterranean Sea (14:8). This is similar to what Ezekiel said concerning the living water flowing out of the temple of God (47:1-2). Furthermore, in the millennium Jehovah as Christ will be King over all the earth; He will be the one God and His name, the one name (Zech. 14:9). Jerusalem will be raised up and will dwell in her place (v. 10). People will dwell in Jerusalem, and there will be no more curse, for Jerusalem will dwell securely (v. 11). Instead of a curse, there will be blessing with security. Everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles (v. 16). Whoever will not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, will not have rain; instead, there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations. This will be their sin (vv. 17-19). Because the present age is the age of grace, God sends rain on the just and the unjust alike (Matt. 5:45). But the coming age will be the age of righteousness. Those who do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles will not receive rain. This is righteous.</p>
<p>In the millennium &ldquo;on the horses&rsquo; bells will be, Holiness to Jehovah; and the pots in the house of Jehovah will be like the basins before the altar&rdquo; (Zech. 14:20). Pots are small, and basins are large. However, in the millennium the pots in the house of God will be as large as the basins before the altar. &ldquo;Indeed every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holiness to Jehovah of hosts; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them; and there will never again be a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts in that day&rdquo; (v. 21). In that day there will be no merchant in the house of God. This is Israel&rsquo;s destiny in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Malachi&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ, the Angel of the Covenant,<br />
Executing upon Israel the Covenant That<br />
He Enacted through His Death</h2>
<p>The prophet Malachi prophesied that Christ will come suddenly to His temple as the Angel of the covenant. He is the Lord whom the people of Israel seek and whom the people of Israel desire (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7). He will execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death (Matt. 26:28). He came as an Angel to serve God in forming the new covenant. When He established His table on the night in which He was betrayed, He took up the cup and said, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant established in My blood&rdquo; (Luke 22:20). Thus, He enacted the new covenant, in which God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, our law of life, and our everything as our inward content. Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, most Israelites have not benefited from it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time, they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Refining and Purifying the Sons of Levi</h2>
<p>Christ will come also like a refiner&rsquo;s fire and like fuller&rsquo;s soap to refine and purify the sons of Levi, mainly the priests, so that they may offer to God the proper sacrifice (Mal. 3:2-4). In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to care for all the nations. In order to care for the nations, they will need much refining and purifying. Therefore, in His second coming Christ will renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His refined and purified priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. PROPHECIES<br />
CONCERNING THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT AGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Revelation Given<br />
by the Lord in Matthew 24</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24 the Lord gave a clear revelation concerning the restoration of Israel. In verse 32 the Lord said, &ldquo;Learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.&rdquo; In verse 19 of chapter 21, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus cursed a fig tree because He could not find any fruit on it. The fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8). Since Israel was stubborn and rebellious and had no fruit that could satisfy God, she was rejected by Him. In A.D. 70 Titus, the Roman prince, brought a great army to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, as prophesied by the Lord when He said, &ldquo;There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down&rdquo; (Matt. 24:2). From the time that Jerusalem was destroyed, the children of Israel have been scattered among the nations. Not only did their nation fall, but even their homeland was lost.</p>
<p>The fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel, passed through a long winter after it was cursed. Winter signifies a time of being dried up, a time of tribulation. Then in 1948 the nation of Israel was restored. That was the branch of the fig tree becoming tender and putting forth its leaves (v. 32). To become tender signifies that life has come back; to put forth leaves signifies engaging in outward activities. Therefore, verse 33 continues, &ldquo;So also you, when you see all these things, know that it [summer] is near, at the doors.&rdquo; Summer signifies the restoration of the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6; Luke 21:30-31). When the nation of Israel becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, we know that the summer, the full restoration of the Messianic kingdom, is near.</p>
<p>Although Israel has been restored according to the prophecy of the Lord, the restoration of Israel is not yet in fullness. As far as population and geography are concerned, there has not been a full restoration of Israel. However, the restoration of the nation of Israel is becoming more and more full. At the time of the millennium, the restoration will reach its fullness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Mystery Spoken by Paul in Romans 11</h2>
<p>In Romans 11:25 Paul says, &ldquo;I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery (lest you be wise in yourselves), that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.&rdquo; The <em>fullness of the Gentiles</em> refers to the repentant and believing Gentiles. Now is the time for many Gentiles to repent. Hence, the fullness of the Gentiles has not yet been completed. It is continuing at the present time. When &ldquo;the fullness of the Gentiles comes in,&rdquo; according to Paul&rsquo;s declaration in verse 26, &ldquo;all Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rsquo;&rdquo; At that time all the remaining Israelites will be saved. This is the restoration of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Hosea prophesied that in the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which is immeasurable and innumerable. They will not be merely the people of God but also the sons of God. Israel will return to Jehovah, and He will enliven them after two days. On the third day He will raise them up, and they will live in His presence. When Jehovah turns the captivity of His people, there will be a harvest appointed for Judah. Israel will have a wonderful transformation based on the factor of love in life. Joel prophesied that God desires to bless His land and is willing to save Israel. Jehovah will reign, and the land of Israel will be blessed. The mountains will drop down fresh wine, and the hills will flow with milk. A fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah, the temple, to water the entire Holy Land. Amos prophesied that Jehovah will rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah. Jehovah will turn the captivity of the people of Israel and plant them upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which He has given to them. Obadiah prophesied that the house of Jacob will possess Edom&rsquo;s possessions. Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah&rsquo;s. Micah prophesied that Jehovah will gather and deliver Israel so that when Israel is restored in the millennium, they will eat and drink for their enjoyment in peace. Christ will come as Israel&rsquo;s Ruler, Shepherd, and peace. The remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they will also be victorious among the nations. Zechariah prophesied that Jehovah desires to restore Israel. He will save His people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun and bring them to Jerusalem where they will dwell. The children of Israel will be priests to the nations and will teach the nations to worship and serve God. All the fighting of the Israelites will cease. Peace and the eternal kingdom, as God&rsquo;s dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea. Jehovah God will also pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications. He will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an open fountain for sin and for impurity. Jerusalem will be blessed, and living waters will go forth from Jerusalem. Malachi prophesied that Christ, the Angel of the covenant, will execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death. At that time all the repentant and believing Jews will become beneficiaries of the new covenant. Christ will also renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His priests.</p>
<p>There are also prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel in the New Testament. The Lord prophesied in Matthew 24 that when the branch of the fig tree, which signifies the nation of Israel, becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, which happened when the nation of Israel was restored in 1948, we should know that the summer, the full restoration of the Messianic kingdom, is near. Paul says in Romans 11 that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, after which all Israel will be saved.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Revelation is a book of prophecy (1:3; 22:7). Most of its content refers to things to come. In this lesson we will see the visions of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in the book of Revelation, as well as the prophecies concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SEVEN SEALS, THE SEVEN TRUMPETS,<br />
AND THE SEVEN BOWLS</h2>
<p>The first four seals cover the history of the world from Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the end of this age (6:1-8). With the opening of these seals there are four horses with their riders, signifying the gospel, war, famine, and death respectively. This has been the situation of the history of the world during the past twenty centuries. Since Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the gospel has been preached. Throughout the centuries, along with the preaching of the gospel, there has been war. War brings in famine, and famine brings in death. With the fifth seal there is the cry of the martyred saints (vv. 9-11). As a result of the preaching of the gospel throughout the centuries, many saints have been martyred. Close to the end of this age these martyred saints will cry to God for vengeance. The sixth seal, which takes place close to the beginning of the great tribulation, involves the shaking of the earth and heaven (vv. 12-17) and will be a warning to earth&rsquo;s dwellers, reminding them that there is a God in the universe. At that time, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for evil men to live boastfully. The seventh seal includes the seven trumpets and will last for eternity.</p>
<p>The seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets are the judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the moon, and the stars (8:7-12). As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live. The fifth trumpet, which is the first woe as a judgment on men, will be the beginning of the serious woes of the great tribulation (8:13&mdash;9:11). The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe and a further judgment on men, is also a part of the great tribulation (vv. 12-21). The seventh trumpet consists of the eternal kingdom of Christ; the third woe comprising the seven bowls; the judgment of the dead; the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and the God-fearing people; and the destruction of the destroyers of the earth (11:14-18). The third woe will be the closing of the great tribulation. After this there will be the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and those who fear God&rsquo;s name. These three categories of people have been produced throughout the generations. The prophets are mainly from the Old Testament, the saints from the New Testament, and those who fear the name of God will be produced during the great tribulation. The seventh trumpet also contains the judgment of the dead, and the destruction of Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and all their followers. Hence, the seventh trumpet includes everything from the end of the great tribulation to eternity.</p>
<p>The seven bowls, which are a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet as the last plagues of God&rsquo;s wrath on men, will be the end of the great tribulation (15:1, 6-8; 16:1-21).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SEVEN SEALS</h2>
<p>In Revelation 4 John saw the scene in heaven after Christ&rsquo;s ascension. He saw the throne of God as the center and God sitting on the throne ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. John &ldquo;saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals&rdquo; (5:1). These seven seals are the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation. They are a record of God&rsquo;s thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.</p>
<p>John also saw that no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it; hence, he wept much (vv. 2-4). While John was weeping, one of the elders said to him, &ldquo;Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals&rdquo; (v. 5). Christ&rsquo;s overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals.</p>
<p>John then saw &ldquo;a Lamb standing as having just been slain&rdquo; (v. 6). <em>Having just been slain</em> indicates that the Lamb was recently slain. This indicates that the scene in heaven depicted by John in these verses is immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension into heaven. Having passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ in ascension is qualified to open the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy contained in the seven seals.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Four Seals</h2>
<p>The first four seals consist of four horses with their riders (6:1-8). All four riders are personified. The rider of the first horse, the white horse, is the gospel (v. 2); the rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war (v. 4); the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine (v. 5); and the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death (v. 8). Immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, beginning from the first century the gospel has been spreading for twenty centuries, and war has been proceeding simultaneously. War always causes famine, and famine issues in death. These four things will continue to run until the end of this age.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Rider of the White Horse</h2>
<p>The rider of the white horse is the preaching of the gospel. White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable. The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both by men and by God. John saw &ldquo;a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer&rdquo; (v. 2). The rider had a bow without an arrow. This indicates that the arrow has already been shot to destroy the enemy, and the victory has been won for the constitution of the gospel of peace. The fighting is over, and the gospel of peace is proclaimed in a peaceful way. Throughout all the centuries, wherever the gospel is proclaimed, it has conquered and has overcome all kinds of opposition and attack. The gospel is still conquering today.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Rider of the Red Horse</h2>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, another horse, a red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him authority was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and to him a great sword was given.&rdquo; In this verse red signifies the shedding of blood. Thus, the red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood. <em>To take peace from the earth, that men should slay one another,</em> and <em>to him a great sword was given</em> clearly indicate war. These are prophecies. Since Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the preaching of the gospel has been followed by war.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Rider of the Black Horse</h2>
<p>Verses 5 and 6 say, &ldquo;When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it had a balance in his hand. And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&rdquo; Black, indicating dearth (Jer. 14:1-4), signifies the color of the visage of famished people (Lam. 4:8-9; 5:9-10). The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes a black visage. A balance is a scale used to weigh precious things. However, in Revelation 6:5-6 it is used to weigh food, showing the scarcity of food (Lev. 26:26; Ezek. 4:16). During times of famine, oil and wine are always short and become precious. Famine always follows war, and war causes food to be scarce.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Rider of the Pale Horse</h2>
<p>Revelation 6:7-8 say, &ldquo;When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and he who sits upon it, his name is Death; and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth.&rdquo; <em>Pale,</em> or pale green, signifies the color of the appearance of those stricken with the plague. Thus, the pale horse is a symbol of the killing of death, causing a pale appearance. In these verses Hades follows death in order to receive those whom death kills.</p>
<p>Revelation, which was written at the end of the first century, is a prophecy of things to come. These four seals are prophecies, signifying that after the ascension of Christ, there would be the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death. Everything that has transpired during the past twenty centuries can be included in these four things. Immediately after Christ ascended to the heavens, the preaching of the gospel began. The white horse began to run the race, and the rider of this horse was the gospel of the glory of Christ. In A.D. 70 Titus, the prince of Rome, destroyed Jerusalem with his armies. Since then, throughout the centuries, there has been one war after another. War brings in famine, and famine causes disease and death. Hence, the history of the past two thousand years has been nothing except the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Fifth Seal</h2>
<p>The fifth seal discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age. It may include the martyrdom of the Old Testament saints (Matt. 23:34-36). While the gospel is being preached, as indicated by the first seal, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Stephen, Peter, and nearly all the other apostles were martyred. The apostle John was exiled, and Paul was imprisoned and later sentenced to death. Throughout the centuries, wherever the gospel has been preached, there have been martyrs.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Cry of the Martyred Saints</h2>
<p>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, John saw &ldquo;underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo; (Rev. 6:9-10). The souls of the martyred saints being under the altar indicates that, in the eyes of God, they have been offered to God as sacrifices on the altar, and their blood, their life, was shed there. Now their position is under the altar, that is, in the Paradise underneath the earth (cf. Luke 23:43; Matt. 12:40; Acts 2:27; Luke 16:22-26). After having waited for a long time, near the end of this age the martyred saints will cry out for revenge, urging the Lord to judge and avenge their blood &ldquo;on those who dwell on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Lord&rsquo;s Approval</h2>
<p>The martyrs cried with a loud voice, and &ldquo;to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed&rdquo; (Rev. 6:11). The white robe signifies that their martyrdom has been approved by God. Those &ldquo;who were about to be killed, even as they were&rdquo; is a prophecy that refers to those who will be martyred during the great tribulation (20:4). According to the words <em>yet a little while, until also the number...is completed,</em> this cry of the martyred saints should transpire near the end of this age. Today we are still in the first four seals. The fifth seal has not yet come; however, we are close to the time of the fifth seal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Sixth Seal</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Beginning of Supernatural Calamities</h2>
<p>The sixth seal (6:12-17) is the beginning of supernatural calamities and is God&rsquo;s answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal. After the opening of the sixth seal, the Lord comes in to shake the earth and the hosts of the heavens. There will be a great earthquake, the sun will become black as sackcloth made of hair, the moon will become as blood, the stars of heaven will fall to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind, heaven will recoil like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island will move out of its place (vv. 12-14). This great shaking will warn the dwellers on the earth to repent and turn to God. Some people have blasphemously said that they are God. The Lord will shake the earth and heaven to remind them that He is God.</p>
<p>According to the prophecy in Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets in Revelation 8:6&mdash;9:11. Joel 2:30-31 first records the blood of the first and second trumpets, the fire of the first, second, and third trumpets (Rev. 8:7-10), and the smoke of the fifth trumpet (9:1-3), and then the changes of the sun and the moon of the sixth seal. According to Revelation 9:4 and 7:3, the fifth trumpet is very close in time to the sixth seal.</p>
<p>There will be two calamities in the shakings and changes of the earth and of the hosts in heaven. The first will occur before the great tribulation (Joel 2:30-31), and the second will occur after the great tribulation (3:11-16; Matt. 24:29-30; Luke 21:25-26). What is covered in the sixth seal is the first supernatural calamity, which is close to the beginning of the coming great tribulation. Following the sixth seal, at the opening of the seventh seal, are the first four trumpets (Rev. 8:1-2, 6-12). Then the most serious woes of the great tribulation will be carried out in the last three trumpets (8:13&mdash;9:21; 11:14-19).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Reaction of the Earth&rsquo;s Dwellers</h2>
<p>When the supernatural calamities begin, the earth&rsquo;s dwellers&mdash;the kings of the earth, the great men, the generals, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free man&mdash;will hide &ldquo;in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&rdquo; (6:15-17). Actually, this will not yet be the great day of God&rsquo;s wrath; it will be only a foretaste and a warning to them to repent. The calamities are God&rsquo;s answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal. They reveal that God is soon to come in to avenge the blood of His dear saints and to vindicate Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. God&rsquo;s People Being Preserved</h2>
<p>Following the sixth seal is the seventh seal (8:1). The opening of the seventh seal by the Lamb will bring in the seven trumpets, the last three of which constitute the most serious woes of the great tribulation. However, before the sixth seal transpires, God will do two things to preserve His people: He will seal the chosen remnant of Israel, and He will begin the rapture of the redeemed ones of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. One Hundred and Forty-four Thousand<br />
among the Chosen Ones of Israel<br />
Being Preserved on the Earth</h2>
<p>God will first seal one hundred forty-four thousand out of the tribes of the sons of Israel, sealing twelve thousand out of each of the twelve tribes (7:4-8). These are the Israelites who will keep the commandments of God during the great tribulation (12:17; 14:12). These one hundred forty-four thousand faithful Israelites will be sealed on their foreheads in order to be preserved from the torment of God&rsquo;s judgment in the fifth trumpet (9:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Overcomers among the Redeemed Saints<br />
Being Raptured to the Heavens<br />
and Thereby Preserved</h2>
<p>In addition to the chosen remnant of Israel God has another people&mdash;the redeemed saints of the church (7:9-17). The Israelites are God&rsquo;s earthly people, and the Christians are God&rsquo;s heavenly people. In order to preserve the faithful ones among His earthly people, God will seal them but still keep them on the earth. However, God&rsquo;s way of preserving the overcomers among His redeemed saints is not to keep them on earth but to take them away from the earth to the heavens by means of rapture.</p>
<p>The overcomers, among the redeemed saints, whom God will rapture comprise the man-child in 12:5, the firstfruits in 14:1-5, and the other overcoming believers living in this age (3:10; Luke 21:36; Matt. 24:39-42). Their rapture is before the sixth seal, because the sixth seal will be the beginning of supernatural calamities executed by God as the trial that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). At the end of the great tribulation, God will continue to rapture His redeemed saints. He will rapture the two witnesses in 11:12, the late overcomers in 15:2, and the harvest (the majority of the believers) in 14:14-16. These saints will pass through the great tribulation and will not be raptured until before the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Seventh Seal</h2>
<p>The seventh seal consists of the seven trumpets, for the seven trumpets are the content of the seventh seal, and the seventh trumpet consists, in part, of the seven bowls. Both the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet continue for eternity. The seventh trumpet will close this age and usher in the kingdom, the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When the Lamb &ldquo;opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour&rdquo; (8:1). Silence in heaven indicates solemnity because the age is about to be changed. The period before the opening of the seventh seal is the age of God&rsquo;s toleration. For the sake of His purpose of preaching the gospel to produce the churches to fulfill His eternal plan, God has been tolerating the sinful situation on earth. But with the opening of the seventh seal, the age of toleration will be terminated, and another age will be initiated&mdash;the age of God&rsquo;s wrath. When the seventh seal is opened, God will come in to intervene in the rebellious and sinful situation on earth. Heaven will be silent because this occasion is so solemn.</p>
<p>In the midst of this solemn scene, Christ appears as another Angel (v. 3) to execute God&rsquo;s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints. When He offers the prayers of His saints to God, He adds His incense to the prayers for them to be acceptable to God (v. 4).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake&rdquo; (v. 5). This is God&rsquo;s answer to the prayers of the saints, especially the prayer in the fifth seal (6:9-11) and the prayer in Luke 18:7-8. God&rsquo;s answer to the saints&rsquo; prayers is the execution of His judgment upon the earth by the seven trumpets. At this moment John saw the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepare themselves to trumpet (Rev. 8:6).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE SEVEN TRUMPETS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Trumpet&mdash;the Judgment on the Earth</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth; and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up&rdquo; (v. 7). When the angels begin to trumpet, everything in the universe will be turned upside down. The first trumpet will damage the third part of the earth. Note that this verse does not say &ldquo;a third part&rdquo; but &ldquo;the third part.&rdquo; This means that a certain part of the earth, the third part, will be damaged. The whole earth is sinful, but some parts of the earth are particularly evil, satanic, and demonic. Those regions of the earth that are so sinful will be &ldquo;the third part of the earth.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s judgment of the third part will be used to warn the rest of the rebellious world to repent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Second Trumpet&mdash;the Judgment on the Sea</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The second angel trumpeted, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). The second trumpet will damage &ldquo;the third part of the sea.&rdquo; In the same principle as the judgment upon the earth in the first trumpet, God will judge the third part of the sea. The part of the sea that is more defiled by evil against God will be damaged by God&rsquo;s judgment. Verse 9 specifically mentions the destruction of the third part of the ships.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Third Trumpet&mdash;the Judgment<br />
on the Rivers and on the Springs of Waters</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell out of heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters. And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters because they were made bitter&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). Here again the third part of the rivers and springs of waters will be damaged. Water is crucial to human life. The opposers of God and those who practice evil against Him still enjoy God&rsquo;s creation. They partake of the water of God&rsquo;s creation, and they continue to oppose God. One day God will cause wormwood to fall out of heaven into their water, and it will become bitter. However, God&rsquo;s judgment has a limitation; it is limited to the third part of the rivers and springs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Fourth Trumpet&mdash;the Judgment<br />
on the Heavenly Hosts</h2>
<p>The fourth trumpet is for the judgment on the heavenly hosts. &ldquo;The fourth angel trumpeted, and the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them would be darkened and the day would not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise&rdquo; (v. 12). After the judgment of the earth, the sea, and the rivers, God&rsquo;s judgment will smite the third part of the heavenly hosts, damaging the third part of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The part of the sun to be damaged will be the part that shines upon the evil nations. God knows this part, and it will be darkened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Fifth Trumpet&mdash;Satan Falling Out<br />
of Heaven to the Earth</h2>
<p>At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will fall out of heaven to the earth. Verse 1 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;The fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star out of heaven fallen to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss.&rdquo; The star in this verse refers to Satan, who will be cast down from heaven to earth. In the Bible the angels are likened to stars (Job 38:7; Rev. 12:4). As the archangel, Satan was the Daystar (Isa. 14:12). At the time of Luke 10:18 he had already been judged. However, in Revelation 9 and in 12:9-10 there is the execution of that judgment. After the man-child is raptured to heaven, he will fight against Satan and cast him down. According to chapter 12, Satan will fall from heaven at the beginning of the last three and a half years.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Locusts</h2>
<p>When Satan falls from heaven to earth, the key of the abyss will be given to him so that he may open the abyss to release the demon-possessed locusts that will torment men for five months. Verses 3 through 5 of chapter 9 say, &ldquo;Out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and to them power was given, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree, but men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.&rdquo; These locusts must be demon-possessed, because they come out of the smoke which issues from the dwelling place of the demons (v. 2). Verses 7 and 9 are very similar to Joel 2:4-5, 25, and 1:6, which was spoken concerning Israel. This, along with the fact that the Israelites need to be sealed by God to escape the injury of the locusts (Rev. 7:3-8), may indicate that the woe of the fifth trumpet is especially upon the Israelites. At that time, only those Israelites who have the seal of God on their foreheads will not be injured by the demon-possessed locusts.</p>
<p>For those who are tormented, the torment will be so excruciating that &ldquo;in those days men will seek death and shall by no means find it; and they will long to die, and death flees from them&rdquo; (9:6). During those five months, those who are tormented by the dreadful, demon-possessed locusts would rather die than live, but they cannot find the means to die. Surely the shaking of the earth and the blackening of the sun are nothing compared to the severity of this woe. This is the first of the three woes announced by the eagle from mid-heaven in 8:13.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Antichrist</h2>
<p>Verse 11 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.&rdquo; The angel of the abyss is the beast, Antichrist, who will also come out of the pit of the abyss (11:7; 17:8) to lord it over the locusts. In Hebrew the angel of the abyss is called Abaddon, which means &ldquo;destruction.&rdquo; In Greek he will have the name Apollyon, which means &ldquo;destroyer.&rdquo; Antichrist will do much destroying (Dan. 8:23-25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sixth Trumpet&mdash;<br />
the Loosing of the Four Angels</h2>
<p>Revelation 9:12 says, &ldquo;The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things.&rdquo; At the fifth trumpet Satan will fall from heaven to earth in order to damage the earth and persecute the people of God for three and a half years (12:10, 12-17, 6). At the same time, Antichrist will come up out of the abyss and collaborate with Satan to torment people, persecute the saints, and blaspheme God (13:5-7; 11:7). It is also in the same three and a half years, forty-two months, that the holy city of Jerusalem will be given to the Gentiles for destruction (v. 2). Therefore, the woe of the fifth trumpet must be the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). The second woe of the sixth trumpet and the third woe of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 8:13; 9:12; 11:14) must be two parts of the most severe woes of the great tribulation. Hence, the damage caused by the sixth seal, the first four trumpets, and the three woes will be the &ldquo;hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo; (3:10). The two woes spoken of in 9:12 are the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet (vv. 13-21; 11:14-15), which is the seven bowls (ch. 16).</p>
<p>Concerning the second woe, 9:13 and 14 say, &ldquo;The sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.&rdquo; The four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates are four evil, fallen, and rebellious angels who followed Satan. &ldquo;The four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men&rdquo; (v. 15). This means that the killing will last one hour, then one day, then one month, and then one year. The four angels will use two hundred million horsemen to kill the third part of men (v. 16). The riders on the horses will have &ldquo;breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone&rdquo; (v. 17). &ldquo;The power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they harm men&rdquo; (v. 19). The sixth trumpet must be related to the pouring out of the sixth bowl upon the great river Euphrates to dry up its water so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared (16:12). Hence, these troops will move from the east to the west, passing through the Euphrates, to come to the richest region on earth&mdash;the Middle East&mdash;and join the war at Armageddon (vv. 12-16; 19:17-21).</p>
<p>John also said, &ldquo;I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs; for they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty&rdquo; (16:13-14). &ldquo;They gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon&rdquo; (v. 16). These two hundred million horsemen from the east and armies from the north and the west will be gathered together to seize the riches of the many nations that are in that area. At this moment, Christ will come to tread &ldquo;the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty&rdquo; (19:15). &ldquo;The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia&rdquo; (14:20). When Christ comes back to earth, He will destroy the evil armies.</p>
<p>The second woe of the sixth trumpet is a continuation of the serious woes of the great tribulation (11:14). However, verse 20 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;The rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.&rdquo; God intends that through His judgment men would repent, but these verses show that they will not repent.</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Seventh Trumpet&mdash;the Completion<br />
of the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The seventh trumpet is the last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52). Without the seventh trumpet, God&rsquo;s economy and His move cannot be completed. Hence, in the days of the seventh trumpet the mystery of God will be finished (Rev. 10:7). When the seventh trumpet sounds, many things will happen (11:14-18). The seventh trumpet will sound for a period of time, and it will last for eternity, announcing and proclaiming God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>The seventh trumpet has a negative aspect and a positive aspect. The negative aspect includes (1) the last plagues of the seven bowls, in which the wrath of God is finished (15:1; 16:1-21), as the last woe to those who dwell on the earth (8:13; 9:12; 11:14); and (2) the destruction of the destroyers of the earth immediately upon the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to the earth (17:14; 18:1-2; 19:19&mdash;20:3). The positive aspect includes (1) the coming of the eternal kingdom of Christ, which is the kingdom in its manifestation (11:15, 17); (2) the judgment of the dead before the resurrection of the saints to know who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium (1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 20:4-6) and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium (vv. 11-12); and (3) the giving of the reward, at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), to the prophets and the saints after the resurrection and rapture of the saints (1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17) and the giving of the reward, at the throne of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Matt. 25:31-34), to those who fear God&rsquo;s name (Rev. 14:6-7). Hence, the seventh trumpet comprises all the events from the end of the great tribulation to eternity future, such as the last plagues of the seven bowls (ch. 16); the resurrection and rapture of the saints, including the two witnesses; the rewarding of the saints; the marriage of the Lamb (19:7-9); the coming back of Christ to the earth; the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, their followers, the material Babylon the Great, and Satan (18:1&mdash;19:4; 19:11&mdash;20:3); the reigning in the millennial kingdom (vv. 4-6); the final judgment upon the earth and Satan (vv. 7-10); the final judgment of the dead (vv. 11-15); and the ultimate consummation in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity (21:1&mdash;22:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE SEVEN BOWLS</h2>
<p>The seven bowls (ch. 16), as the third woe (11:14), are a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet. These seven bowls contain the last seven plagues (15:1).</p>
<p>John saw when &ldquo;the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). Bowls, being small, signify limitation. Although the last seven plagues are the ultimate fury of God, His fury is nonetheless limited; otherwise, the entire earth and all its inhabitants would be destroyed. God is rich in mercy. For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God still exercises limitations in His ultimate fury in judgment upon the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Bowl</h2>
<p>John heard &ldquo;a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth. And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came to be an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image&rdquo; (16:1-2). In His last fury, God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast. This malignant sore will be on the citizens of the revived Roman Empire under Antichrist, because they bear the name of Antichrist or the number of his name.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Second Bowl</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died&rdquo; (v. 3). The sea in this verse should not include all the seas. Probably, it will mainly be the Mediterranean Sea, the sea enclosed by Antichrist&rsquo;s empire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Third Bowl</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood&rdquo; (v. 4). After this, an angel who has power over the waters will praise God, saying, &ldquo;You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things; for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy of it&rdquo; (vv. 5-6). There will also be praise from the altar concerning God&rsquo;s judgments being true in nature and righteous in principle (v. 7).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Fourth Bowl</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire. And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). The men who are burned with great heat, who blaspheme the name of God, and who refuse to repent must be mainly the citizens of the Roman Empire who follow Antichrist to persecute God&rsquo;s people and to rebel against God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Fifth Bowl</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). The fifth bowl is poured on the throne of the beast. This indicates that the seven bowls are for judging the beast, his kingdom, and his territory, causing the kingdom of the beast to become darkened. Those in the kingdom of Antichrist will gnaw their tongues, blaspheme God, and still refuse to repent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sixth Bowl</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared&rdquo; (v. 12). Both the plague of the sixth bowl and the woe of the sixth trumpet (9:14) are related to the great river Euphrates. According to verses 14 and 15, when the sixth angel sounds the trumpet, the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates will be released. In verse 14 of chapter 16 the kings of the earth are stirred up to send their armies to gather at Armageddon. At the outpouring of the sixth bowl, the water of the Euphrates will be dried up so that these kings and their armies may pass over it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Seventh Bowl</h2>
<p>When the seventh bowl is poured out upon the air, a loud voice will come &ldquo;out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done&rdquo; (v. 17). This means that everything both for judgment and for God&rsquo;s expression, His testimony, has been accomplished. Immediately after this word is spoken, there will be lightnings, voices, thunders, and the greatest earthquake that the world has ever seen (v. 18). This earthquake, the same as the one mentioned in verse 19 of chapter 11, will cause the great city, Jerusalem, to be divided into three parts and the cities of the nations to fall (16:19). Jerusalem will have become as evil as ancient Sodom; hence, God will judge it by means of this earthquake. &ldquo;Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath&rdquo; (v. 19). In verse 8 of chapter 14 the religious, mysterious Babylon is destroyed at the beginning of the great tribulation. Therefore, Babylon the Great in verse 19 of chapter 16, which will be destroyed after the war at Armageddon at the end of the great tribulation, must be the material Babylon, the city of Rome. Rome gave the wine of the fury of her fornication to the faithful saints among the nations (18:3); hence, God in vengeance will give her the wine of the fury of His wrath.</p>
<p>Finally, &ldquo;great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent [approximately one hundred pounds], came down out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague of it is exceedingly great&rdquo; (16:21). This hail will come down mainly upon the citizens of the empire of the beast. In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God. They have no intention to repent. Rather, they will fight against God to the end.</p>
<p>After the seven bowls, the great tribulation will end, this age will close, the mystery of God will be completed (10:7), and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (11:15). After the close of this age, another age, the age of the kingdom, the millennium, will begin. Then the Lord will reign in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Revelation is a book of prophecy; most of its content refers to things to come. In the visions of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls, there are many important prophecies. The first four of the seven seals cover the history of the world from the ascension of Christ to the end of this age. These four seals signify the gospel, war, famine, and death. At the opening of the fifth seal, there is the cry of the martyred saints. At the opening of the sixth seal, there is a great earthquake to warn the dwellers on the earth, reminding them that there is a God in the universe. The seventh seal includes the seven trumpets and will last for eternity.</p>
<p>The seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets are for judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars. As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live. The fifth trumpet, the first woe of the judgment on men, will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe and a further judgment on men, is a part of the great tribulation. The seventh trumpet consists of the eternal kingdom of Christ; the third woe, comprising the seven bowls; the judgment of the dead; the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and of the God-fearing people; and the destruction of the earth&rsquo;s destroyers. The third woe will be the closing of the great tribulation. Then there will be the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and those who fear God&rsquo;s name. The seventh trumpet also comprises the judgment of the dead, the destruction of Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and all their followers. Hence, the seventh trumpet includes everything from the end of the great tribulation to eternity.</p>
<p>The seven bowls, as a part of the negative contents of the seven trumpets, are the last plagues of God&rsquo;s wrath on men and will be the ending of the great tribulation. After the seven bowls, the great tribulation will end, and this age will close. Furthermore, the mystery of God will be completed, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ. Then another age, the kingdom age, the millennium, will begin. The Lord will reign in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Daniel 9:24-27 is the prophecy of the seventy weeks apportioned for Israel and for the holy city. According to history, from the time that Cyrus the king of Persia issued the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Christ was crucified on the cross was a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, that is, four hundred eighty-three years. After this, there is a period of grace, the age of the church, that separates the sixty-nine weeks and the last week. Therefore, of the seventy weeks apportioned by God for Israel, only the last week remains to be fulfilled. In this lesson we will see the prophecies in the Bible concerning Israel in the last week.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ANTICHRIST MAKING A FIRM COVENANT<br />
WITH MANY PEOPLE</h2>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 24:1-2 was fulfilled when Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, destroyed Jerusalem and the temple of the Jews in A.D. 70. This also fulfilled the prophecy in Daniel 9:26: &ldquo;The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.&rdquo; After the destruction of the city and the sanctuary, the children of Israel had no way to offer sacrifices and oblations in the temple. This situation will continue until the last week. At the beginning of the last week, Antichrist will make a covenant with the many (v. 27), agreeing that the Jews can offer sacrifices to worship God in the restored and rebuilt temple. Hence, Antichrist&rsquo;s making a covenant with the many and the Jews recovering their worship in the temple are an indication that the last week of the seven years has begun.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ANTICHRIST CAUSING<br />
THE SACRIFICE AND THE OBLATION<br />
TO CEASE AND SETTING UP<br />
HIS OWN IMAGE IN THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>During the first half of the last week, Antichrist will be kind to the Jews. However, in the middle of the last week, that is, after three and a half years, his attitude will change. Although he initially agrees that the Jews can offer sacrifices to worship in the temple, he will change his attitude and begin to mistreat the Jews. Daniel 9:27 says, &ldquo;In the middle of the week he [Antichrist] will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.&rdquo; Antichrist will order the Jews to stop worshipping God and offering sacrifices.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:15 the Lord Jesus spoke of seeing &ldquo;the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place.&rdquo; Antichrist will stop the Jews from worshipping God, exalt himself as God, and put his image in the temple. This is an abomination in the eyes of God. Verse 21 says, &ldquo;At that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.&rdquo; This great tribulation will last for three and a half years, that is, the second half of the last week. This great tribulation will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BEAST OUT OF THE SEA<br />
AND HIS PERSECUTION</h2>
<p>Revelation 12 says that the dragon is defeated and cast out of heaven to the earth. This will be the beginning of the great tribulation of three and a half years. After coming to the earth, the dragon will stir up the beast from the sea. Therefore, when John saw the dragon standing on the sand of the sea (v. 18), he also saw a beast coming up out of the sea (13:1). This beast is Antichrist.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being like a Leopard,<br />
His Feet like Those of a Bear,<br />
and His Mouth like That of a Lion</h2>
<p>John said, &ldquo;The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion&rdquo; (v. 2). The leopard symbolizes the swift and cruel movement of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece; the feet of the bear symbolize the stamping and destroying feet of the monarchy of Medo-Persia; and the mouth of the lion symbolizes the devouring mouth of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. The beast that John saw has the characteristics of the three beasts in Daniel 7:4-7. Hence, he will be the totality of all the evil powers in human history and the ultimate issue of all the worldly powers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Coming Up out of the Sea and<br />
Having Seven Heads and Ten Horns</h2>
<p>Revelation 13:1 says that a beast will come up out of the sea. Geographically, this sea is the Mediterranean Sea and the &ldquo;Great Sea&rdquo; in Daniel 7:2. According to biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (Rev. 17:15). The beast coming up out of the sea indicates that Antichrist will come out of the Gentile world.</p>
<p>In Revelation 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8 we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. However, verse 1 of chapter 13 and Daniel 7:3 say that he will come up out of the sea. This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which exists in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. Daniel 8 says that he will come out of one of the four kingdoms of ancient Greece (vv. 8-9, 21-23).</p>
<p>The beast has &ldquo;ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy&rdquo; (Rev. 13:1). According to this verse, the beast is the same as the dragon (12:3) because they both have seven heads and ten horns. This emphatically indicates that the coming Antichrist will be one with Satan. Satan will be embodied in Antichrist and expressed through him; hence, Satan&rsquo;s seven heads and ten horns will be the seven heads and ten horns of Antichrist.</p>
<p>The ten horns are the ten kings (17:12), signified by the ten diadems on the ten horns. The ten horns are also ten kingdoms, symbolized by the ten toes of the great image in Daniel 2:42-44. The seven heads of the beast are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire (Rev. 17:10), signified by the seven diadems on the seven heads (12:3). The first five Caesars are Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. The sixth Caesar is Domitian, who was alive when John wrote the book of Revelation. The seventh Caesar, who will eventually suffer a death blow and be resuscitated by the spirit of the fifth Caesar, Nero, will be Antichrist. These seven Caesars all claimed to be God, assumed deity, and forced their people to worship them as God. Hence, the seven heads of the beast bear names of blasphemy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Receiving Power, the Throne,<br />
and Great Authority from the Dragon</h2>
<p>The dragon will make the beast one with him by giving him his power and his throne and great authority (13:2). When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was tempted by the devil. The Lord Jesus defeated him, saying, &ldquo;Go away, Satan! For it is written, &lsquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve&rsquo;&rdquo; (Matt. 4:10). Since that day Satan has been looking for someone to whom he could give all his power, his authority, and the glory of his kingdom. He will find the one he has been seeking in the person of Antichrist. Because Satan will give his power and authority to Antichrist, Antichrist will become an extraordinary person.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Killed and Resuscitated</h2>
<p>Revelation 13:3 says, &ldquo;One of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.&rdquo; Verse 14 also says that the beast &ldquo;had the stroke of the sword and revived.&rdquo; This will cause the whole earth to marvel after him (v. 3). &ldquo;Those who dwell on the earth, those whose names are not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life, will marvel when they see the beast&rdquo; (17:8).</p>
<p>According to chapter 9, the angel of the abyss emerged shortly after Satan, as the star, fell from heaven to earth. About this time the seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire will be killed. The spirit of Caesar Nero will be released from the abyss and enter into the body of the slain seventh Caesar to resuscitate his corpse and to make him the eighth Caesar. This eighth Caesar will have the body of the seventh Caesar and the spirit of the fifth. This resuscitation will be a counterfeit to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Anyone who does not have the faith of Christ will certainly be attracted by this miraculous occurrence.</p>
<p>During the first half of the last seven years, the seventh Caesar will appear. After he is slain and resuscitated, which will take place near the middle of the seven years, he will become the eighth Caesar. Hence, during the first three and a half years, he will be the seventh Caesar, and during the last three and a half years, he, as the resuscitated Antichrist, will be the eighth Caesar. The seventh Caesar will confirm a covenant with the Jews for seven years, and the eighth Caesar will persecute the Jews and exalt himself as God. Hence, Antichrist &ldquo;is also the eighth and is out of the seven&rdquo; (17:11).</p>
<p>This slain and resuscitated Antichrist will have the number of Caesar Nero. The false prophet will cooperate with Antichrist and cause &ldquo;all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead&rdquo; (13:16). No one will be able to buy or sell anything unless he has &ldquo;the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name&rdquo; (v. 17). Verse 18 says, &ldquo;Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.&rdquo; The number six hundred sixty-six denotes Caesar Nero. The unbelievers will bear the name of Nero on their forehead or on their hand, testifying that they belong to Nero. Anyone who does not have the mark of the beast upon him will not be able to buy or sell. This will make it impossible to live.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Acting for Forty-two Months</h2>
<p>This beast will act for forty-two months (13:5). These forty-two months are the three and a half years in verse 14 of chapter 12 and the thousand two hundred and sixty days in verse 3 of chapter 11 and verse 6 of chapter 12, which will be the time of the great tribulation. In these three and a half years Antichrist will do many things. He will utter blasphemies against God, to blaspheme God&rsquo;s name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven (13:6). The beast will make war with the saints and overcome them (v. 7). The saints in verse 7 refer to the rest of the woman&rsquo;s seed in verse 17 of chapter 12, which consists of the Jews, who keep God&rsquo;s commandments, and the believers in Christ, who bear the testimony of Jesus on earth at that time. Antichrist will persecute them, war against them, and overcome them. Many will be martyred during this time.</p>
<p>Antichrist will also receive the power, authority, and the kingdom of the ten kings (17:13), enabling him to rule over every tribe, people, tongue, and nation (13:7). Hence, &ldquo;all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (v. 8). <em>From the foundation of the world</em> may modify both <em>whose name is not written</em> and <em>the Lamb who was slain.</em></p>
<p>Antichrist and the ten kings, the ten horns, &ldquo;will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire&rdquo; (17:16). This indicates that after Antichrist has been resuscitated, he will persecute every kind of religion, including Judaism and Catholicism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Antichrist Being the Fourth Beast in Daniel 7</h2>
<p>The beast out of the sea is the last and crucial part of the fourth beast in Daniel 7:7-8 and 19-26. Both in Daniel and Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but particularly to Antichrist. Hence, eventually Antichrist is the beast out of the sea, the fourth beast in Daniel 7. This beast is dreadful and frightful (vv. 7, 19). Just as the Roman Empire did dreadful things, in the future Antichrist will also do dreadful things to damage people. This beast is exceedingly strong, indicating that the Roman Empire was the strongest heathen power in history and had once conquered all the neighboring powers. Likewise, Antichrist will also subdue and conquer all the powers around the Mediterranean Sea. This beast has large iron teeth and claws of bronze (vv. 7, 19) for devouring or crushing and for standing or trampling respectively. He will devour and crush the whole earth (v. 23). This applies firstly to the ancient Roman Empire with its Caesars and then to the coming Antichrist. This beast will trample down the remainder with its feet.</p>
<p>This beast has ten horns (vv. 7, 20, 24). These ten horns correspond to the ten kings represented by the ten toes of the great image in Daniel 2. In God&rsquo;s view these ten kings are the lowest part of the body; however, in the vision in Daniel 7 these ten kingdoms, represented by the ten kings, are exalted as the ten horns. From the perspective of heaven, worldly politics and worldly kingdoms are very low. In the eyes of God, they are like wild beasts, which do nothing except damage and devour people. However, in the eyes of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in human eyes, the worldly kingdoms seem to be a great and glorious image.</p>
<p>This beast has a small horn&mdash;Antichrist&mdash;that comes up among the ten horns (vv. 8, 20, 24-26). This small horn has eyes like the eyes of a man, indicating that Antichrist will be intellectually brilliant. He will be a man full of knowledge and will possess great insight. He will not only know political science but will also possess the most up-to-date scientific knowledge. This small horn also has a mouth that speaks great things against the Most High (v. 25). It has an appearance that is greater than its companions (v. 20). Antichrist will be so strong, stout, imposing, and attractive that he will be able to subdue many simply by the power of his presence.</p>
<p>Not only will Antichrist be arrogant and blasphemous, but he will also wage war with the saints. He will persecute the God-fearing Jews and the Christ-believing Christians. That small horn will also wear out the saints of the Most High, and his intention will be to change the times and the law (vv. 21, 25). According to the book of Leviticus, God appointed at least seven yearly feasts for the Jewish people. The law refers to the law of God given to His people through Moses. Because these feasts are related to the worship of God, and because Antichrist will oppose any kind of religion, he will abolish all the feasts and change the laws that the people of Israel received from God through their forefathers.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Antichrist Being the Little Horn in Daniel 8</h2>
<p>Antichrist will not only be the fourth beast in Daniel 7 but also the little horn revealed in Daniel 8:8-12 and 21-25. This little horn denotes Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria, who invaded Jerusalem and plundered the temple between 171 and 165 B.C. Antiochus Epiphanes typifies the coming Antichrist. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;The male goat became very great. But once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.&rdquo; The goat in this verse refers to Alexander the Great of the Grecian Empire. Alexander the Great had four generals. After his death these generals occupied certain territories and were divided into four kingdoms. These four kingdoms are the four conspicuous horns. &ldquo;Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful&rdquo; (v. 9). <em>South</em> refers to Egypt, <em>east</em> refers to Syria, and <em>that which is beautiful</em> refers to the Holy Land. Hence, Antichrist as the little horn will arise probably either from Greece or Macedonia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this little horn &ldquo;grew great, as high as the host of heaven; and it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them. Indeed, he grew in greatness to that of the Prince of the host&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). Verse 25 says that he will stand up against the Prince of princes. This means that the little horn will exalt himself against God and take away the daily sacrifice (v. 11), stopping the worship of God by the Jews. Even though the Jews have returned to the land of their fathers, they are presently in a very poor situation, being full of sins and transgression. Therefore, God will be disgusted with their offerings. Because of their transgression, He will allow Antichrist to cause the sacrifice to cease.</p>
<p>Antichrist, the little horn, will also throw down the place of the sanctuary of the Prince of the host (v. 11). This indicates that he will destroy the rebuilt temple. He will &ldquo;cast truth down to the ground&rdquo; (v. 12), abolishing and tearing down every truth. He will take action and prosper (vv. 12, 24). &ldquo;His power will be mighty, but not by his own power&rdquo; (v. 24). Antichrist&rsquo;s power will be the power of Satan. Revelation 13:2 says that &ldquo;the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&rdquo; Since Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan, he will &ldquo;destroy in an extraordinary manner&rdquo; (Dan. 8:24) the mighty men and the holy people. He will also destroy cities and even nations in an unprecedented manner, and he will also destroy the people of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Antichrist Being the Prince in Daniel 9</h2>
<p>Antichrist is also the prince in Daniel 9:26-27. In the last seven years of this age Antichrist will confirm a covenant of peace with Israel, permitting the Jews to offer sacrifices and to worship God according to their religion. However, after three and a half years Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, bring in both abominations and idols, and destroy both the holy city and the temple.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Antichrist Being the King in Daniel 11</h2>
<p>Antichrist is also the king in Daniel 11:36-45. This king is typified by Antiochus Epiphanes (vv. 21-35). Antiochus damaged the temple and polluted the sanctuary by sacrificing a sow in the temple. Judas Maccabaeus, a strong man of Judah, rose up and fought against him. Antiochus opposed the holy covenant that God had made with His people (vv. 28, 30) and removed the daily sacrifice (v. 31). Furthermore, he set up in the temple the abomination that desolates (v. 31). In the last three and a half years, Antichrist will do the same. He will &ldquo;exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things...And he will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any other god; for he will magnify himself above all&rdquo; (vv. 36-37).</p>
<p>Antichrist will &ldquo;enter the countries and overflow and pass through&rdquo; (v. 40); &ldquo;he will also enter the beautiful land&rdquo; (v. 41) to take over the Jewish nation. &ldquo;He will pitch the tents of his palace between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain&rdquo; (v. 45). The sea in verse 45 is the Mediterranean Sea, and the beautiful holy mountain refers to Zion, which is in Jerusalem. Antichrist will pitch the tents of his palace between the Mediterranean Sea and Mount Zion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ANGEL OF THE ABYSS<br />
BRINGING DESTRUCTION</h2>
<p>Antichrist is also the angel of the abyss in Revelation 9:11. He will come out of the abyss (11:7; 17:8) and will possess the spirit of Caesar Nero. As the angel of the abyss, Antichrist will be the king of the demon-possessed locusts (9:1-11). At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will fall to the earth and will be given the key of the pit of the abyss (v. 1). After Satan has been cast down to earth, he will use the key of the pit of the abyss to release an army of extraordinary, demon-possessed locusts. The spirit of Nero will also be released at the time that the locusts are released from the abyss. Thus, Antichrist will become the king of this army of locusts. These locusts will torment men for five months. This will be the first of the three woes, the beginning of the woes of the great tribulation. During the last three and a half years, the angel of the abyss will be consumed with rage, will be obsessed with a satanic hatred, and will bring destruction wherever he goes.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE COMING OF THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul prophesied in 2 Thessalonians 2 that Antichrist will be &ldquo;the man of lawlessness..., who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God...so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). His coming &ldquo;is according to Satan&rsquo;s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie and in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). All that Antichrist does will become a trial to those who dwell on the earth during the last three and a half years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE BEAST OUT OF THE EARTH<br />
AND HIS PERSECUTION</h2>
<p>Besides Antichrist, Revelation speaks of another beast, the false prophet, who will come up out of the earth (13:11). Geographically, the false prophet will come from underneath the earth, and symbolically, he will come from the nation of Israel. Hence, the false prophet must be one of the Jewish people. The beast out of the earth &ldquo;had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon&rdquo; (v. 11). This indicates his falsehood. He will appear to be like a lamb but will speak like the dragon, Satan. He will employ satanic power to perform great signs and will do the same thing that Elijah did; that is, he will call down fire from heaven (v. 13). Since the false prophet will perform the same great signs that the real prophets perform, it will be difficult for people to discern the real prophet from the false prophet.</p>
<p>The false prophet will not work for himself but for Antichrist, the beast out of the sea. Satan will give his power also to the false prophet, and Antichrist will place complete confidence in him. The false prophet will be authorized to represent Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan. Satan will be embodied in Antichrist, and Antichrist will be represented by the false prophet. Hence, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will become one. As a result of this union, the false prophet will be authorized to do whatever he desires.</p>
<p>The false prophet will not only exercise the power of Antichrist but also the authority of Antichrist (v. 12). He will also cause the earth and the earth&rsquo;s dwellers to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed. The false prophet will be eloquent and powerful, and his ministry will be to convince people to worship Antichrist. He will deceive those who dwell on the earth and command them &ldquo;to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived&rdquo; (v. 14). He will also be given the power &ldquo;to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed&rdquo; (v. 15). The false prophet will actually be able to give the breath of life to the idol, enabling it to speak as a living image. This surely will be an astonishing sign to the earth&rsquo;s dwellers, causing them to worship the image of Antichrist. Furthermore, all men will be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead (v. 16). Without the mark, no one will be able to buy or sell, making it impossible to live without the mark (v. 17). Only those whose names have been written in the book of life of the Lamb will not worship Antichrist and his image. They will refuse to worship him, even at the cost of their lives (12:11). As a result, many will be martyred.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, destroyed Jerusalem and the temple of the Jews in A.D. 70. Thus, the children of Israel had no way to offer sacrifices and oblation in the temple. This condition will continue until Antichrist makes a covenant with Israel, allowing the Jews to offer sacrifices to worship God in their restored and rebuilt temple. This will mark the beginning of the last week of the seventy weeks apportioned by God for Israel and the holy city. During the first half of the last week, Antichrist will be very kind to the Jews. However, after three and a half years, he will begin to mistreat the Jews and order the Jews to stop worshipping God and offering sacrifices. At that time, Antichrist will exalt himself as God and put his image in the temple. This will mark the beginning of the great tribulation, which will take Jerusalem as the center and the land of Judea as the circumference. The great tribulation will last for three and a half years.</p>
<p>When the dragon is cast out of heaven to the earth, it will stir up the beast to come up out of the sea. Antichrist, the beast who comes up out of the sea, is like a leopard, his feet are like those of a bear, and his mouth is like that of a lion. The beast has seven heads and ten horns. On his horns are ten diadems, and on his seven heads are names of blasphemy. He will be given power, the throne, and great authority from the dragon. He will act for forty-two months. This beast is the fourth beast in Daniel 7, the little horn in Daniel 8, the prince in Daniel 9, and the king in Daniel 11.</p>
<p>Antichrist is also the angel of the abyss; he will come out of the abyss and will possess the spirit of Caesar Nero. During the last three and a half years, he will be consumed with rage and obsessed with a satanic hatred, and he will bring destruction wherever he goes. The apostle Paul prophesied in 2 Thessalonians 2 that Antichrist will be the man of lawlessness, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God and that he will sit in the temple of God, setting himself forth and saying that he is God. His coming will be a trial to those who dwell on the earth during the last three and a half years.</p>
<p>Besides Antichrist there will also be the false prophet, who will come up out of the earth. He will appear to be like a lamb, but his speaking will be like the dragon, Satan. He will employ satanic power to perform great signs and do the same things that the real prophets do. He will cause those who dwell on the earth to worship the image of Antichrist. Hence, all men will be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead. Without the mark they will not be able to buy or sell, and it will be impossible for them to live. Only those whose names have been written in the book of life of the Lamb will not worship Antichrist and his image. As a result, a great many will be martyred.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies concerning Israel in the last week of the seventy weeks prophesied in Daniel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE GREAT RED DRAGON<br />
AND HIS PERSECUTION</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 12 after the man-child is raptured to the throne of God, there will be war in heaven. This war is between Satan and his angels and Michael, the archangel, and his angels. When there is no longer any place in heaven for the dragon, he will be defeated and cast down to the earth. His coming to the earth will be the beginning of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Cast Down<br />
from Heaven to the Earth</h2>
<p>After the dragon is cast down from heaven to the earth (vv. 9-10, 13), he will persecute the woman who brought forth the man-child. This means he will concentrate his hatred on God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Casting Water like a River<br />
out of His Mouth after the Woman</h2>
<p>The dragon, the serpent, will &ldquo;cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current&rdquo; (v. 15). In this verse <em>water</em> signifies the armies that will be sent by Satan to destroy the people of God (Isa. 8:7-8; 17:12-13; Jer. 46:7-9; 47:2-3). Satan will stir up the kings of the earth to gather their armies to persecute the people of God. Three unclean spirits like frogs will proceed out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet (Rev. 16:13). These unclean spirits will &ldquo;go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty&rdquo; (v. 14). These three spirits will instigate the rebellious kings to send their armies to persecute God&rsquo;s people, which will include the Jews and the believers. The people of God who are left to pass through the great tribulation may have to suffer this persecution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Making War with the Rest of the Woman&rsquo;s Seed</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:17 says, &ldquo;The dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; <em>The rest of her seed</em> signifies the people of God who are not a part of the man-child. Among the people of God, some will be the Jews &ldquo;who keep the commandments of God,&rdquo; and some will be the believers who &ldquo;have the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Satan will not only persecute the woman but will also make war with the rest of her seed, that is, with the weaker part of the woman.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Woman Being Given the Two Wings<br />
of the Great Eagle to Fly into the Wilderness</h2>
<p>&ldquo;To the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place&rdquo; (v. 14). The great eagle signifies God, and the two wings signify His strength to rescue (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12). Just as God brought the children of Israel out from Pharaoh&rsquo;s persecution, He will bring His people away from Satan&rsquo;s persecution in the great tribulation. The mighty God will afford His people divine strength to escape Satan&rsquo;s persecution.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Earth Opening Its Mouth and Swallowing the River Cast out of the Dragon&rsquo;s Mouth</h2>
<p>Even though the dragon will &ldquo;cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman&rdquo; (Rev. 12:15), verse 16 says, &ldquo;The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.&rdquo; The earth will open and swallow the armies sent by Satan. This means that during those three and a half years there will be many earthquakes. God will use these earthquakes to open the earth to swallow the armies sent by Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Woman Being Nourished in the Wilderness<br />
a Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.&rdquo; Verse 14 says that the woman will &ldquo;fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.&rdquo; After the rapture of the man-child, the woman will be left on earth to suffer persecution (v. 13). However, God will prepare a place to nourish her for &ldquo;a time and times and half a time,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a thousand two hundred and sixty days,&rdquo; the three and a half years of the great tribulation, after which, God will bring His people into the millennial kingdom. This is similar to the time when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel, and then God brought His people into the wilderness, where He nourished them, before bringing them into the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE TREADING OF JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>On the one hand, when Antichrist persecutes the Jews and forces them to discontinue their worship of God (13:7; Dan. 7:21; 8:11-12), he will seize control of Jerusalem. On the other hand, God will give Jerusalem over to him, allowing Antichrist to do whatever he desires to the city of Jerusalem. Thus, Jerusalem will be trampled: &ldquo;There was given to me a reed like a rod, and someone said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it. And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months&rdquo; (Rev. 11:1-2). A reed is for measuring (21:15; Ezek. 40:3, 5; 42:16-19), whereas a rod implies punishment (Prov. 10:13; Isa. 10:5; 11:4). Hence, <em>a reed like a rod</em> indicates measuring with punishment. To measure is to sanctify, to preserve, and to possess (Num. 35:2, 5; Ezek. 45:1-3; 42:15, 20; 48:8, 12, 15).</p>
<p>The apostle John was told to measure the temple of God and the altar. Undoubtedly, this is the temple and altar in heaven. This measuring indicates that heaven will be preserved from damage. During the three and a half years, heaven will be preserved because Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to the earth. After the man-child has been raptured to heaven, there will no longer be any place for Satan. Therefore, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, a devilish company, will be on earth doing everything possible to corrupt it. &ldquo;The court which is outside the temple&rdquo; will be cast out and not measured, because it will be given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months (Rev. 11:2). The holy city refers to the earthly Jerusalem (Isa. 52:1; Matt. 27:53).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE TESTIMONY OF THE TWO WITNESSES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Two Witnesses Being Moses and Elijah</h2>
<p>During the great tribulation, God will send His two witnesses to give testimony on the earth (Rev. 11:3-12). The Bible reveals that what these two witnesses do is just like the deeds of Moses and Elijah (vv. 5-6; Exo. 7:17, 19; 9:14; 11:1; 2 Kings 1:10-12; 1 Kings 17:1). Moses changed water into blood, and Elijah called down fire from heaven. Furthermore, Moses and Elijah appeared before the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-3). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (Luke 16:16), both testify for God. Therefore, the two witnesses of God must be Moses and Elijah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Two Olive Trees,<br />
the Two Lampstands, and the Two Sons of Oil Standing before the Lord of the Earth</h2>
<p>These two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, and the two sons of oil standing before the Lord of the earth (Rev. 11:4; Zech. 4:3, 11-12, 14). Revelation 11:4 says, &ldquo;These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.&rdquo; Olive trees produce oil for lamps, and lampstands give light with the oil of the olive trees. Therefore, Zechariah 4:14 says that they are &ldquo;the two sons of oil, who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo; The two witnesses are called the sons of oil because they are full of oil; they are full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Revelation 11:3 says, &ldquo;I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.&rdquo; The thousand two hundred and sixty days are the forty-two months in verse 2, which is the period of time that Antichrist blasphemes God (13:5-6) and persecutes God&rsquo;s people (12:6, 14). Because the persecution will be so severe, God will send Moses and Elijah who, being full of the Spirit, will speak for God and testify against the evil doings of Antichrist. At the same time, they will strengthen the Jews as well as the saints who are left in the great tribulation. While the two witnesses are strengthening God&rsquo;s people, an angel will fly in mid-heaven, preaching an eternal gospel (14:6). This gospel, which is different from the gospel of life and the gospel of the kingdom, will charge people to fear God and to worship Him, implying that they should not persecute His people and that they should not worship Antichrist.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Burning and Killing<br />
Those Who Desire to Harm Them;<br />
Having Authority to Shut Heaven,<br />
to Turn the Waters into Blood, and to Smite<br />
the Earth with Every Plague</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed. These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire&rdquo; (11:5-6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Killed by Antichrist,<br />
and Being Resurrected and Raptured</h2>
<p>In His wisdom, God will allow the two witnesses to be defeated temporarily. &ldquo;When they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them&rdquo; (v. 7). Antichrist will make war with the two witnesses and with the saints (13:7). Eventually, even the two strongest witnesses will be killed by the persecution under Antichrist. After these two witnesses are martyred, &ldquo;those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb. And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth. And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them. And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them&rdquo; (11:9-12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. A GREAT EARTHQUAKE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven&rdquo; (v. 13). The city refers to Jerusalem (v. 8). The tenth part of the city of Jerusalem will fall as a result of this earthquake, and the rest of the city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts at the last earthquake spoken of in 16:19. Literally, verse 13 of chapter 11 says that seven thousand names of men were killed in the earthquake. The phrase <em>names of men</em> implies people of renown. This will be seven thousand famous people. At that time, many among the nation of Israel will be people of renown. Seven thousand of them will be killed by this earthquake because they took the lead not to believe in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON</h2>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation, three unclean spirits out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will go forth to stir up the kings of the whole inhabited earth and to gather their forces (16:13-14), including the two hundred million horsemen spoken of in verses 14 through 16 of chapter 9, to the war at Armageddon. This will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. Satan&rsquo;s intention will be to destroy Israel (Zech. 14:2) and to fight against Christ and His army. For this he will use all of rebellious mankind (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-19). Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies (vv. 20-21; Micah 4:11-13; Zeph. 3:8; Zech. 14:3, 12-15; 12:4, 9) and will save the nation of Israel (vv. 3-8; 14:4-5; Joel 3:14-17). This is the treading of the great winepress of the fury of the wrath of God, as well as the judgment at the valley of Jehoshaphat prophesied by the prophet Joel in the Old Testament (Rev. 14:17-20; Isa. 63:1-6; Joel 3:9-13).</p>
<p>When the armies gather to attack Jerusalem, half of the city of Jerusalem will be brought into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city (Zech. 14:2). The feet of Christ &ldquo;will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley, so that half of the mountain will remove to the north and half of it to the south&rdquo; (v. 4). The remnant of the besieged Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah&rsquo;s mountains by the way opened to them by Jehovah (v. 5). In order to save His chosen elect and to judge evil mankind, God will also cause that day to have no light; the shining of the sun, the moon, and the stars will withdraw (v. 6). The people of Israel will see and look upon Christ whom they pierced, they will see Him coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and all the people and tribes will repent and mourn (Matt. 24:30; Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). They will also believe and receive Him. In this way, all Israel will be saved. After the Lord destroys the Gentile armies in the war at Armageddon in order to save the people of Israel, the three and a half years of the great tribulation will end. This age will also come to an end, and the age of the kingdom will begin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the man-child has been raptured to the throne of God, there will be war in heaven, and the dragon will be defeated and cast down to the earth. When the dragon sees that he has been cast to the earth, he will persecute the woman who brought forth the man-child. This will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The dragon will cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, but the earth will open its mouth and swallow the river. He will then make war with the rest of the woman&rsquo;s seed. The woman will be given the two wings of the great eagle to fly into the wilderness into her place, where she will be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</p>
<p>Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, a devilish company, will be on earth doing everything possible to corrupt it, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. However, God will send two witnesses, Moses and Elijah, to give testimony on the earth. The two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, and the two sons of oil standing before the Lord on the earth. They will be clothed in sackcloth and will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days. If anyone desires to harm them, fire will proceed out of their mouth and devour their enemies. In His wisdom God will allow these two witnesses to be temporarily defeated and killed. However, after three and a half days the breath of life out of God will enter into them, and they will stand on their feet, causing great fear to fall upon those beholding them. In that hour there will be a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city will fall. Seven thousand men will be killed in the earthquake, and the rest will become terrified and give glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation, three unclean spirits will go forth to stir up the kings of the whole inhabited earth and to gather their forces to the war at Armageddon. This will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. Satan will gather all rebellious mankind to destroy Israel. On that day, the feet of Christ will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives will split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley. Then the remnant of the besieged Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah&rsquo;s mountains by the way opened to them by Jehovah. They will see and look upon Christ whom they pierced; they will repent and mourn; and they will believe and receive Him. In this way, all the people of Israel will be saved. Furthermore, the Gentile armies will be destroyed, this age will come to an end, and the age of the kingdom will begin.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Throughout the centuries God&rsquo;s unique goal has been to join Himself to man and through that to destroy Satan. After Satan fell, God immediately pronounced His judgment on Satan. Satan was judged and sentenced to be cast into the lake of fire and perish there. Hence, God&rsquo;s children should have a strong enmity toward Satan, the devil, and should be clear concerning the destiny of Satan ordained by God so that, through their oneness with Christ, they might withstand all the works of the devil. In this lesson we will cover the prophecies concerning the end of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SATAN&rsquo;S FALL AND GOD PRONOUNCING<br />
HIS JUDGMENT OVER SATAN</h2>
<p>Before God created the earth, Satan was an angel created by God. From the day that Satan was created, he was perfect in his ways (Ezek. 28:15). He was even called &ldquo;Daystar, son of the dawn&rdquo; (Isa. 14:12). He was the cherub anointed to cover the Ark (Ezek. 28:14). However, his heart was lifted up (v. 17). He wanted to exalt himself to be equal with God and to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority and throne (Isa. 14:13-14). Thus, he rebelled against God.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s rebellion against God ushered in God&rsquo;s judgment upon him. Ezekiel 28 contains God&rsquo;s judgment on the rebellious Satan: &ldquo;You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I cast you to the ground; I presented you before kings that they may look at you. By the multitude of your iniquities in the unrighteousness of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I sent forth fire from your midst; it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all those who look at you&rdquo; (vv. 15-18). Isaiah 14:15 says, &ldquo;You will be brought down to Sheol, / To the uttermost parts of the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE EXECUTING OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT OVER SATAN</h2>
<p>At the time that Satan rebelled against God, God pronounced His judgment on him. However, God&rsquo;s judgment over Satan is being executed over a very long period of time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Church Age</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Jesus Being Manifested in the Flesh<br />
to Destroy the Works of the Devil</h2>
<p>First John 3:8 says, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.&rdquo; Satan, the devil, has sinned continually from ancient times, and he begets sinners so that they might practice sin with him. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on the cross in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), sin initiated by the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the devil (Heb. 2:14); and take away both sin and sins (1 John 3:5 and footnote 1, Recovery Version).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Lord Giving His Disciples Authority<br />
over All the Power of the Enemy, Satan</h2>
<p>When the Lord was ministering on the earth, He appointed seventy disciples and sent them out two by two into every city and place to spread His ministry. &ldquo;The seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name. And He said to them, I was watching Satan fall like lightning out of heaven&rdquo; (Luke 10:17-18). Not only so, the Lord also said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you&rdquo; (v. 19). Although the enemy has power, the Lord gave the disciples authority to subdue the power of the enemy. Serpents may signify Satan and his angels (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12), and scorpions may signify demons (Luke 10:17, 20). Through the authority given by the Lord, the disciples were able to subdue the evil power of Satan and execute the sentence God pronounced on him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Through His Death on the Cross, the Lord<br />
Destroying the Devil, Who Has the Might of Death</h2>
<p>Christ partook of blood and flesh and, through death, destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the devil (Heb. 2:14). To destroy is to bring to nought, to make of none effect, to do away with, to abolish, to annul, to discard. After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). In the fullness of the time, the Son of God came to become flesh (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3) by being born of a virgin (Gal. 4:4) so that He might destroy the devil in man&rsquo;s flesh through His death in the flesh on the cross.</p>
<p>Satan as the old serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), the ruler of this world, injected himself into man&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, yet He was without sin (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). Even though He was without sin in His flesh, He was still crucified in the flesh (Col. 1:22; 1 Pet. 3:18). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him (John 12:31; 16:11), thereby destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14). At the same time, through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man&rsquo;s flesh (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. God Crushing Satan<br />
under the Feet of the Church</h2>
<p>Romans 16:20 says, &ldquo;The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.&rdquo; In this verse God promises that He will crush Satan under the feet of those who live the church life, showing that the crushing of Satan is related to the church life. Dealing with Satan is not an individual matter; rather, it is a Body matter. Once there is a proper local church manifested as the practical expression of the Body, God is able to crush Satan under the feet of those in that local church, and they are able to experience the God of peace and enjoy the abundant grace of the Lord (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. At the End of This Age</h2>
<p>At the end of this age the judgment of Christ will come upon Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers (Rev. 19:11&mdash;20:3, 7-10). Antichrist is the man of lawlessness (2 Thes. 2:3) and the little horn (Dan. 7:8); the false prophet is the one who works with Antichrist. Antichrist, the false prophet, and Satan form a counterfeit trinity. Antichrist will be so enticing and attractive that he will have a great following, but all his followers will be destroyed along with him, the false prophet, and Satan. Christ will judge Antichrist and the false prophet by means of supernatural calamities: the earth will open, and they will fall directly into the lake of fire. They will not die, be buried, and then resurrect to face the judgment at the great white throne. They will be cast alive into the lake of fire. Satan, however, will be defeated, bound, and cast into the abyss.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Before the Great Tribulation, the Man-child Casting Satan out of Heaven to the Earth</h2>
<p>In Revelation 12 John saw &ldquo;a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems&rdquo; (v. 3). This great red dragon is &ldquo;called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth&rdquo; (v. 9). Before the great tribulation of three and a half years, the man-child, who is composed of the overcomers among God&rsquo;s people throughout the ages, will be resurrected and caught up to heaven (v. 5). Because of the rapture of the man-child, Michael and his angels will begin to war against Satan in heaven. The dragon and his angels will not be able to prevail, and thus, their place will no longer be found in heaven (vv. 7-8). Hence, Satan will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast down with him (v. 9). This will take place at the beginning of the fifth trumpet (9:1). When the fifth angel trumpets, a star out of heaven, which is Satan, will fall to the earth. At this point, a loud voice in heaven will say, &ldquo;Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night&rdquo; (12:10). When Satan is cast to the earth, the kingdom of God will come and so will our full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">2. At the End of the Great Tribulation,<br />
Antichrist and the False Prophet<br />
with Their Followers, Who Are One with Satan,<br />
Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation, after the Lamb marries the bride, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride, that is, the overcoming believers called to the marriage dinner, as His army to fight against Antichrist and the kings under him with their armies at Armageddon (19:11-21). There will be three enemies who continue to oppose the Lord: Satan, the dragon; Antichrist, the beast out of the sea; and the false prophet, the beast out of the land. Under the instigation of Antichrist, human beings will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Antichrist, the false prophet, and the ten kings and their armies (9:14-16; 16:12) will make war against the Lamb. The armies that are in heaven will follow Christ the Lamb on white horses; they will be dressed in fine linen, white and clean (19:14). The beast and the kings of the earth and their armies will gather together at Armageddon to make war with Him who sits on the white horse and with His army (v. 19). In this war Antichrist and his armies will be defeated, and the beast will be seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence did the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two will be cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone (v. 20). Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire earlier than Satan. They will be the first to perish in the lake of fire. The armies that follow them, however, will be &ldquo;killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse&rdquo; (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Satan Being Defeated and Cast into the Abyss</h2>
<p>After the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned so that the rebellious earth may be cleared up and the kingdom of Christ may come. The abyss is in the heart of the earth. Satan will be imprisoned there for a thousand years (20:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. After the Millennium</h2>
<p>During the millennium, the citizens on the earth will still have the rebellious nature of mankind, which will need to be exposed and purged. Furthermore, the dead unbelievers, death and Hades, and the demons will all need to be dealt with. After the thousand years, Satan will be released and used by the Lord to test rebellious mankind and to purge out the rebellious nature. After this, the dead unbelievers and the demons will be judged at the great white throne. Everything negative throughout the whole universe, including death and Hades, will be swept into the lake of fire so that the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem may come.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Satan Being Released from His Prison</h2>
<p>The abyss will only be a temporary prison for the devil. &ldquo;When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison&rdquo; (v. 7). Satan will be used as God&rsquo;s tool to test mankind for the last time.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Satan Deceiving the Nations<br />
to Rebel against God</h2>
<p>After Satan is released, he &ldquo;will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. Their number is like that of the sand of the sea&rdquo; (v. 8). The nations will go up &ldquo;upon the breadth of the earth&rdquo; and surround &ldquo;the camp of the saints and the beloved city&rdquo; (v. 9). This will be the last war on earth, the last rebellion of mankind. The rebellious nature within mankind will be exposed by Satan&rsquo;s last instigation and will be purged away by the Lord&rsquo;s final judgment on mankind.</p>
<p>According to Ezekiel 38:2, Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, which correspond with Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk. These places are &ldquo;the remotest parts of the north&rdquo; (v. 15; 39:2). Revelation 20:8 shows that Satan&rsquo;s deceiving of the nations that are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of Gog and Magog. This may indicate that in mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion against God, which will be instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead and the nations will follow.</p>
<p>In that last rebellion the nations will surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city. The camp of the saints is the lodging of the overcoming believers, who are the heavenly armies (19:14), camping on earth. The beloved city is the city of Jerusalem, the dwelling place of the remnant of Israel. In the millennium the overcoming believers and the remnant of Israel will be God&rsquo;s faithful people on earth, standing with God and for God. At the end of the millennium Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack God&rsquo;s faithful people on earth. However, fire will come down out of heaven and devour the rebels (20:9).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Satan Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>In the end &ldquo;the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever&rdquo; (v. 10). The lake of fire was prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). However, the beast and the false prophet, as well as the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; in Matthew 25:32-33 and 41, will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than the devil (Rev. 19:20). After the millennium of a thousand years, the devil also will be thrown into it. After the millennium the rebellious nature of mankind will have been thoroughly purged, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>The war at Armageddon will remove all the obstacles to the coming millennial kingdom. Christ and His bride will work together to cast all the dirty things in the universe into the lake of fire. God&rsquo;s sweeping in the universe began in Genesis 1. God swept the dirt first into the sea (v. 2), for at that time the sea was the &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; in this universe. Eventually, all the dirt will be put into the ultimate &ldquo;trash can,&rdquo; the lake of fire. In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.&rdquo; Since the goats followed the devil, they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for him and his angels. God prepared the lake of fire as a &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; to dispose of all the trash in the universe. Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the &ldquo;dust pan&rdquo; and then dumped into the lake of fire. After the millennium Satan will join them there. After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers, the demons, death, and Hades will also be cast into the lake of fire. Then there will be no more dust in the universe. There will be no dust in the New Jerusalem; there will be only gold, pearl, and precious stones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Satan was originally an angel created by God before He created the earth. From the day that Satan was created, he was perfect in his ways. However, he rebelled against God. Immediately after Satan rebelled against God, God pronounced His judgment on him. However, God&rsquo;s judgment over Satan is being executed over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>The Son of God was manifested to undo the works of the devil. Through His death on the cross, He destroyed the devil, who has the might of death. The Lord gave His disciples the authority over all the power of the enemy, Satan, for them to execute the sentence that God pronounced on him. Furthermore, once there is a proper local church manifested as the practical expression of the Body, God is able to crush Satan under the feet of the believers in that local church, and they are able to experience the God of peace and enjoy the abundant grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>At the end of this age, the judgment of Christ will come upon Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers. Antichrist, the false prophet, and Satan form a counterfeit trinity.

At the end of the great tribulation, Antichrist and the false prophet with their followers, who are one with Satan, will be cast into the lake of fire. After the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned so that the rebellious earth may be cleared up and the kingdom of Christ may come. The abyss is in the heart of the earth; Satan will be imprisoned there for a thousand years.</p>
<p>After the millennium Satan will be released from his prison and will deceive the nations to rebel against God and to surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city. However, fire will come down out of heaven and devour the rebellious ones. After this, Satan, the devil who deceives the nations, will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, which is where the beast and the false prophet are. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s children should have a strong enmity toward Satan, the devil, and should have a clear knowledge concerning the destiny of Satan ordained by God so that through their oneness with Christ, they might withstand all the works of the devil.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider the prophecies concerning the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>After the Lord deals with the believers, the Jews, the nations, and Antichrist with his followers, He will bring in the millennial kingdom. The word <em>millennium</em> means &ldquo;one thousand years.&rdquo; The millennium refers to the time between Christ&rsquo;s second coming as a King to rule the earth and the new heaven and new earth. This time will last for one thousand years. There are many verses in the Old Testament concerning the millennial kingdom (Psa. 2:6, 8-9; Isa. 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 65:20-25; 30:26; Zech. 8:20-23; Psa. 72:1-17; Isa. 4:2-6; 9:7; 12:1-5; 16:5; 32:1-2; 40:9-11; 61:4-9; Zech. 14:16-21). In the New Testament, the millennium is referred to in Revelation 20:4 and 6. These verses speak of those who reign with Christ for a thousand years.</p>
<p>The millennium will bring in the restoration of all things. Acts 3:21 says, &ldquo;Whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.&rdquo; The restoration will affect not only man but also the entire old creation&mdash;heaven, earth, the animals, and even the trees. Everything that was cursed through the fall of man will be restored. There are many prophecies in Isaiah, Zechariah, and the Psalms regarding the millennium bringing in restoration. Isaiah 30:26 says, &ldquo;The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, / On the day when Jehovah binds up the breach of His people / And heals the wound left from His stroke.&rdquo; This indicates that the sun and the moon will be restored to their original condition. Furthermore, all creatures will be restored to their original condition. The beast and the cattle will be restored to such an extent that &ldquo;the wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid&rdquo; (11:6). This will not be miraculous; rather, it will be normal and common. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.&rdquo; When Christ comes again, everything will be restored. The trees will flourish, and the flowers will blossom abundantly. According to 35:1-2, &ldquo;The wilderness and the desert will be glad; / And the desert will exult and blossom / Like the rose. / It will blossom and blossom, / And even exult with exultation and a ringing shout.&rdquo; Furthermore, &ldquo;water will break forth in the wilderness, / And streams in the desert. / And the desert mirage will become a pool, / And the thirsty ground, springs of water&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). Also, &ldquo;a highway will be there, and a way, / And it will be called, The Way of Holiness&rdquo; (v. 8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BEING THE LAST AGE IN GOD&rsquo;S OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>The millennium will be the last age in God&rsquo;s old creation. In order to understand this properly, we need to realize that the universe is composed of three periods. The first period was the time before the creation of Adam. No one can tell how long that period of time was. The second period extends from Genesis 1:2 through the end of the coming millennium. Following this second period, there will be a third period&mdash;the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem&mdash;that will last for eternity.</p>
<p>The second period of the universe is the period of accomplishment, the time during which God accomplishes His eternal purpose. This period of accomplishment began with the creation of man and will be completed at the end of the millennium. The second coming of the Lord Jesus will not end this period of accomplishment. The Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be a further step in the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose. The old heaven and the old earth will continue for another thousand years after the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Those one thousand years will be a continuation of the period of accomplishment. Therefore, God&rsquo;s accomplishment of His purpose began with the creation of man and will be completed at the end of the millennium, not at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p>The millennium will be the last and most crucial part of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Although the millennium will be wonderful, during that time the old heaven and the old earth will continue to exist. At most, the millennium will be a time of restoration. The old heaven and the old earth will be restored during the millennium, but they will not yet be changed from the old to the new. The changing of the old heaven and the old earth into the new heaven and the new earth will require a thousand years. Hence, the period of time from the creation of Adam until the second coming of Christ will issue in the restoration of the universe. However, to issue in the renewal of the universe will require another thousand years. After this last thousand years, the entire universe will be changed from the old to the new. Then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Between eternity past and eternity future, there are four dispensations: the dispensation before law, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom&mdash;the millennium. All four dispensations, including the millennium, belong to God&rsquo;s old creation, not to His new creation. The old creation is used by God to prepare the three kinds of people that He needs: the overcomers in the church to be the kings in the millennium, the saved Israelites to be the priests in the millennium, and the restored nations to be the people in the millennium. During the dispensation of the millennium, God will also continue to perfect the believers who were not willing to cooperate with God&rsquo;s sufficient grace to be perfected during the church age. Therefore, the millennial age will be used by God as an age of preparation.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BEING THE KINGDOM RECEIVED BY CHRIST<br />
FROM GOD THE FATHER</h2>
<p>Luke 19:12 and the first part of verse 15 indicate that the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father. It comprises the kingdom of Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13), which is the expectation of many devoted Israelites from the Old Testament to the time when Christ will come back to restore the nation of Israel, and the kingdom of Christ (Eph. 5:5), which is the expectation of the seeking believers in the New Testament age. Hence, the millennial kingdom will fulfill the desire of God, the desire of the devoted Israelites, and the desire of the seeking believers in the coming age of one thousand years. It will be the last age of God&rsquo;s old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. HAVING TWO SECTIONS</h2>
<p>The millennial kingdom will have two sections&mdash;the heavenly section and the earthly section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Heavenly Section</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Kingdom of the Father</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father. Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; The kingdom of the Father, as the heavenly part of the millennium, will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Composed of All the Old Testament<br />
and New Testament Overcomers</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 8:11: &ldquo;I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This word refers to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming Gentile believers will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and with all the other Old Testament overcomers. As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord (26:29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being the New Jerusalem in the Millennial Age</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will actually be the New Jerusalem in the millennial age. In Revelation 3:12 the Lord says, &ldquo;He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; This verse says that the overcomers will be pillars built into the temple of God. This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the overcomers. All the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers will be gathered together to be the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale in the millennium. As those who compose the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom, they will also compose the New Jerusalem in the coming age of the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being a Reward to All the Old Testament<br />
and New Testament Overcomers</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be a reward to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers (Heb. 11:26, 39-40). Verse 26 says that Moses esteemed &ldquo;the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the reward.&rdquo; Since Moses was willing to suffer the reproach of Christ, he will receive the reward of the kingdom. This reward will be given to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers, including Enoch, Abraham, David, and Paul. Whether or not we, the New Testament believers, will receive this reward depends on our enjoyment, experience, and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God. If we enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and express Christ, we will be among the overcomers and receive the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom as a reward.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Being the Realm<br />
for Christ and the Overcomers<br />
to Reign over the Nations and<br />
for the Overcomers to Be Priests of God and<br />
of Christ for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm in which Christ and the overcomers will reign over the nations. It will also be the realm in which the overcomers are priests of God and of Christ for one thousand years. The overcoming believers will reign in the millennial kingdom with Christ. Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&rdquo; Furthermore, the overcoming believers will rule over the nations. &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father&rdquo; (2:26-27). Reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom will be a reward to the overcomers. The overcomers will also be priests of Christ and of God. The overcomers &ldquo;will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years&rdquo; (20:6). In the millennium the overcomers will be priests to contact God and Christ and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations. As priests they will cause God and Christ to enjoy their service and be satisfied, and as kings they will bring God in His authority to man and represent God to shepherd man in order to bring enjoyment and satisfaction to man. Hence, the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the exercise of this priesthood and kingship.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Earthly Section</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Restored Kingdom of Israel&mdash;<br />
the Kingdom of David</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the restored kingdom of Israel&mdash;the kingdom of David (Acts 1:6; Mark 11:10). In the Old Testament the Lord promised the Jewish people that the Messiah, the anointed One, would come to inherit the throne of David and restore the Jewish nation, that is, the nation of Israel (Gen. 49:10; 2 Sam. 7:13, 16; Psa. 2:8-9; 72:1-20; 89:4; 110:2-3; Isa. 9:6-7; 11:1-5, 10; Jer. 23:5-6; 30:9; 33:14-17; Ezek. 21:27; 34:23-24; 37:24-25; Dan. 2:35; 7:14; Hosea 3:5; Amos 9:11-12; Zech. 3:8; 6:12-13; 9:9-10). When the Lord Jesus came the first time, the Jews were expecting the Messiah to restore His kingdom (Luke 2:25; 3:15; 7:19; John 1:41; 7:27, 41). However, it will not be until the Lord&rsquo;s second coming that He will restore the Messianic kingdom (Matt. 23:39). The kingdom that the Messiah will restore&mdash;the kingdom of Messiah or the kingdom of Israel to be restored in the future&mdash;will be the earthly part of the millennium, the tabernacle of David which the Lord will rebuild (Acts 15:16). The Lord will sit on the throne of David and reign over the house of Jacob, that is, the Jewish people (Luke 1:32-33), and He will rule over the nations of the earth during the millennium (Psa. 2:8; 72:8; Dan. 7:14; 2:35).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Realm<br />
for the Saved Jews to Be God&rsquo;s Priests<br />
to Teach the Nations in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm in which the saved Jews are God&rsquo;s priests to teach the nations (Zech. 8:20-23). Verse 23 says, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah of hosts, In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold, indeed, they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that during the millennium, every Jew will be a priest. Among the ancient Jews, the priests were the minority among the people of God. The people received teaching and instruction concerning God from the priests. The priests taught the people how to worship and serve God. That was a picture of the future situation in the earthly section of the coming millennial kingdom. During the millennium the converted Jews will be priests to the Gentiles. Ten Gentiles will come to one Jew, asking him to teach them how to serve the Lord. The Gentiles will hear that the Lord is with the Jews; hence, they will come to learn how to serve the Lord. This means that during the millennium the Gentiles will be the nations, and the converted Jews will be the priests, teaching the Gentiles to worship God (cf. lsns. 32&mdash;34).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being the Kingdom Prepared<br />
from the Foundation of the World<br />
for the Restored Nations in the Millennium</h2>
<p>In Matthew 25:34 the Lord revealed that the restored nations will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. This kingdom will be the earthly section of the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being the Realm for the Restored Nations<br />
to Be God&rsquo;s People in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the restored nations to be God&rsquo;s people. The converted Israelites will be the priests, leading the people to worship God. Around the Jews there will be the preserved, restored, and restituted nations in the earthly section of the millennium. Therefore, in the earthly section of the millennial kingdom the converted Jews will be the priests, and the nations, who will be restituted, restored, and preserved, will be the people. Creation will be restored, there will be no more war, and the earth will be full of peace. What a marvelous and glorious kingdom that will be!</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BEING THE KINGDOM DELIVERED<br />
BACK TO GOD THE FATHER<br />
AT THE END OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>At the end of the old creation, the kingdom will be delivered back to God the Father (1 Cor. 15:24-26). After the Lord has finished the work of purifying the restored nations and perfecting all the believers during the dispensation of the millennium, He will return the kingdom, which He received from the Father, to the Father. This will be the close of the old creation. Then the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come in. The restored and purified nations will be around the New Jerusalem as the people, and the New Jerusalem will be the eternal kingdom of God for God&rsquo;s manifestation and for the eternal enjoyment and experience of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:24 says, &ldquo;Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&rdquo; When Christ annuls Satan&rsquo;s authority, subdues all His enemies, abolishes death (vv. 25-26), and delivers up the kingdom to God the Father, that is, when all the negative things are done away with and the entire purpose of God is fulfilled, the old creation will come to its end. At the end of the millennium, the Lord will deliver up the kingdom to God.</p>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, Christ went to receive the kingdom from the Father (Luke 19:12, 15). Before the millennium Christ as the Son of Man will have received the kingdom from God, the Ancient of Days, for Him to rule all the nations for one thousand years (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 20:4, 6). At the end of the millennium, after the Lord has defeated Satan, the devil, and his evil angels, that is, all rule, authority, and power, and even death and Hades, putting all His enemies under His feet and casting all of them, including death and Hades, into the lake of fire (vv. 7-10, 14), He will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the Lord deals with the believers, the Jews, the nations, and Antichrist with his followers, He will bring in the millennial kingdom. The millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father. It comprises the kingdom of Messiah, which is the expectation of many devoted Israelites from the time of the Old Testament to the time when Christ will come back to restore the nation of Israel, and the kingdom of Christ, which is the expectation of the seeking believers in the New Testament age. The millennial kingdom will have two sections&mdash;the heavenly section and the earthly section. The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father. It will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. Hence, the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers, as the New Jerusalem in the millennial age, which is also a reward to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers. The overcomers will reign over the nations with Christ and will be priests of God and of Christ for one thousand years. The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the restored kingdom of Israel&mdash;the kingdom of David. It is the tabernacle of David which the Lord will rebuild. The saved Jews will be God&rsquo;s priests in the millennial kingdom to teach the nations how to worship and serve God. The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will also be the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world for the restored nations; they will be God&rsquo;s people in the millennial kingdom. In the millennium creation will be restored, there will be no more war, and the earth will be full of peace. After the Lord has finished the work of purifying the restored nations and perfecting all the believers during the dispensation of the millennium, He will return the kingdom, which He received from the Father, to the Father. This will be the close of the old creation. Then the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come in. The restored and purified nations will be the people around the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem will be the eternal kingdom of God for God&rsquo;s manifestation and for the eternal enjoyment and experience of God&rsquo;s people.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will cover the prophecies in the Bible concerning the new heaven and the new earth. There are only four verses in the Bible that explicitly speak of the new heaven and the new earth. Revelation 21:1 says, &ldquo;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.&rdquo; The other three verses are Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; and 2 Peter 3:13. Isaiah 65:17 says, &ldquo;I am now creating new heavens / And a new earth, / And the former things will not be remembered, / Nor will they come up in the heart.&rdquo; Isaiah 66:22 says that the new heavens and the new earth which Jehovah will make will remain before Him. Second Peter 3:13 says, &ldquo;According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.&rdquo; When the old heaven and the old earth pass away through fire and are renewed into the new heaven and the new earth (vv. 10-13), the New Jerusalem will descend to the new earth to be the eternal expression of the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE FIRST HEAVEN AND THE FIRST EARTH<br />
BEING RENEWED THROUGH THE JUDGMENT OF GOD<br />
BY THE PURGING OF BURNING FIRE<br />
AT THE CLOSE OF THE OLD CREATION<br />
TO BE THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</h2>
<p>The new heaven and the new earth will not be something other than the old heaven and the old earth. The new heaven and new earth will be the old heaven and old earth that are renewed to be the new heaven and new earth through the judgment of God by the purging of burning fire at the close of the old creation (vv. 10, 12). This may be compared to our old man and our new man. We are a new man, not another man, for the new man is the old man renewed. However, whereas we are renewed by the Lord&rsquo;s life, the old heaven and old earth will be renewed by the Lord&rsquo;s judgment with fire. The old universe will be burned, but it will not be burned to nothing; rather, this burning will be a purging, for out of this purging the new heaven and new earth will come forth.</p>
<p>Second Peter 3:10 says, &ldquo;The day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up.&rdquo; This will take place after the millennium (Rev. 20:7, 11). The word <em>roar</em> indicates a rushing sound or noise. This may be a proclamation of a great change in the universe from the old to the new. The elements refer to the physical elements of which the heavens are composed.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;burning with intense heat&rdquo; to dissolve the heavens and the earth will be the procedure that God will use to roll up the heavens and the earth and put them away so that they may be changed from the old to the new (Heb. 1:12). This will be God&rsquo;s final and consummate dealing with His creation in His government. In God&rsquo;s final dealing all the material things will pass away, but His eternal word will abide forever (Matt. 24:35; 1 Pet. 1:25). The word of His prophecy will remain and be fulfilled at His appointed time for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, regardless of the changes that occur in the physical universe.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BEING THE NEW UNIVERSE<br />
AS THE REALM OF GOD&rsquo;S RULING IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will be the new universe as the realm of God&rsquo;s ruling in eternity. Hence, it will be the realm for God to administrate His government for eternity. This divine administration is considered the eternal kingdom of God in which righteousness dwells forever with the New Jerusalem, the composition of all the redeemed of God, as the center.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING THE ISSUE OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S WORK OF THE NEW CREATION<br />
WITHIN THE OLD CREATION<br />
AND OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK OF RESTORATION<br />
IN THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will be the issue of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation and of God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation. God has two kinds of work in relation to the new heaven and new earth. His first work is the work of the new creation within the old creation. This is God&rsquo;s work upon His chosen ones, the believers in Christ. This work involves calling, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation and glorification. We were once the old creation, but God is working on us, making us a new creation. This is God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s other kind of work related to the new heaven and new earth is His work of restoration in the old creation. This is God&rsquo;s work to restore the unregenerated nations to be the people, the nations, in the new universe. Through these two kinds of work, God will have two kinds of peoples. The first kind will be the saints, the regenerated and transformed ones. The second kind will be those who are not regenerated and transformed. They will be the restored nations, that is, those who are restored to the original state of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Work of the New Creation<br />
in the Old Creation Producing the Regenerated, Transformed, and Perfected Saints<br />
to Be the Kings and Priests in the Center,<br />
the New Jerusalem, of the New Heaven<br />
and the New Earth</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation is to produce the regenerated, transformed, and perfected saints to be the kings and priests in the center, the New Jerusalem, of the new heaven and the new earth. There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation. God&rsquo;s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation possesses the divine life and the divine nature. Even though the old creation came into being through the mighty work of God, He does not reside in the old creation. For this reason, the first creation, the old creation, has no divine content. The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation. Hence, the old creation has become old.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work in this age, the age of grace, is the work of producing the new creation in the old creation. Through redemption, justification, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification God is making the new creation out of the old creation. Hence, we are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life. As God&rsquo;s new creation, we shall be the kings and priests in the new heaven and the new earth. We will serve God as priests, and we will reign as kings over the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Work of Restoration<br />
in the Old Creation<br />
Producing the Restored Nations to Be<br />
the People around the New Jerusalem<br />
on the New Earth</h2>
<p>The new heaven and the new earth also involve God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation to produce the restored nations to be the people around the New Jerusalem on the new earth (Rev. 21:24, 26). At His coming back, the Lord will judge the living. Some of the living ones will become the people on the new earth during the millennium. At the end of the millennium, some of these people will rebel, and God will judge them (20:8-9). The remnant of the living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the people of God, around the New Jerusalem. These nations will be restored and even redeemed, but they will not be regenerated. Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, God will have both the new creation and the restored part of the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING ITS CENTER</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will have the New Jerusalem as its center. After the coming forth of the new heaven and the new earth, the holy city&mdash;New Jerusalem&mdash;will descend to the new earth (21:1-2). This indicates that the dwelling place of God and His redeemed will not be in heaven but on the new earth. Furthermore, the restored nations, whose rebellious nature will have been completely purged, will become the nations on the new earth, dwelling around the New Jerusalem. In the new universe, the new heaven and new earth, God&rsquo;s focus will be on the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.</p><h2 class="head1">V. RIGHTEOUSNESS DWELLING IN IT</h2>
<p>Second Peter 3:13 says that there will be a new universe in which righteousness dwells. This indicates that everything in the new heaven and new earth will be altogether under God&rsquo;s government. Nothing will be wrong; nothing will be unjust or unrighteous.</p>
<p>Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God&rsquo;s governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation. Hence, in Peter&rsquo;s Epistles, which are concerned with God&rsquo;s government, righteousness is stressed repeatedly (1 Pet. 2:23-24; 3:12, 14, 18; 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:1; 2:5, 7-8, 21; 3:13). The main matter seen in John&rsquo;s writings is God&rsquo;s love expressed in His life; in Paul&rsquo;s writings, God&rsquo;s grace distributed in His economy; and in Peter&rsquo;s writings, God&rsquo;s righteousness maintained in His government. God&rsquo;s life, economy, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of these three apostles. Life is of love, economy is through grace, and government is based on righteousness. This righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth, saturating God&rsquo;s new universe prevailingly and thus maintaining it absolutely under God&rsquo;s righteous order.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. EXISTING FOR ETERNITY</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:8, Psalm 145:13, and Daniel 4:3 indicate that the new heaven and the new earth will exist for eternity. The new heaven and the new earth as the new realm for God&rsquo;s eternal administration will exist for eternity, just as God is eternal. This new heaven and new earth will last unto all the generations of the age of the ages without ending for God to carry out His eternal administration for His eternal manifestation and expression in the fullest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE YEARS, MONTHS, DAYS, AND NIGHTS<br />
BEING RULED BY THE SUN AND THE MOON</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will have years, months, days, and nights ruled by the sun and the moon (Rev. 22:2; cf. Gen. 1:16-18). The word <em>month</em> in Revelation 22:2 indicates that in the new heaven and the new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months. The sun will also be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each. In the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction (21:25; 22:5), for the light in the holy city will be the Triune God (21:23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. ITS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In eternity there will not only be the saved ones in the New Jerusalem and the perished ones in the lake of fire. There will also be a third category of people&mdash;those who are neither in the New Jerusalem nor in the lake of fire but outside the city. These will be the people on the new earth in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Restored Nations</h2>
<p>After the millennium a part of the nations on the earth who are deceived by the devil will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven (20:7-9). The rest of the nations will be transferred to the new earth as the nations to live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light (21:24). They will be the peoples spoken of in verses 3 and 4. As created but unregenerated human beings, they will be maintained to live forever in their created state by the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (22:2). Even to them there will be no more death (21:4). Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, neither will they be in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s People Who Do Not Have<br />
God&rsquo;s Life and Nature<br />
Being Different from the Sons of God</h2>
<p>The restored nations on the new earth will be the people of God, but they will not have God&rsquo;s life and nature. To God, His sons are one category and His people are another. In the new heaven and the new earth we will not be the people, the nations; we will be the sons. The sons of God in verse 7 are those who have been born of God through regeneration (John 1:12-13; 1 Pet. 1:3-4, 23; James 1:18); they are built together through transformation (1 Cor. 3:9-12; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-6; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23-24); and they will be glorified in full to be the corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:29-30; Heb. 2:10; Rev. 21:11). The nations outside the New Jerusalem will not be regenerated, transformed, or glorified.</p>
<p>Those who are regenerated, transformed, and glorified will be the components of the New Jerusalem. In eternity they will eat of the tree of life and drink the water of life (22:14, 17). The people, the restored nations, however, will not have this enjoyment. But they will have no more death, sorrow, crying, pain, or curse (21:4; 22:3). They will be sustained eternally by the leaves of the tree of life (v. 2). The people, therefore, will live on the new earth, outside the New Jerusalem, and enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and the new earth. The sons of God, on the contrary, will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb (v. 3), and reign for eternity (v. 5).</p><h2 class="head2">C. God, Who Dwells in the New Jerusalem<br />
as the Tabernacle, Being with Them</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.&rdquo; The peoples in this verse are not the sons of God but the restored nations. At that time there will be several peoples on the earth, and each corporate people will be a nation on the new earth. By that time their rebellious nature will have been purged away. As the purged and restored nations, these peoples will live outside the New Jerusalem. God will dwell with His peoples, but He will not dwell in them. God will dwell in the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle, and the peoples will be around the New Jerusalem. In this way God will dwell with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. God Wiping Away Their Tears; and<br />
Death, Sorrow, Crying, and Pain Being No More,<br />
for the Former Things Have Passed Away</h2>
<p>The restored nations will enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and new earth. These blessings are described in verse 4: &ldquo;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.&rdquo; In the new heaven and the new earth there will be no tears, no death, no sorrow, no crying, and no pain. Instead, there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears. Since death will be wholly swallowed up by life (1 Cor. 15:54) and cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14), in the new heaven and the new earth there will be no more death. Not only will death be cast into the lake of fire, but the elements of death&mdash;sorrow, crying, and pain&mdash;will be abolished.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Inhabiting the New Earth around the Holy City<br />
and Walking by the Light of the Holy City</h2>
<p>The restored nations will inhabit the new earth around the holy city. They will also walk by the light of the holy city (21:24). The glory of God will illumine the New Jerusalem, and its lamp will be the Lamb (v. 23). For this reason, the city will have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illumine it (22:5). God Himself will be the light and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city. This is the light in which the nations will walk.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Their Kings Bringing Their (the Kings&rsquo;)<br />
Glory into the Holy City</h2>
<p>The second half of Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; In this verse glory refers to splendor (Matt. 5:16; Heb. 2:9). The kings of the earth are the kings of the nations on the new earth. There will still be kings on the new earth, but they will be subordinate to the holy city. The fact that the kings will bring their glory into the New Jerusalem indicates that they will be subordinate to the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The People Bringing the Glory<br />
and Honor of the Nations into the Holy City</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:26 says, &ldquo;They will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.&rdquo; Once again, <em>glory</em> refers to splendor. <em>Honor</em> refers to preciousness in status and dignity in position (cf. Esth. 1:4). The people bringing the glory and honor of the nations into the holy city indicates that they will be subordinate to the sons of God, who will be reigning as kings in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Being Preserved by the Healing<br />
of the Leaves of the Tree of Life to Exist<br />
in the Created and Restored Human Life Forever</h2>
<p>The nations on the new earth will be preserved by the leaves of the tree of life to exist in the created and restored human life forever. Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the Bible leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers will eat of the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as the life and life supply inwardly, so that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity. The restored nations, on the contrary, will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and direction, so that they may live the created and restored human life forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The new heaven and the new earth will not be something other than the old heaven and the old earth but will be the old heaven and the old earth renewed to be the new heaven and the new earth through the judgment of God at the close of the old creation. By the judgment of God, the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up. This is the procedure that God will use to roll up the heavens and the earth and put them away so that they may be changed from the old to the new. All the material things will pass away, but His eternal word will abide forever.</p>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will be the new universe as the realm of God&rsquo;s ruling in eternity. It is the issue of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation and of God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation. Through these two kinds of work, God will have two kinds of peoples. The first kind will be the saints, the regenerated, transformed, and perfected saints to be the kings and priests in the center, the New Jerusalem, of the new heaven and new earth. The second kind, who will not be regenerated and transformed, will be the restored nations&mdash;those who are restored to the original state of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>After the coming forth of the new heaven and the new earth, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will descend to the new earth. Righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth and will saturate God&rsquo;s new universe to maintain it absolutely under God&rsquo;s righteous order. The new heaven and new earth will have years, months, days, and nights ruled by the sun and the moon. In the New Jerusalem, however, there will be no distinction between day and night, for the light in the holy city will be the Triune God Himself. The restored nations on the new earth will be the people of God, but they will not have God&rsquo;s life and nature. God, who dwells in the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle, will be with them. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death, sorrow, crying, and pain will be no more. They will be sustained eternally by the leaves of the tree of life to live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and direction, so that they may live the created and restored human life and share the common blessings in the new heaven and the new earth forever.</p>
