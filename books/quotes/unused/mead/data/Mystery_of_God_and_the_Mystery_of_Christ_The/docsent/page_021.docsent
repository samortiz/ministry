   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ, which is the Body of this universal man, is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Body of Christ is simply the enlargement of Christ, Christ increased.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 2, after Adam had been created, God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart v. 18 . Then God brought all the animals and birds before him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As each of the living things created by God were brought before Adam, he looked at them and gave each one a proper name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not, however, find a counterpart among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then God put Adam to sleep, opened up his side, took a rib out of him, and made a woman for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the little piece that God took out of Adam, He made a bride, a wife for Adam and declared that this wife would be one flesh, one body, with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Adam awoke, he said, This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh; / This one shall be called Woman / Because out of Man this one was taken v. 23 . Then the two became one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Originally there was just one bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually there was a couple Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What was Eve?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Adam s wife, she was the fullness of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve was something taken out of Adam and was the same as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She was the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, the church is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is something that has come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, the church is exactly the same as Christ nothing more, nothing less, and nothing different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I once attended a meeting in my native city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While we were in that meeting, fellowshipping in a free way, an elderly brother came into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he entered, another brother said, Brother So-and-so just came in. When he said this, the elderly brother answered, No, just half came in. When he said this, everyone wondered what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then his wife came into the meeting, and he said, Now the other half is here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our physical body is another illustration of the relationship between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today experts are able to make artificial limbs for people who have lost an arm or a leg.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, is an artificial limb a real member of a person s body?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not, because it is not something that comes out of the person but has been added.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is something foreign to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An artificial limb does not grow out of a person s body but is something that is fitted on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, it is not the same as the person who wears it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A genuine part of the body has blood flowing to it, but an artificial part does not.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My nose, arms, and ears are exactly the same as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blood in all of my members is the same as the blood that is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fact, it is not only the same as my blood, it is my blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These physical illustrations should help us to realize what the church is to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is the Body of Christ, the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is something that has come out of Christ and is exactly the same as Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST HIMSELF Expressing Meekness Versus</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Expressing Christ as Meekness</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these days many dear children of God have been enlightened by the Lord and are seeking the church life, the real expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, we should consider, what is the real church life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people would say that we have the real church life when everyone is humble, gentle, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This, however, is not the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In China and India there are quite a number of people who live together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They love each other and are so humble and meek, and as a result, their living is very attractive to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You would be surprised at how nice they are to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, they do not know God and they do not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of them even worship idols and images.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is no doubt that the genuine church life is full of love, humility, gentleness, and meekness, but the genuine church life is more than simply loving each other.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The real church life is the life of Christ; the real church life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the humility, gentleness, and meekness in the church life must be the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not enough merely to have humility, gentleness, and meekness; we must have the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How then can we tell the difference between Christ as meekness and meekness that is apart from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Allow me to illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1947 I returned from Shanghai to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I arrived there, the responsible brothers came to the station to meet me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the way from the station to the meeting hall they said, Oh, Brother Lee, there is a sister among us who came from such and such a place who is very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The brothers did not realize it, but I already knew this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before she had come to Nanking, she had gone to Shanghai and had stayed there for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the brothers finished telling me about this sister, I asked them what they meant when they said that she was so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They replied, We have never seen a person who is as meek and gentle as she is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because these brothers were very good brothers and I was very familiar with them, we could talk frankly and freely, so I said, Brothers, if this is the sign of spirituality, then the statue of Mary in front of the Catholic church is more spiritual than this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Look at that statue.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How meek and gentle it is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This statue will never become angry with you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Regardless of what you do to it, it will continue to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a person has Christ as his meekness, his main characteristic is not meekness or gentleness but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is meek and gentle, but neither of these is his main characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His main characteristic is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you meet him, you sense the fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not the case with those whose meekness is not Christ as meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, those whose meekness is not Christ will always be conscious of their meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They may have an outward expression of meekness, but inwardly they are saying, Look at how meek I am.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you have this kind of meekness, gentleness, and love, it is you who are meek, gentle, and loving, not Christ; Christ has not become meekness to you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If Christ is meekness within you, you will be very meek, but you will have no consciousness that you are being meek.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you were to hear others saying of you, This person is so meek, you would think that they were speaking of someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You will have no sense that you are meek.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the same way, when Christ is love to you and you love others through this love, you will not feel that you are a person who loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You will simply love them without feeling or sensing that you are doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you feel that you are loving others, this is not Christ; it is you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When Moses face was shining, others saw this, but he did not.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When Christ is truly manifested through us as meekness, gentleness, or love, we will not be conscious of this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In addition, our main characteristic will not be any of these things but will be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to realize that it is one thing to be good or gentle and another thing to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The church life is not a life of goodness, meekness, gentleness, or love; the church life is a life of living out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The members of the Body of Christ are not members of love but of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are not simply filled with love; we are filled with Christ as love.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To express love itself is something of our natural man, but to express Christ as love is something of the spiritual new man, which is the increase and enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the real church life.</S>
