<h2 class="head1">SOME SERVICE IN NAN-PING</h2><p>I came to Nan-Ping two weeks ago to clear up some matters and to lead the brothers and sisters to know God in the way of inward life and outward service. Thank God for His co-working. I saw God's presence, and the brothers and sisters were all moved to rise up to learn to serve.</p><p>We have now divided the services into gospel visitation, ushering, and cleaning. In the area of cleaning, many sisters are beginning to come to the meeting hall to scrub floors and benches and to wash windows. They are all living and joyful, and they clean the floors and benches well. I truly thank God for His mercy.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Huang Guo-bin<br />May 6, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">A REPORT OF A FELLOWSHIP MEETING</h2><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:25; 13:17; 1 Pet. 5:5-6; 1 Cor. 15:58</h1><p>Our fellowship meeting tonight is a special gathering because there have recently been some new arrangements and decisions made regarding the work and business affairs of the church. We want to explain these matters to the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head2">The New Arrangement of the District Meetings</h2><p>The first thing we want to talk about is the new arrangement of the district meetings. We began the district meetings in May of last year, but now we have made some new arrangements. We have given each brother and sister a letter telling which district meeting to attend. You cannot freely choose. If you are truly inconvenienced geographically, you can ask the business office to change your assignment, but please do not make any change yourself.</p><p>The reasons for this restriction are as follows: 1) The size of each district meeting place is different, so we must arrange the number of people according to the number of seats that are available. Nevertheless, some places have been over-assigned. Of course, there will always be some who cannot attend some meetings for personal reasons. We believe that these places generally will be able to handle everyone. 2) There are 1,500 to 1,600 people in Shanghai divided into fifteen district meetings. If we do not designate who meets where, we will not know who has attended the meetings and who has not. 3) We want to render the brothers and sisters practical help. We want them to receive practical fellowship and visitation. If we do not designate their meeting place, it will be difficult to achieve these goals. We have considered this matter very much.</p><h2 class="head2">Combined Meetings and District Meetings</h2><p>The second point is the combined meetings. We can say there are two kinds of meetings now: combined meetings and district meetings. There will be two combined meetings a week. One will be at ten o'clock on the Lord's Day morning. The first Lord's Day of every month will be a gospel meeting. The rest of the times will be for edification. Another meeting will be the fellowship meeting every Saturday night. These two meetings will be in the first district at Wen-teh Lane. There will be three district meetings a week: the table meeting on the Lord's Day evening, the Tuesday night prayer meeting, and the Friday night meeting for new believers. These will be held in the fifteen different districts. There will also be a Wednesday night gospel meeting which will be held in four districts.</p><p>The gospel meeting is the meeting in which all the brothers and sisters must work. It is a meeting to work on others. The edification meeting is one in which a person is edified himself. In the fellowship meeting, one is either helped or is helping others. The table meeting is directed towards the Lord. The prayer meeting is where we come before God to work. It is the responsibility of every brother and sister to bring others to hear the gospel. We hope that every brother and sister can bring at least two people to the Lord in a year. It would be best if each one can lead five to the Lord. We hope that the brothers and sisters will bring their friends to hear the gospel at the Wednesday night gospel meeting in the district that is closest to them. The gospel meeting in the first district is especially important; it is a combined meeting of eight districts together. All the brothers and sisters have to bring their friends to fill up this place.</p><p>The meeting for the new believers will be a message meeting for those who have just believed in the Lord. The word to the new believers is very basic in nature. There are about fifty topics. We hope we can cover them all within a year. We invite all the brothers and sisters to come because, even if you have heard these messages before, you have not completely apprehended them. We hope that every brother and sister would receive this basic edification. Our requirements for this meeting are stricter. Please attend it in the district to which you have been assigned. If you fail to attend these meetings, you will bring trouble on yourself because somebody will come to visit you and make the lesson up for you. No meeting will be more closely monitored than this one. Therefore, if you want to avoid trouble, it would be best if you attended every one of these meetings.</p>
