[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD
[2]  The divine revelation in the Scriptures is progressive, unfolding and developing book by book and chapter by chapter.
[3]  The sixty-six books of the Bible were written over a period of approximately sixteen hundred years.
[4]  In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was made a minister according to the economy of God to complete the word of God.
[5]  Another contrast between Genesis and Exodus is seen in the matter of the Lord s care for His people.
[6]  After Abraham was called, he began to follow the Lord.
[7]  We know, of course, in a general way that the Lord supplied Abraham with all he needed, but in Genesis we do not have the same kind of specific instances showing the Lord s direct care for Abraham as we have in Exodus showing His care for His people.
[8]  Although the book of Genesis is rich, in this book we do not see God s glory manifested among His people in a substantial way.
[9]  However, in chapter forty of Exodus, the glory of God came down visibly and substantially when the tabernacle was erected.
[10]  Not only did the glory of God come down upon the tabernacle, but it also filled it.
[11]  As far as composition is concerned, the book of Exodus is a continuation of Genesis.
[12]  This is proved by the way Exodus begins: Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, which came into Egypt 1:1, Heb .
[13]  Genesis has a wonderful beginning but a poor conclusion.
[14]  It opens with the words, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth Heb .
[15]  PHARAOH S ENSLAVEMENT OF ISRAEL A. Pharaoh Typifying Satan
[16]  The children of Israel were under the enslavement of Pharaoh 1:8-11, 13-14 , who typifies Satan, the ruler of the world John 12:31; Eph 2:2 .
[17]  Because Pharaoh is the embodiment of Satan, he is a picture of Satan in Exodus, a book of pictures.
[18]  B. Pharaoh Making God s People Work for Him 1.
[19]  OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL A. Killing the Males and Keeping the Females
[20]  Pharaoh not only enslaved the children of Israel, but also sought to kill all the baby boys born to the Hebrew women 1:15-19 .
[21]  What Pharaoh did in Egypt is exactly what Satan is doing today: Satan is killing the life that is for God s purpose and preserving the life that is for man s pleasure.
[22]  As believers in Christ, even we ourselves may be used by Satan to kill the male life, the life for God s purpose, and to preserve the female life, the life for man s pleasure.
[23]  If we do not have the Lord s grace, daily we shall be a Pharaoh killing the life for God s purpose and keeping the life for man s pleasure.
[24]  GOD S SOVEREIGNTY A. Causing the Children of Israel to Multiply
[25]  Although Pharaoh enslaved the children of Israel and tried his best to slaughter the male life, God was still sovereign over the whole situation 1:7, 12, 17-21 .
[26]  For example, it was of God s sovereignty that the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew strong exceedingly 1:7, Heb .
[27]  In chapter one of Exodus Pharaoh held the children of Israel in slavery and also sought to kill all the baby boys born to Hebrew mothers.
[28]  In the second chapter we see the preparation of a savior for the children of Israel.
[29]  Although these two chapters are separate, there is an underlying theme that binds them together.
[30]  This theme is that in times of crisis God uses the female life for His purpose.
[31]  For example, in Exodus 1 God used the midwives, the female life, to preserve the male life for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[32]  When Pharaoh s daughter saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her female slave to fetch it v. 5, Heb . Here we see the part played by a female slave.
[33]  This slave is the third female mentioned in this chapter.
[34]  Again the name is not given in order to underscore God s intention of impressing us with the female life.
[35]  THROUGH BEING REJECTED BY THE BROTHERS A. Endeavoring to Rescue His Brothers
[36]  Acts 7:23 says, But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.
[37]  In the Bible the number forty signifies trials, tests, and sufferings.
[38]  The children of Israel were tested by God in the wilderness for forty years, Moses was on the mountain for forty days, and the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days.
[39]  Hebrews 11:24 says, By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh s daughter.
[40]  Some historians believe that if Moses had remained in the Egyptian palace, he would have been the heir to the throne.
[41]  Nevertheless, he renounced a royal position in Egypt, the highest rank in the world at that time.
[42]  Hebrews 11:25 and 26 continue, Choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked away to the reward.
[43]  The Hebrew males who rejected Moses were all immature and inexperienced.
[44]  But in the priest of Midian we see a mature, experienced, male life that received the vessel which had been raised up by God.
[45]  In this chapter all the females are positive, but the males are of two categories, ones with the rejecting life and the positive one with the receiving life.
[46]  The book of Exodus reveals the kind of people God can use in His economy for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[47]  If the children of Israel were to enjoy the good land and to fulfill God s purpose of building a temple as God s testimony on earth, they had to fight to deliver the land from the usurping hand of the enemy.
[48]  Just as the head of every man is Christ, so the head of the woman is the man 1 Cor 11:3 .
[49]  On the one hand, Christ is under the headship of God, and, on the other hand, He is the head over every man.
[50]  If a woman lives an independent life, she becomes a real male.
[51]  In the Bible God s people are likened to a female.
[52]  In the Old Testament God told His people that He was their husband and that they were His spouse.
[53]  Even King David, a mighty warrior, was part of this corporate wife.
[54]  David was not the husband of the children of Israel; God was.
[55]  Whenever the Israelites rebelled against God, they assumed the position of the husband, and it was as if they divorced themselves from God.
[56]  In chapter one of Exodus we saw the children of Israel under slavery, and in chapter two we saw the preparation of a savior.
[57]  Exodus 3:1 says, Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
[58]  One day Moses led the flock to the back side of the desert.
[59]  This indicates that we can be called only when we are at the back side of our situation, never when we are at the front.
[60]  It is of vital importance that the one who is called know the name of the One who is calling him.
[61]  Exodus 3 reveals the name of God, the calling One, in a full way, more fully perhaps than any other portion of the Word.
[62]  The Hebrew word for God is Elohim, which means the mighty One who is faithful in His oath.
[63]  If we would be called by the Lord, we must realize that He is mighty and faithful, mighty to do everything for us and faithful to keep His word.
[64]  The phrase the God of thy father denotes history with God.
[65]  To say that God is the God of our father does not mean that He is the God of our father in the flesh, for our natural father may not be a child of God.
[66]  In the foregoing message we covered four aspects of God s calling of the prepared one: the motivation of God s calling, the time of God s calling, the place of God s calling, and the calling One.
[67]  Negatively, God called him to deliver the children of Israel out of the tyranny of the Egyptians.
[68]  God spent another forty years to bring this capable yet disappointed man to the end. It is not an easy matter to terminate such a person.
[69]  It took forty years of discipline to make Moses realize that he was not qualified to deliver God s people out of Egypt and to bring them into the good land.
[70]  Moses also had to realize his inability 4:10-13 .
[71]  He came to fully realize that in himself he was not the right person to answer God s call.
[72]  Perhaps during the forty years in the wilderness he even experienced failure in shepherding the flock.
[73]  We have seen that the thorn-bush in Exodus 3 is a symbol of Moses as God s called one.
[74]  Although Moses had been rejected by man, he was accepted by God, and the fire of God s glory burned within him and upon him.
[75]  Therefore, Moses was a thorn-bush burning with the glory of God.
[76]  In Exodus 3 the cursed thorn becomes the vessel of God, and the flame of fire becomes one with the thorn-bush.
[77]  Through redemption, signified by the lamb slain and offered to God for fallen man Gen 4:4 , the curse has been taken away, and the fire has become one with the thorn.
[78]  The children of Israel were a corporate thorn-bush.
[79]  As such a thorn-bush, they were redeemed 13:14-16 , sanctified 13:2 , transformed, and built up.
[80]  But something happened in a prayer meeting in Shanghai in the early 1940s that helped me to see God s people as He sees them.
[81]  We have seen that the record of the call of Moses is the most complete record in the Bible pertaining to God s calling.
[82]  When Moses came to the back side of the desert and met God there, he beheld the sign of a thorn-bush that burned without being consumed.
[83]  Although this sign was marvelous, it was somewhat objective.
[84]  I. A ROD BECOMING A SERPENT A. The Rod Signifying What We Rely Upon
[85]  When God called Moses, Moses had a rod that he relied upon.
[86]  Perhaps when he was talking to God, Moses, an elderly man, was leaning upon that rod.
[87]  Moses was reluctant to accept God s calling; he protested that the children of Israel would reject him and say that the Lord had not appeared to him.
[88]  THE HAND BECOMING LEPROUS A. By Being Put into the Bosom
[89]  In verse 6 the Lord told Moses to put his hand into his bosom.
[90]  Moses may have thought that by putting his hand into his bosom, he would find a pearl, a diamond, or some precious treasure.
[91]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINE THE MALE HELP AND THE FEMALE HELP
[92]  With Christians today we rarely see this kind of matching.
[93]  There is very little coordination between Christian workers because they lack the vision of the principle of the Body.
[94]  I am burdened that we all, as God s called ones, see the need of such a match.
[95]  ZIPPORAH S CUTTING A. To Complete Circumcision in Moses Family
[96]  We come now to the record regarding Moses and Zipporah 4:24-26 .
[97]  Verse 24 says, And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.
[98]  The first sign is that of the rod becoming the serpent.
[99]  Do not think, as many do, that Moses is vastly superior to us.
[100]  Most Christians regard Moses as the highest servant of God in the Old Testament and Paul as the highest in the New Testament.
[101]  According to 3:18, Moses and the elders of Israel were to say to the king of Egypt, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.
[102]  If we could bring people out of the tyranny of the world into the wilderness and take them to the mountain where they see the revelation of God s economy and eventually build a tabernacle for God, we would surely be satisfied.
[103]  However, with the tabernacle we do not yet have the solid building, which is signified by the temple in the land of Canaan.
[104]  Hence, if we would reach the ultimate goal of God s calling, we must journey onward and enter into the good land.
[105]  By the types we see that in order to be on the mountain to receive God s revelation and in order to build the tabernacle as God s temporary dwelling place, all we need to do is enjoy Christ as the lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the living water.
[106]  In this message we shall consider the three stations in the fulfilling of God s purpose as they are mentioned in Exodus 3.
[107]  In God s call the chosen people were directed to three different stations.
[108]  In verse 12 the Lord said to Moses, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
[109]  The second station is the mountain 3:12; 19:1-2, 11; 24:16-18 , where the children of Israel received revelation concerning God and concerning the tabernacle.
[110]  For hundreds of years they had been under darkness in Egypt where there was no light, no word, and no speaking of God.
[111]  But now, under the enlightenment, they were to live according to the revelation concerning God, and they were to build the tabernacle according to the pattern revealed by God.
[112]  Because the tabernacle is merely the temporary dwelling place of God, we should not be satisfied with the church life in this stage.
[113]  We need to press on to the stage represented by the temple in the good land.
[114]  After the children of Israel entered into the good land by crossing the Jordan, they were circumcised; that is, their flesh was cut off Josh 5:2-4 .
[115]  Thus, the self was buried in the river, and the flesh was cut off by circumcision.
[116]  The church life with Christ helps us both to bury the self and to cut off the flesh.
[117]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTEEN GOD S DEMAND AND PHARAOH S RESISTANCE 1
[118]  God s demand and Pharaoh s resistance issued in a number of conflicts, which are recorded in chapters five through fourteen of Exodus.
[119]  Exodus 5:1 says, And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness Heb .
[120]  Jehovah also demanded that Pharaoh allow the children of Israel to sacrifice to Jehovah their God v. 3 . Sacrifice is a word parallel to feasting.
[121]  To the children of Israel, the feast was a feast, but to God it was a sacrifice.
[122]  Increasing Their Labor with Rigor a. Giving Them No More Straw
[123]  In verse 7 Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and the officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
[124]  Instead of letting Israel go, Pharaoh actually increased their labor with rigor.
[125]  When God is about to rescue a certain person from today s world, Satan takes away that person s straw ; that is, he deprives him of the supply from the world.
[126]  Now we come to the issue of the conflict caused by God s demand and Pharaoh s resistance.
[127]  The first aspect of the issue was that Israel suffered more cruelty 5:10-21 .
[128]  Actually, it is a positive sign, for it indicates that God s negotiation with the enemy is taking place and that we are affected by it.
[129]  After the first conflict between God and Pharaoh, Moses, who was God's representative, was troubled and discouraged 5:22-23 .
[130]  In 6:1-8 God gave Moses a strong word concerning His name and His covenant.
[131]  Because we are still short of the experience of God's name and of the true realization of God's covenant, we need to consider these matters in this message.
[132]  In Genesis 12 God made a promise to Abraham.
[133]  After the first conflict with Pharaoh, Moses felt that he had failed.
[134]  Hence, in this message we begin with God s word of assurance.
[135]  Moses was also trained in relation to the children of Israel s unbelief 6:9, 12 .
[136]  When I studied the history of Israel many years ago, I did not have much appreciation of the children of Israel.
[137]  This ordination is related to the genealogy in 6:16-25.
[138]  For a long time, I could not understand why this genealogy is included here.
[139]  The book of Exodus is a book of pictures, not a book of philosophy.
[140]  The pictures in the first part of Exodus present a portrait of life in the world under Satan s usurpation.
[141]  By means of these pictures the nature of such a life is exposed.
[142]  The pictures in this book also unveil the desire of God s heart with respect to His chosen people.
[143]  Let us now consider the second conflict between Jehovah and Pharaoh 7:8-14 .
[144]  Exodus 7:10 says, And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent Heb .
[145]  I doubt that Pharaoh and his servants realized that the significance of this miracle was to expose the fact that their life was a life under Satan s usurping hand, that their living in Egypt was under the Devil s usurpation and possession.
[146]  THE THIRD CONFLICT A. The Time and the Place
[147]  This conflict took place in the morning by the brink of the river Nile 7:15 .
[148]  The book of Exodus reveals that God desires to rescue His people from everything other than Himself, that He wants to deliver them from everything that is not God.
[149]  After the exodus from Egypt, God s people saw a heavenly vision by which they came to know God Himself and, in addition, to know the kind of living that is in accordance with God.
[150]  God longs to rescue His chosen people from every form of usurpation and preoccupation so that they may have nothing besides God Himself.
[151]  In the fourth conflict with Pharaoh, the Lord smote all the borders of Egypt with frogs 8:2 .
[152]  V. THE FIFTH CONFLICT A. On God s Side
[153]  In the fifth conflict, the Lord said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt 8:16 .
[154]  When Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth, it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt v. 17 . Formerly, the dust of Egypt produced grain that could be used for food.
[155]  But in this plague the dust became lice that caused great discomfort to the Egyptians.
[156]  If we would grasp the revelation in the book of Exodus, we need to see that God desires His people to build a dwelling place for Him on earth.
[157]  But God s enemy has usurped His people and holds them in bondage in the world.
[158]  Therefore, in the first fourteen chapters of Exodus, there was a struggle between God and Pharaoh, the representative of Satan.
[159]  In this struggle God s judgment upon the Egyptian world was made manifest through the ten plagues.
[160]  However, the plagues were not only a punishment, but also God s way of exposing the nature, the meaning, and the issue of the life of the world, the life which occupied the people of God.
[161]  In the sixth conflict between the Lord and Pharaoh, the Lord sent upon Pharaoh and all the Egyptians swarms of flies 8:20-32 .
[162]  It is difficult to determine what kind of flies these were.
[163]  In the sixth plague, which took place during the eighth conflict 9:8-12 , boils broke forth upon man and beast.
[164]  The Lord told Moses and Aaron to take handfuls of ashes from the furnace and to sprinkle them toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
[165]  In 9:13 10:29 we come to the third group of plagues.
[166]  Like the first two groups, this group also is composed of three plagues.
[167]  We have seen that God used the first six plagues to expose the actual condition of the water, the earth, and the air, all of which are necessary for man s livelihood.
[168]  As we shall now see, in the third group of plagues God altered some of the principles that govern the functions of the universe.
[169]  In Genesis 1 and 2 God restored the universe which had been judged because of Satan s rebellion.
[170]  In the ninth plague He went on to change the function of the sun 10:21-29 .
[171]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY PHARAOH S SUBTLE BARGAINING
[172]  Before we go on to consider the final conflict between God and Pharaoh, we need to consider Pharaoh s subtle bargaining.
[173]  Pharaoh signifies not only Satan, but also the self and the natural man.
[174]  In addition, our relatives or friends can also be a Pharaoh to us today.
[175]  Furthermore, our natural mind, will, or emotion may be a Pharaoh who rebels against God or who bargains subtly with Him.
[176]  PHARAOH S SUBTLE BARGAINING A. Rejecting God s Demand
[177]  At first Pharaoh rejected God s demand and said, Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?
[178]  I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go 5:2, Heb .
[179]  C. Offering to Let Israel Go a Short Distance
[180]  In the third stage of his subtle bargaining, Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away 8:28, Heb .
[181]  If the children of Israel had agreed not to go very far away, Pharaoh could have reached them whenever he wanted them.
[182]  Sometimes today s Pharaohs will allow us to believe in the Lord Jesus, just as long as we do not go to what they regard as an extreme.
[183]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE HARDENING OF PHARAOH S HEART
[184]  In this message we come to a very difficult matter: the hardening of Pharaoh s heart.
[185]  The argument concerning this is related to whether God hardened Pharaoh s heart or Pharaoh hardened his own heart.
[186]  In 4:21 God says, I will harden his heart.
[187]  God s sovereignty and mercy are both divine and eternal, without beginning or ending.
[188]  Man s free will, on the contrary, is something created by God.
[189]  In this message we come to the last conflict between God and Pharaoh.
[190]  This conflict issued in the tenth plague, the slaughter of the firstborn 11:1-10; 12:29-36 .
[191]  Pharaoh s stubbornness forced God to slaughter the firstborn.
[192]  Especially in ancient times, the firstborn represented the strong one and the most lovable one.
[193]  When I was young, I disagreed with God regarding the slaughter of the firstborn.
[194]  God s revelation in the Bible is presented in a practical way, not in the way of doctrinal understanding.
[195]  Because the divine revelation comes in a practical way, it is always living.
[196]  However, if it were given in a way of doctrine, the result would be death.
[197]  The time of the Passover is related to a certain month and a certain date.
[198]  The Hebrew people had two calendars, a sacred calendar and a civil calendar.
[199]  The civil calendar was common, whereas the sacred calendar was related to the experience of God s salvation.
[200]  As God s redeemed ones, we have had two births, two beginnings: a physical birth with a physical beginning and a spiritual birth with a spiritual beginning.
[201]  THE LAMB OF THE PASSOVER A. For the Unit of a House
[202]  In 12:3 the children of Israel were commanded to take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house.
[203]  The crucial point here is that the Passover lamb was not for every individual, but for every house.
[204]  In Luke 19, the Lord Jesus said to Zaccheus the publican, Today salvation has come to this house v. 9 . According to Acts 11:14, the promise was made to Cornelius that he and all his house would be saved v. 14 . Furthermore, when the jailer asked what he must do to be saved, Paul and Silas told him, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household Acts 16:30-31 . These cases indicate that the unit of God s salvation is the house, not the individual.
[205]  Speaking of the Passover lamb, 12:6 says, The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
[206]  He was killed by the congregation of God s people.
[207]  Nowhere else in the Scriptures do we find such a detailed account of Christ s redemption.
[208]  The reason for all the detail is that God wants us to know the redemption of Christ in such a thorough way that we could never forget it.
[209]  This indicates that it is God s intention that we neither neglect the redemption of Christ nor forget it.
[210]  B. To Touch the Lintel and the Two Side Posts
[211]  with the Blood Applied by a Bunch of Hyssop
[212]  Exodus 12:22 says, And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin Heb .
[213]  Notice that the blood was put on the entrance of the house, not on the roof.
[214]  The children of Israel were required to stay in the house whose door had been touched with the blood; they were not to go out of it until the morning 12:22 .
[215]  To understand the significance of this we need to see that the basic concept in the Bible with respect to redemption is identification or union.
[216]  The redemption of Christ is mysterious, beyond our understanding.
[217]  I believe that this is the reason the Passover in the Old Testament portrays all the elements, factors, and aspects of the redemption of Christ revealed in the New Testament.
[218]  If we had the plain words of the New Testament without the picture in the Old Testament, it would be difficult for us to see all the details of the wonderful and mysterious redemption of Christ.
[219]  How we thank the Lord for the portrait of redemption presented in the book of Exodus!
[220]  Exodus 12:16 says, And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
[221]  This signifies that in the enjoyment of God s salvation, there is no place for our work.
[222]  Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it 12:44, 48 .
[223]  We are not hired servants, but we have been purchased by the Lord to be His slaves.
[224]  Exodus 12:51 concludes, And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies Heb .
[225]  This verse indicates that God s complete redemption produces an army.
[226]  After applying the Passover according to all the principles given by God, we need to continue our enjoyment of the Passover by making an exodus from Egypt to become God s army to fight for His interests on earth.
[227]  Now we come to Israel s exodus from Egypt, an event which followed the Passover.
[228]  As we all know, the word exodus means a going out.
[229]  Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued to such an extent that they actually drove the children of Israel out of Egypt 12:33, 39; 11:1 .
[230]  The Egyptians could not tolerate the presence of God s people in their country any longer.
[231]  Exodus 12:35 and 36 say, And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave to them what they asked.
[232]  The children of Israel went forth from Egypt with all their children and their flocks and herds 12:37-38, 31-32 .
[233]  Exodus 12:42 says, It is a night of observation unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night unto Jehovah, an observation for all the children of Israel in their generations Heb .
[234]  During the night of the Passover, the children of Israel had satisfaction, rest, and joy, but they did not sleep.
[235]  In the previous message we saw that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued by God; then they drove the children of Israel out of Egypt 12:29-33; 11:1 .
[236]  The children of Israel had no time to leaven their bread 12:34, 39 , but, according to God s commandment, they plundered the Egyptians of their silver, gold, and raiment 12:35-36; 3:21-22; 11:2-3 .
[237]  X. A DAY OF MEMORIAL IN THE MONTH OF ABIB
[238]  IN WHICH NO LEAVENED BREAD WAS TO BE EATEN
[239]  If we would be sanctified to God by taking Christ as our substitute, we need to experience the month of Abib 13:4 , a period of time that signifies our whole Christian life, a time during which we enjoy new life.
[240]  We have pointed out that the word Abib means sprouting, budding.
[241]  Immediately after the word about Joseph s bones, we have a record regarding the leading and guidance of the Lord 13:20-21; see also 13:17-18; 12:37 .
[242]  This marvelous sequence indicates that God cannot guide people apart from resurrection life.
[243]  When the dry bones become living and begin to walk out of Egypt, God s guidance comes to them.
[244]  The fact that the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are mentioned in relation to Joseph s bones indicates that God s living leading and guidance are related to resurrection life.
[245]  As the Lord guided the children of Israel, He did not lead them to take the short way.
[246]  Instead, He led them to take a roundabout way, a way that may have seemed like a detour.
[247]  However, 13:17 says, God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.
[248]  The Passover signifies redemption; the exodus signifies the going out from the world; and the crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism.
[249]  A full salvation with all these aspects is exactly what we need and what we enjoy today.
[250]  Pharaoh s last struggle was a type of the struggle of Satan and his world over the believers who are to be baptized.
[251]  Then, because they had been hardened by God to pursue His people, the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen v. 23 . Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel to the midst of the Red Sea because the Lord had hardened the hearts of the Egyptians.
[252]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE ISRAEL S CROSSING OF THE RED SEA Scripture Reading: Exo 14:10-12, 16, 29-31; 15:1-21; Heb 11:29; 1 Cor 10:1-2; 1 Pet 3:20-21
[253]  When they were in Egypt, they were like the Egyptians; they were sinful and even worshipped idols Ezek.
[254]  In 1 Corinthians 10:2 Paul says that the children of Israel were all baptized unto Moses.
[255]  Moses was a type of Christ and a representative of Christ.
[256]  Referring to the water of baptism typified by the flood in Genesis, 1 Peter 3:20 speaks of being saved through water Gk.
[257]  . We have pointed out that both Noah s family and the children of Israel were saved through water.
[258]  Furthermore, they were saved to the wilderness of separation, that is, to a realm which is for the accomplishment of God s purpose 3:18 .
[259]  We have pointed out that Exodus is a book of pictures that portray God s salvation as revealed in the New Testament.
[260]  This salvation is spiritual, mysterious, and related to the divine life.
[261]  Therefore, in His wisdom, God uses the pictures in Exodus to depict His salvation.
[262]  The crossing of the Red Sea marked the completion of the first stage of God s salvation of His chosen people.
[263]  We are told in 15:22 that during this journey of three days in the wilderness, the children of Israel did not find any water.
[264]  This signifies that in the realm of resurrection there is no natural water, no natural supply.
[265]  After we are baptized and brought into the realm of resurrection, we may expect to receive a certain kind of help, the help that comes from natural water.
[266]  The fact that God led His people to Marah indicates that as we walk in the realm of resurrection, God will lead us to a place of bitterness, to Marah.
[267]  Immediately after the waters were made sweet, the Lord made a statute for the people and an ordinance, and there he tested them v. 25, Heb . Then He said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah thy Healer Heb, Jehovah Ropheka, v. 26 . When I first read this promise, I could not understand why it was mentioned immediately following the healing of the bitter waters.
[268]  If we consider this in the light of our experience, we shall realize that the cross of Christ heals not only our bitter situation, but it also heals us.
[269]  After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the pillar of cloud led them to Marah, and then to Elim.
[270]  If we study a map, we shall see that they did not journey in a way that was according to the human concept, but in a way that was according to the divine concept.
[271]  We have pointed out that when the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, God did not lead them through the way of the land of the Philistines 13:17 .
[272]  God deliberately led them to the south so that they could be baptized in the Red Sea, the baptistry He had prepared for them in His creation.
[273]  Elim is a plural noun that means the mighty ones or the strong ones.
[274]  At the end of 15:27 we are told that the children of Israel "encamped there by the waters."
[275]  The word encamped indicates that God's people had been formed into an army.
[276]  The flowing and growing life supplies God's people as His army.
[277]  When we come to chapter seventeen, we shall see God's people entering into battle as an army.
[278]  The book of Exodus was not written according to doctrine, but according to experience.
[279]  After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Lord led them to Marah.
[280]  Just three days earlier, God s people had experienced His salvation at the Red Sea.
[281]  As we shall now see, our flesh is exposed because of the lack of nourishment, because of the lack of Christ as the heavenly life supply.
[282]  This is the reason that the mention of manna both in Exodus 16 and in Numbers 11 is in relation to the murmuring of the people.
[283]  GOD S DEALING WITH THE FLESH OF HIS PEOPLE A. Hearing Their Murmurings
[284]  Let us go on to see how the Lord comes in to deal with the flesh of His people 16:4-30 .
[285]  After the glory of the Lord appeared to the people, He sent them the meat they wanted.
[286]  He sent quails 16:13; Num 11:31 to satisfy their lust in eating 16:12; Num 11:18, 32 , to show them His sufficiency and to discipline them with His anger Num 11:19-20, 33-34 .
[287]  In Exodus 16 the Lord did not deal with the people in a harsh way.
[288]  But when they murmured and complained again in Numbers 11, the Lord said through Moses, Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; but even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised Jehovah which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? vv.
[289]  OF HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Exo 16:1-4, 8-13a; Num 11:1-6, 10-23, 31-34
[290]  Let us now go on to see how God dealt with His people when they murmured and complained about the lack of food.
[291]  As we consider this matter, we need to realize that we all have the tendency to understand the Bible in a natural way.
[292]  According to our natural understanding, we may think that in Exodus 16 God was merely testing the children of Israel.
[293]  We may believe that God purposely withheld food in order to test His people and to expose their lack of faith.
[294]  According to this point of view, the children of Israel did not have the faith to wait on God, to trust in Him, to rest in Him, and to praise Him.
[295]  The food in Egypt suited the flesh of God s people.
[296]  The more they ate of Egyptian food, the more fleshly they became, for the Egyptian diet corresponded to the people s flesh and nourished it.
[297]  By means of God s discipline the children of Israel saw His glory.
[298]  However, they did not see it in a pleasant way.
[299]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that often when we are murmuring against the Lord, His glory appears to us.
[300]  However, when we are right with Him, His presence may not seem particularly noticeable.
[301]  In this message we shall consider the change of diet implied in chapter sixteen.
[302]  There is no matter in the whole book of Exodus more crucial than this.
[303]  In the past we have seen the importance of the Passover in chapter twelve.
[304]  The Passover implies redemption and regeneration, for with the Passover we have the blood of the lamb for redemption and the meat of the lamb for life.
[305]  For example, if people are consumed with watching television, they become television.
[306]  Likewise, if they are given to a certain sport or amusement, they become constituted with that sport or amusement.
[307]  If we would understand the Bible, we need heavenly enlightenment and vision.
[308]  This is especially true if we are to see the spiritual significance of the various matters in the book of Exodus.
[309]  In the foregoing messages we have seen that Exodus is a book of pictures.
[310]  However, if we have no light and no vision as we read this book, we shall not be able to grasp the meaning of all these pictures.
[311]  Manna is a type of Christ John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58 .
[312]  As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father v. 32 for God s chosen people to live by Christ v. 57 . Although we may readily acknowledge that manna is a type of Christ, we should not regard this in a natural way or superficial way.
[313]  As we consider the account of the sending of manna in Exodus 16, it is important for us to see the relationship between our eating and our living.
[314]  The children of Israel could even say, There is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes Num 11:6b .
[315]  In relation to Christ as the unique food for God s people, I wish to say a word about the uniqueness of the ministry.
[316]  Let us now turn to the various characteristics of manna.
[317]  In Exodus 16 and Numbers 11 we are given a brief description of manna.
[318]  We have pointed out that the quails came in the evening, but the manna was sent in the morning.
[319]  Exodus 16:21 says that the children of Israel gathered it every morning.
[320]  The fact that manna came in the morning indicates that it gives us a new beginning.
[321]  In the previous message we pointed out that manna came from heaven 16:4 , that it came with the dew 16:13b-14; Num 11:9 , and that it came in the morning 16:13b, 21 .
[322]  In this message we shall consider a number of other characteristics of manna.
[323]  In 16:31 and Numbers 11:7 we are told that the manna was like coriander seed.
[324]  This indicates that as food Christ is full of life.
[325]  When we eat Christ, He comes into us as a seed.
[326]  Numbers 11:8 says that the taste of manna was as the taste of fresh oil, or of oil cakes.
[327]  When we eat Christ as our manna, we taste the Spirit of God.
[328]  In this message we come to a very deep matter concerning manna: the keeping of an omer of manna in a pot before the Lord for future generations 16:31-36 .
[329]  The commandment to lay up this portion of manna before the Lord was somewhat unusual.
[330]  Nowhere else in the Bible do we read that God commanded His people to preserve an item of food before Him for coming generations.
[331]  But after the children of Israel had begun to enjoy manna, God charged them to take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah 16:33, Heb .
[332]  The fact that the Christ we eat is the Christ we preserve indicates that whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come.
[333]  Only the Christ we have eaten and experienced is worthy of remembrance.
[334]  The Christ whom we enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because the Christ we experience and enjoy becomes our very constitution.
[335]  He actually becomes the reconstituting element for God s people, that element which causes them to be reconstituted.
[336]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE HEAVENLY DIET MANNA 5 Scripture Reading: Exo 16:13b-15, 31-36; Heb 9:4; Rev 2:17 B. In a Golden Pot
[337]  In 16:33 we see that an omer full of manna was placed in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept for future generations.
[338]  Hebrews 9:4 speaks of the golden pot that had the manna.
[339]  Thus, the hidden manna was in a golden pot.
[340]  The manna concealed in the golden pot signifies that our life is hidden with Christ in God.
[341]  In Colossians 3:3 Paul tells us that our life has been hidden with Christ in God.
[342]  In 16:34 we read that Aaron laid up the pot with an omer of manna before the Testimony, to be kept.
[343]  Some translators of the Bible consider that the testimony here refers to the ark.
[344]  In the Old Testament the testimony does not refer to the ark; it refers to the law of God, the Ten Commandments.
[345]  According to Revelation 2:17, the hidden manna is for the overcomers.
[346]  The open manna was for the enjoyment of the Lord s people in a public way; the hidden manna is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.
[347]  While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.
[348]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY THE LIVING WATER OUT OF THE SMITTEN ROCK 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13; 1 Cor 10:1-4
[349]  Having already covered the heavenly manna in chapter sixteen, we come in this message to the living water out of the smitten rock 17:1-7 .
[350]  We need to pay attention to the sequence of events in chapters sixteen and seventeen.
[351]  When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they saw God s almighty power displayed in the plagues brought upon the Egyptians miraculously by divine intervention.
[352]  Furthermore, they experienced the Passover and the exodus, through which they were delivered from Pharaoh s tyranny.
[353]  Having made their exodus from Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea.
[354]  Then, at Marah, God s people experienced the changing of the bitter water into sweet water.
[355]  In many places the Bible tells us that God is our rock.
[356]  Deuteronomy 32:18 refers to God as the rock who begot us.
[357]  This indicates that as our rock God is our Father.
[358]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE LIVING WATER OUT OF THE SMITTEN ROCK 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13; 1 Cor 10:1-4 THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TEMPTING GOD
[359]  When the children of Israel came into a region where there was no water, they quarreled with Moses and tempted God 17:1-2; Num 20:2-3 .
[360]  Suppose that you had been among the children of Israel at that time.
[361]  You would have seen God s miraculous power exercised in sending the plagues on the Egyptians.
[362]  In 17:7 we are told that the name of the place was called Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord.
[363]  The original name of this place, perhaps the native name, was Rephidim.
[364]  In our family life or church life God often allows us to come to a stage of dryness.
[365]  Concerning the water flowing from the smitten rock in 17:6, there are some matters which are spiritual and mysterious.
[366]  In order to understand these matters, we need to see that every record in the Bible has a spiritual significance.
[367]  We should not try to understand any portion of the biblical record simply according to the black and white letter.
[368]  I. THE WATER OF LIFE BEING THE TRIUNE GOD
[369]  The water of life is the Triune God flowing out to be our life.
[370]  To say that the water of life is the Triune God may shock those who are systematic and dogmatic in their theology.
[371]  In this verse Paul says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[372]  We have pointed out that the water of life is the Triune God.
[373]  Some may wonder whether the water of life is the Spirit or it is the Triune God.
[374]  The proper way to understand the divine revelation in the Bible concerning this is to say that the water of life is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Triune God, and the Triune God is the water of life.
[375]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE DRINKING THE WATER OF LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 17:3a, 6; John 7:37-39; 4:10, 14; 1 Cor 10:4; 12:13, 3; Rev 21:6; 22:1-2, 17; Acts 2:17a, 21
[376]  In the Bible the basic principle concerning man s relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God.
[377]  Because eating and drinking are so common in our daily life, they have not been given much consideration by the great teachers and scholars of the Bible.
[378]  Nevertheless, in the Scriptures eating and drinking are basic and crucial.
[379]  When I was young, I was told that those portions of the Word which speak of eating and drinking the Lord are merely parables or metaphors.
[380]  I was taught that we could not actually eat Jesus, that this is simply a figure of speech, a metaphor.
[381]  But recently as I have been considering the eating and drinking of the Lord Jesus, I have been impressed by Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 10:4.
[382]  Here Paul does not say that the rock was a type of Christ or a symbol of Christ; he says clearly that the rock was Christ.
[383]  In this message we shall consider what is revealed in the Bible concerning the way to drink the water of life.
[384]  I can testify that I have spent more than thirty years to find out how to drink the living water.
[385]  In the foregoing message I pointed out that although I preached a great deal about drinking of the living water, I myself did not know how to drink.
[386]  In John 7:37 the Lord Jesus invites the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink.
[387]  Finally, we drink the water of life through receiving and taking by believing.
[388]  According to John 7:39, we receive the Spirit as the living water by believing into Christ.
[389]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE FLOWING THE WATER OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Exo 17:6; John 4:14; 7:38; Rev 22:2
[390]  In the Bible we see that the drinking of the water of life and the flowing of the water of life go together.
[391]  The drinking is connected to the flowing, and the flowing is one with the drinking.
[392]  In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus says, But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.
[393]  Here we see that if we drink the water of life, this water will become a spring within us welling up into eternal life.
[394]  Doctrinally speaking, in order to flow the water of life we must have our thirst quenched John 4:14 .
[395]  This means that if we are not filled with the living water, there cannot be any overflow.
[396]  The flowing comes from the overflow, and the overflow comes from having our thirst quenched.
[397]  When we remain silent and refuse to speak, it is rather easy for us to become angry or to lose our temper.
[398]  However, if we are continually speaking, singing, and giving thanks, it will be difficult for us to lose our temper.
[399]  This indicates that the flowing of the water of life is a repellent which drives away the negative things, all the flies, scorpions, and gophers.
[400]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE DEFEAT OF AMALEK Scripture Reading: Exo 17:8-16; 1 Pet 2:11; Deut 25:17-19; 1 Sam 15:2; Rom 7:24; 8:34b; Heb 7:25; Gal 5:16-17; Rom 8:13; Num 24:20
[401]  This fact is confirmed by the picture presented in 17:8-16.
[402]  In chapter sixteen we have the manna from heaven as the life supply, and in chapter seventeen, the living water flowing out of the cleft rock for the quenching of our thirst.
[403]  The flesh enjoys fighting and never wants to keep the peace.
[404]  In defeating Amalek the Lord used weak men Exo 17:9; Rom 7:24 .
[405]  In 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek.
[406]  THE DESTINY OF AMALEK A. The Remembrance of Him
[407]  Chapters one through seventeen of Exodus form a complete section.
[408]  In this section we have a full picture of God s salvation, a picture that includes both the dealing with the world and the dealing with the flesh.
[409]  Then God came in to deal with the world, to accomplish redemption, and to deliver His people from the world.
[410]  If we have a bird s-eye view of the first seventeen chapters of Exodus, we shall see a picture of God s salvation which begins with the dealing with the world and concludes with the dealing with the flesh.
[411]  God also determined to have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
[412]  In many places in the Old Testament we see that God s people fought against Amalek.
[413]  We also fight against Amalek by putting the flesh to death with the fighting Spirit Rom 8:13; Gal 5:17, 24 .
[414]  Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.
[415]  Nevertheless, in Romans 8:13, we see that we still must by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body.
[416]  If we do not believe that our old man has been crucified with Christ on the cross, we shall not be able to deal with our flesh.
[417]  A basic principle in the Bible is that the spiritual things revealed in the New Testament are portrayed by the pictures, or types, in the Old Testament.
[418]  This is true in the case of the flesh, typified by Amalek.
[419]  In his writings, Paul dealt with the flesh in a thorough way.
[420]  In verse 7 Paul says that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God and that it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.
[421]  The second picture of the flesh is that of Amalek in the book of Exodus.
[422]  In this picture we see how to deal with the flesh, a subject we covered in the foregoing message.
[423]  If we would deal with the flesh, typified by Amalek, we must be identified with the interceding Christ in the heavens and join ourselves to the fighting Spirit within us.
[424]  The fact that this portrait is presented after the war against Amalek indicates that when Amalek is dealt with, the kingdom with the kingship immediately comes in. This also indicates that Amalek is versus kingship.
[425]  the Best of the Cattle for Sacrifice unto Him
[426]  God would not accept Saul s excuse that the people had spared the best of the cattle and oxen to offer as a sacrifice unto the Lord.
[427]  God had commanded Saul to utterly destroy everything belonging to Amalek, and Saul was without excuse.
[428]  God did not want the best of the cattle to be used as a sacrifice for Him.
[429]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE A TYPE OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Exo 18; Deut 1:9-18
[430]  However, it is actually the most difficult chapter in the book of Exodus to understand.
[431]  To understand this chapter, we need to realize that, in principle, Exodus is a picture of God s full salvation.
[432]  In this message we shall consider what part of God s salvation is portrayed in chapter eighteen.
[433]  However, if we care for the principle that Exodus is a picture book portraying God s full salvation, we shall want to know the significance of Exodus 18 with respect to this portrait.
[434]  THE PORTRAIT OF THE KINGDOM A. The Israel of God
[435]  Now we shall consider the portrait of the kingdom in Exodus 18.
[436]  As we have indicated, the kingdom comes in after God s enemy, Amalek, which typifies the flesh, has been defeated 17:13-16 .
[437]  The New Testament reveals that the kingdom comes when God s chosen people have defeated His enemy.
[438]  The Bible also indicates that when the kingdom comes as a result of the defeat of God s enemy, the Gentiles who are seeking God will come to worship Him.
[439]  In 18:13-27 we have a picture of the authority and order of the kingdom.
[440]  Christ, signified by Moses, is the Head of authority, and under the headship of Christ is the order of authority.
[441]  Some Bible teachers say that Jethro s proposal to Moses was according to the human way of organization.
[442]  AND INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM Scripture Reading: Exo 19:1-25; 3:1, 12; 5:1, 3a
[443]  If we read the book of Exodus in the spirit with much prayer and thereby enter into the spiritual significance of this book, we shall see that it portrays God s salvation from the beginning to its consummation.
[444]  Exodus is composed of two main sections, chapters one through eighteen and chapters nineteen through forty.
[445]  In the first section we see God s salvation, God s provision, the victory over the flesh, and, in chapter eighteen, a portrait of the kingdom of God.
[446]  After God s chosen and called people had been brought into the kingdom, they were ready to accomplish God s purpose to build His dwelling place on earth.
[447]  The main point in chapters nineteen through forty is that God s saved people are brought into the presence of God and into the knowledge of God.
[448]  If we would enter into fellowship with God, we need to experience His full salvation.
[449]  We need to be saved from the condemnation of sin, the world, and Satan, as seen in chapters one through fourteen.
[450]  If we do not have such an experience and enjoyment, we shall not be able to have fellowship with God.
[451]  Exodus 19:11 says, And be ready against the third day: for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai Heb .
[452]  It is significant that this verse does not speak of the second day or the fourth day, but speaks of the third day.
[453]  In the fellowship with the Lord we also begin to know the holiness of God 19:10-24 .
[454]  In Exodus 19 Mount Sinai was a holy mountain because God had descended upon it.
[455]  REVEALING HIM TO HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Exo 20:1-17; 16:34; 25:16; 27:21; 31:18; 25:21-22; 26:33-34; 38:21; 34:28; Num 1:50, 53; Deut 4:13; Psa 19:7
[456]  In chapter nineteen the children of Israel were brought into God s presence and began to have fellowship with Him at His mountain.
[457]  The basic concept in this chapter is that God reveals Himself to His people and thus enables them to know what kind of God He is.
[458]  We have seen that in 34:28 the Ten Commandments are called the ten words of God.
[459]  The Ten Commandments also reveal that our God is righteous.
[460]  Because He is righteous, He will visit those who hate Him for three or four generations.
[461]  If He failed to do this, He would not be a righteous God.
[462]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO THE LAW BEING THE LIVING WORD OF GOD
[463]  INTO HIS LOVING SEEKERS Scripture Reading: Exo 20:1-17; 34:28; 31:18; Deut 4:13; Psa 19:7-8
[464]  However, I gradually came to realize, especially from reading the book of Exodus, that nothing that is of God or from God could ever be negative.
[465]  TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE LAW A. The Loving Seekers of God
[466]  Let us now go on to see how two different kinds of people dealt with the law.
[467]  Of those who lovingly sought God, let us consider the experience of the psalmists in the Old Testament and that of Simeon and Anna in the New Testament.
[468]  In their experience, the psalmists were also infused with the riches of God.
[469]  Psalm 52:8 says, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
[470]  As a tree absorbs riches from the soil, the psalmists absorbed the riches of God.
[471]  They were like olive trees planted in the house of God, and they were being infused with God s riches so that they could grow spiritually.
[472]  Psalm 92:13 and 14 also reveal that the psalmists were infused with God s riches: Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
[473]  As those who lovingly sought God, the psalmists treasured the law of God.
[474]  Psalm 119:14 says, I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
[475]  As we contrast the situation of the loving seekers of God with that of the letter-keepers of the law, we see that in this matter the principle is the same both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.
[476]  If we love the Lord, seek Him with our whole heart, dwell with Him, and enjoy His riches, His substance will be infused into us.
[477]  Thus, what is lived out of us will be the expression of God.
[478]  IN GIVING HIS LAW TO HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Exo 20:1-12; 3:14-15; Jer 31:3, 32; 2:2; Hosea 2:19-20; Isa 54:5; Ezek.
[479]  Those who seek God will love His law as His living word.
[480]  Through such a love for God and His word, they will be infused with God s substance and live in a way which corresponds to what He is.
[481]  God s desire is to express Himself through a people.
[482]  Since God s law is the expression of what God is, to correspond to the law is to correspond to God.
[483]  God s people can have such a correspondence only by loving Him and being infused with His substance.
[484]  AND BECOMING ONE WITH HIM 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; Jer 31:3, 32; 2:2; John 3:29; Matt 9:15; Eph 5:25-27; 2 Cor 11:2; Rev 19:7; John 21:15-17; 2 Cor 5:14-15; John 14:21, 23; S. S. 1:2-4
[485]  If we would have a proper understanding of God s giving of the law in the Scriptures, we need to know how this matter is related to the main subject of the Bible as a whole.
[486]  Although God is divine and we are human, it is still possible for us to be one with Him.
[487]  But in order for God to be one with us and for us to be one with Him, there must be love between us and God.
[488]  Unless there is mutual love, it is not possible for a man and woman to live together as husband and wife and remain truly one.
[489]  They may quote John 3:16, concerning God s love for the world, 1 John 3:1 concerning God the Father s love for His children, or Ephesians 5:25, concerning Christ s love for the church.
[490]  Because of the Lord s enlightening through His word, I have the confidence to say that the entire Bible is a book of engagement.
[491]  In the Scriptures we have a record of how God courts His chosen people and eventually marries them.
[492]  For eternity, the Triune God as the Husband will enjoy a sweet married life with His wife, His chosen and redeemed people.
[493]  In Ezekiel 16:8 God said to His people, Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.
[494]  Because the truths in the Bible are so profound, we cannot understand them unless we use illustrations and parables.
[495]  This is true of what the Bible says about how the life of God enters into us.
[496]  God s life does not come into us like water poured into a glass.
[497]  The Lord Jesus regenerates the church so that the church may be His bride John 3:3, 5, 29-30 .
[498]  The Lord is the Bridegroom with the divine life and the divine nature.
[499]  Apart from possessing this life and nature, we could never become Christ s counterpart.
[500]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that both the Old and New Covenants were espousal covenants, covenants of engagement.
[501]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that we keep the law of God by loving Him.
[502]  Furthermore, we keep God s law by becoming one with Him.
[503]  God s goal in giving the law was to make His chosen people one with Him as a wife is one with her husband.
[504]  ENJOYED HIS LAW 1 Scripture Reading: Psalm 119:1-2, 14-16, 20, 30, 35-36, 40, 42-43, 45, 47-48, 54, 55, 58, 66, 70, 74, 77, 80, 92, 94, 97, 103, 111-114, 117, 119, 127, 131-132, 135, 140, 147, 159, 162, 165, 167-170, 172-174; 19:10b
[505]  Psalm 119 is a psalm which dwells specifically on the law.
[506]  The longest piece in the book of Psalms, this psalm was written according to the sequence of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with each of its twenty-two sections using eight verses for each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters.
[507]  The Old Testament seekers of God also prayed that the Lord s face would shine upon them.
[508]  This thought is based upon the second aspect of the priests blessing in Numbers 6:24-26: The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
[509]  Prayer for the shining of God s face is also found in Psalm 4:6 and in 80:3, 7, 19, where the psalmist prays, Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine.
[510]  According to 2 Corinthians 4:6, we can experience this shining: Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[511]  Considering God s law to be His word, the psalmist believed in the word: Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments 119:66 .
[512]  According to the New Testament, the first requirement in taking the Word of God is that we believe in it.
[513]  We must believe in its genuineness, its accuracy, its authority, and its power.
[514]  We need to have a sound heart in the word of God.
[515]  Such a heart is healthy, having no spiritual sickness related to God s word.
[516]  We need to be healed of all spiritual disease so that our heart may be pure, sound, and healthy toward the word of God.
[517]  Because our heart often has the tendency to depart from God s word, we need to pray that our heart would be called back to God s word and be inclined to it.
[518]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN HOW THE OLD TESTAMENT SEEKERS OF GOD
[519]  ENJOYED HIS LAW 2 Scripture Reading: Psalm 119:1, 11, 14-16, 31-32, 34-35, 48, 51-52, 59, 72-73, 87, 95, 99, 102, 106, 111, 127-128, 130, 148, 157, 161-162, 166, 176
[520]  Like all the other psalms, this psalm was not written according to doctrine or theology, but according to the deep sentiment and aspiration of the psalmist.
[521]  In our spiritual experience we also consider the Word of God.
[522]  Throughout the day we may consider what we enjoyed in our musing upon the Word in the morning.
[523]  By recalling our enjoyment of the Lord in the Word, we receive further nourishment from the Word.
[524]  In verse 161 the psalmist says, My heart standeth in awe of thy word.
[525]  We also should stand in awe of the Word of God.
[526]  Concerning it, we should be in fear and trembling v. 120 . Paul used such an expression both in 1 Corinthians 2:3 and in Philippians 2:12.
[527]  TO HIS LOVING SEEKERS Scripture Reading: Psa 119:11, 25, 28, 41, 49-50, 57-58, 65-66, 76, 98-101, 103, 105, 114, 116-117, 133, 135, 165, 175b; Psa 19:7-8; Eph 6:17-18a; 5:18-20; Col 3:16-17
[528]  In this message, another message on the day aspect of the law, we shall consider the function of God s law as His living word to His loving seekers.
[529]  As God s living word, the law is the divine breath, the very breath of God.
[530]  If we do not regard God s law as His breath and if we do not lovingly seek Him, we shall not experience the positive function of the law.
[531]  In Psalms 119 and 19 we see at least twenty-six functions of God s law as His living word to those who lovingly seek Him.
[532]  The Word of God gives us light; then it quickens us, enlivens us, gives us life.
[533]  THROUGH HIS LAW AS HIS LIVING WORD 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 119:130, 105; 19:8b; 119:25, 50; 1:1a, 2-3; 19:7a; 119:41, 110, 170, 28, 76, 103, 116-117
[534]  In this message and in the message following we shall consider the blessing we may receive from the living Word of God.
[535]  Another problem of the heart in relation to the Word is that of not having any heart at all for the Word.
[536]  We have pointed out the problem of not using or exercising our heart in reading the Word.
[537]  However, there is a difference between this and not having a heart for the Word.
[538]  The Bible requires more of us than any other book.
[539]  The Bible demands that we humble ourselves and put aside our self-confidence and self-assurance.
[540]  In coming to the Word, we need to pray that the Lord will have mercy on us.
[541]  If we do not receive the Lord s mercy, something within us unconsciously may continue to cover us and keep us from the Lord s Word.
[542]  In 119:130 the psalmist says, The entrance of thy words giveth light.
[543]  This means that the Bible has an opening, a gate.
[544]  When we come to the Word of God, we need to open our entire being.
[545]  We need to use our whole being, our body, soul, and spirit.
[546]  We use our eyes to read the words and our mouth to sound out the words.
[547]  The study of the Bible also requires the exercise of our emotion to love the Word and the exercise of our will to take God s way in His Word.
[548]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY THE BLESSING RECEIVED
[549]  THROUGH HIS LAW AS HIS LIVING WORD 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 119:11, 57-58, 65, 98-101, 114, 133, 135, 169, 175; 19:7b
[550]  This message continues the day aspect of the law.
[551]  To be sure, this is the highlight of all the blessings we receive through the living Word of God.
[552]  These ten blessings will lead us to the highest blessing of all the enjoyment of God Himself as our portion.
[553]  Some may think that the Old Testament saints did not enjoy God as their portion.
[554]  As we enjoy God Himself, we also enjoy His countenance.
[555]  Immediately after speaking of God as his portion, the psalmist says, I entreated thy countenance with my whole heart v. 58, Heb . It is also true in our spiritual experience that when we enjoy God, we desire to see His face.
[556]  Another blessing received by the loving seekers of God through the living Word is that of enjoying God as their hiding place and shield.
[557]  The psalmist declared, Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word v. 114 . When we enjoy God as our portion and experience the shining of His countenance, He becomes our covering and hiding place.
[558]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE NEGATIVE ASPECT OF THE GIVING
[559]  OF THE LAW AND OF ITS FUNCTION 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 19:1-25; 20:18-22; 24:1-18; 32:1-35; 33:1-6; 34:1-4, 29-35; 3:1, 12; 4:27; 18:5; Gal 4:24-25; Heb 12:18-21
[560]  After several messages on the day aspect of the law, we come in this message to the night aspect.
[561]  According to the divine revelation in the Bible, whenever God comes to have contact with man, there are always two aspects of this contact.
[562]  The reason for this is that such contact involves both God and man.
[563]  Before the fall of man in Genesis 3, man was wholly on God s side.
[564]  Mount Horeb, where the law was given, has a twofold significance.
[565]  Not many Christians realize that concerning both the giving of the law and the function of the law, there are two aspects, the day aspect and the night aspect.
[566]  Nevertheless, such a truth lies hidden in the Bible.
[567]  If we get into the depths of the truth in the Bible and consider it in the light of our spiritual experience, we shall see that there are these two aspects related to the giving of the law and its function.
[568]  Christians should never have the attitude that the law of God is not good.
[569]  When God first spoke to the people in chapter nineteen, there was no thunder, darkness, or sound of a trumpet.
[570]  In my experience with the Lord I have learned a particular secret, and I would like to share it with you.
[571]  The secret is whenever you find that the Bible tells you to do a certain thing, do not say, Lord, I ll do this.
[572]  OF THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW A. To Expose Sin
[573]  At this point we need to say a word concerning the function of the law on the negative side.
[574]  THE LAW BECOMING KILLING LETTERS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 7:8-14; 10:5; Lev 18:5; Gal 3:21; John 5:39-40; Ezek.
[575]  36:26-27; Gal 3:2-5; 5:2, 4, 6; 6:15
[576]  God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us as our life so that we may take Him as our person, live Him, and express Him.
[577]  In order to fulfill this purpose, God created man in His image and after His likeness.
[578]  This indicates that God wanted man to eat of this tree, which is a symbol of God Himself as life.
[579]  In Romans 7:12 and 14 Paul uses four words to describe the law: spiritual, holy, just, and good.
[580]  The word spiritual denotes the nature of the law.
[581]  Whenever the law is separated from the living God as the source of life, it becomes the condemning and killing element to sinful people Rom 7:13, 11 .
[582]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE THE VEIL OVER THE GLORY OF THE MINISTRY
[583]  OF CONDEMNATION AND DEATH Scripture Reading: Exo 34:29-35; 2 Cor 3:7, 9a, 13-18
[584]  In this message we shall continue to consider the night side of the law.
[585]  In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 9 Paul used all the key words in the title of this message, The Veil over the Glory of the Ministry of Condemnation and Death.
[586]  At this point we need to ask why Moses ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and death.
[587]  This principle applies to unbelievers and to believers as well.
[588]  Paul tells us that one day we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[589]  Today every word in the New Testament is a word of blessing.
[590]  But on the day we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the words of the New Testament may become to us words of condemnation.
[591]  In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul expounded Exodus 34 not for the sake of the children of Israel, but for our sake.
[592]  In verse 18 he eventually speaks of an open face, an unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord.
[593]  THE VEIL ON THE HEART OF GOD S PEOPLE
[594]  Both the Old Testament and the New stress the importance of our heart.
[595]  The Old Testament commands us to love the Lord our God with all our heart.
[596]  In the book of Revelation we see that the decline of the church began with the loss of the first love for the Lord.
[597]  The book of Genesis can be summarized by two phrases: God s creation and man s fall.
[598]  Thus, Genesis opens with a word about God s creation and concludes with a word about Joseph put in a coffin in Egypt.
[599]  We have pointed out that in verse 23 the people were commanded not to make gods of silver or gold.
[600]  This verse mentions only idols of gold and silver, not idols of other materials such as wood and stone.
[601]  Therefore, this verse implies that we should not worship silver or gold.
[602]  Peter said to him, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene walk! v. 6 . Peter did not have silver and gold, but he had the name of Jesus Christ.
[603]  To present the peace offering means that we offer Christ to God for our enjoyment and satisfaction mutually with God.
[604]  The proper worship of God must include the burnt offering and the peace offering, something of Christ offered to God for His enjoyment and satisfaction and something of Christ which we enjoy with God.
[605]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY MAN S WORK
[606]  THROUGH MAN S WAY Scripture Reading: Exo 20:24-26; Phil 3:2-3; 1 Cor 1:18-25
[607]  In this message I am burdened to give a further word concerning the worship of God from 20:24-26.
[608]  Worship is a very crucial matter in man s relationship with God.
[609]  Throughout the thousands of years of human history, thoughtful people have considered the matter of the worship of God.
[610]  I. THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY MAN S WORK A. Fallen Man Being Sin in the Eyes of God
[611]  Exodus 20:25 says, And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
[612]  Here we see that God does not allow man s work to have a part in the worship of God.
[613]  The entire fallen man is sin pollution in the eyes of God.
[614]  Whether we are cultured or uncultured, educated or uneducated, we are sin before God.
[615]  To Jews the preaching of Christ crucified is a stumbling block, and to Greeks it is foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, this Christ is God s power and God s wisdom v. 24 . Praise the Lord that we have been called to receive a crucified Christ! The decision to receive such a Christ did not originate with us; we have received Him because God has called us.
[616]  NAKEDNESS EXPOSED THROUGH MAN S WAY A. Nakedness Denoting the Shame of Fallen Man
[617]  Exodus 20:26 says, Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
[618]  This indicates that man s nakedness is exposed through man s way.
[619]  CONCERNING MAN S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS Scripture Reading: Exo 21:1-6; Phil 2:7-8; Isa 50:4-5; Psa 40:6-8; Matt 20:28
[620]  In chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus many ordinances are covered.
[621]  This is a special ordinance, an extraordinary ordinance, for it is concerned not with man s relationship with others, but with man s relationship with God.
[622]  Many Bible teachers have pointed out that the slave in 21:1-6 is a type of the Lord Jesus.
[623]  According to 21:2, a Hebrew slave was to be set free after serving his master six years.
[624]  If he obtained a wife and children during his years as a slave, he was to leave them as the property of his master and go out by himself v. 4 . However, the slave might plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free v. 5 . Here we see that continuing as a slave is not a legal requirement; it is a matter of love.
[625]  Because the slave loved his master, his wife, and his children, he did not want to go out free.
[626]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE SUNDRY ORDINANCES OF THE LAW Scripture Reading: Exo 22:28-31; 23:14-19
[627]  We have a sweet taste when we read many portions of the Word.
[628]  Psalm 119:103 declares, How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.
[629]  However, when we read Exodus 21:7 23:19, we may not sense any sweetness.
[630]  I. CONCERNING MAN S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS A. Details to the Ten Commandments 1.
[631]  In 21:12-14, 18-32 we have details related to the commandment forbidding murder.
[632]  As we read these verses, we should observe the principle of noting the sweet spirit in which they were written.
[633]  However, according to verse 13, if a man kills another accidentally, he may flee to a place of refuge: And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
[634]  We may think that the ordinances in 23:12 and 13 are concerned with man s relationship with God instead of man s relationship with others.
[635]  No doubt, the fourth commandment, concerning keeping the Sabbath, is related to God.
[636]  Here we see that keeping the Sabbath day not only involves our relationship with God, but involves our relationship with others.
[637]  Exodus 23:10 and 11 say, And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.
[638]  No doubt, the poor among God s people must have been deeply touched by this ordinance, perhaps touched to the point of weeping over the tenderness and sweetness of God s law.
[639]  Now we may give a summary of the sundry ordinances of the law.
[640]  These ordinances require a man to preserve human life, honor parents, keep marriage pure, to be just, fair, honest, faithful, trustworthy and kind, to care for the needy, not to be greedy for gain, but to be willing to give, and to be a holy man unto God, submitting to Him and His authority and serving Him through the offerings that he may feast with Him regularly.
[641]  OF THE ORDINANCES OF THE LAW 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 20:24-26; 21:2, 13-14; 22:21-23, 25-27, 28
[642]  According to 20:24-26, the altar and sacrifices for the worship of God indicate that in order to worship God fallen man must be redeemed, terminated, and replaced.
[643]  Stealing signifies that fallen man, like Satan, is not satisfied with God s sovereign assignment, but tries to make base gain by transgressing God s regulation 22:1-5 .
[644]  The ordinance concerning strangers, widows, orphans, and the poor signify that fallen man has become a stranger to God s blessing, a widow without Christ as the husband, an orphan without God as the Father, and the poor deprived of the riches of God 22:21-27; 23:9 .
[645]  It is easy to read and understand the ordinances in Exodus 21 through 23 merely according to the letters in black and white.
[646]  AND THE OUTFLOW OF THE WINE AND OIL PRESSES,
[647]  In the foregoing message we considered a number of points related to how to live in Christ.
[648]  We saw that we need to offer the fullness of our harvest of Christ and the outflow of our experience of the cross; that as those redeemed through Christ as our Substitute, we should be separated unto God; that we should be saturated with Christ as our holiness to become holy men unto God; and that we should not eat anything of death, but take only Christ as our life supply.
[649]  NOT SEETHING A KID IN HIS MOTHER S MILK
[650]  Not seething a kid in his mother s milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ.
[651]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTY-THREE THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH
[652]  OF THE PROMISED LAND 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 23:20-33; 3:2, 4, 6, 14, 16; 14:19-20; Judg.
[653]  In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that if we would get into the depths of the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three, we shall see that in them the economy of God with the redemption of Christ is portrayed.
[654]  I. THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH A. Sent by Jehovah
[655]  According to 23:20, the Angel of Jehovah was sent by Jehovah.
[656]  Here we have both a Sender and a sent One.
[657]  In 14:19 we have a clear indication that the Angel of Jehovah was leading the people: And the Angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them.
[658]  The Angel refers to Christ, and the cloud signifies the Spirit.
[659]  Many Christians do not have a proper understanding of the promised land.
[660]  Some think that the good land refers to heaven.
[661]  A well-known hymn even speaks of crossing the cold waves of the Jordan and passing over into the promised land of heaven.
[662]  In the foregoing message we began to consider from 23:20-33 the matter of the Angel of Jehovah for His people to take possession of the promised land.
[663]  We saw that the Angel of Jehovah was sent by Jehovah v. 20 , that Jehovah s name is in Him v. 21 , and that He is actually Jehovah Himself 3:2, 4, 6, 14, 16 . Furthermore, we pointed out that His voice was Jehovah s speaking and that He went before the children of Israel to guard them in the way and to bring them into the good land 23:20, 23 . We also considered the boundaries of the promised land: from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, the Mediterranean, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates.
[664]  My burden in this message is related to the way to take possession of Christ, the way to experience Christ, win Christ, gain Christ, obtain Christ, take hold of Christ, and grasp Christ.
[665]  If we would take possession of the promised land, we must learn to obey the Angel of Jehovah, the One sent to us from God.
[666]  God sent Christ to us in a way that involves many steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement.
[667]  By means of all these steps, God has sent Christ, His Angel, to us.
[668]  In order to take possession of Christ, we need to realize that we have Him with us, even within us, as a living Person.
[669]  After charging us not to provoke the Angel of Jehovah, verse 21 says, He will not pardon your transgressions.
[670]  From our experience we know that once we have provoked the Lord, He will not pardon us until we confess.
[671]  Exodus 23:24 says, Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars lit.
[672]  . This indicates clearly that the children of Israel were to destroy all the idols in the promised land.
[673]  If we have anything within us which is an idol replacing the Lord, that thing will be a snare to us.
[674]  Exodus 23:26 also says, The number of thy days I will fulfil.
[675]  This means that God would cause the people to live to full age, to maturity.
[676]  After the decree of the law with the ordinances, God charged Moses to bring the leaders of Israel up to the mountain to stay with Him for a particular thing: to receive the vision of the tabernacle which they were to build as His dwelling place on earth.
[677]  As we have pointed out, the book of Exodus begins with God s redemption and concludes with God s dwelling place.
[678]  God not only redeemed His people; He also rescued them, delivering them from their bondage in Egypt and bringing them to the wilderness to have intimate fellowship with Him.
[679]  Exodus 24:4 says, And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill lit.
[680]  . The altar indicates that we cannot keep the law of God and that we need to be redeemed.
[681]  Actually, before the law was made known to the people, they had already broken its terms and conditions.
[682]  This message is a continuation of the foregoing message on the enactment of the covenant.
[683]  We have seen that when Moses enacted the covenant, he built both an altar and twelve pillars.
[684]  The pillars signify that we need to become a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is.
[685]  Although we are sinful, fallen, and corrupted, we have the blood for our redemption and for the forgiveness of sins.
[686]  Exodus 24 exposes the ignorance of the children of Israel.
[687]  Verse 3 says, And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath said will we do lit.
[688]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTY-EIGHT THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 24:3-7; Heb 9:18-20, 22, 12-15; 8:8-12; Lev 16:11-16; Ezek.
[689]  Exodus 24:8 says, And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words lit.
[690]  In the foregoing message we placed great emphasis on the fact that it was not God s intention to have His people observe the law He decreed.
[691]  It is impossible for fallen, sinful, and corrupted people to keep the law.
[692]  They simply do not have the ability to observe the law of God.
[693]  Even though God did not intend for the people to keep the law, they presumed that since God had given them His law, they were expected to keep it.
[694]  The children of Israel, however, had absolutely no understanding of God s intention.
[695]  But Moses was a man who knew God s heart and His intention.
[696]  Therefore, he enacted the law not according to the intention of the children of Israel, but according to the intention of God.
[697]  No matter how foolish and ignorant the children of Israel were, Moses nevertheless enacted the law according to God s way.
[698]  God s way was to show the people that, in His sight, they were fallen, sinful, and corrupted and that they desperately needed God s redemption and forgiveness.
[699]  After they received redemption and forgiveness, the redeeming blood would bring them into God s presence where they could contact Him, receive Him into them, and be constituted into pillars as a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is.
[700]  36:26-27; Matt 26:27-28; Heb 13:20-21; 10:19-20; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Rev 22:14; 7:14-17
[701]  In this message we shall cover a number of crucial points related to the blood of the covenant.
[702]  In Ezekiel 36:27 the Lord says, And I will put my Spirit within you.
[703]  For God to put His Spirit within His people is for Him to put Himself into them.
[704]  Many Christians do not understand the difference between a new heart, a new spirit, and God s Spirit.
[705]  I emphasized the matters of a new heart, a new spirit, and the Spirit of God.
[706]  V. THE BLOOD OF CHRIST OF THE NEW COVENANT
[707]  The blood of the sacrifices in the Old Testament typifies the blood of Christ.
[708]  The blood of Christ is the blood of the new covenant Matt 26:28 .
[709]  This blood has done many wonderful things for us.
[710]  Finally, the blood of Christ brings us into the temple of God, where we shall enjoy Him for eternity.
[711]  Those who are brought into God s temple through the cleansing of the blood of Christ are pictured in Revelation 7:15 and 16: Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.
[712]  It is the blood of the covenant which brings us into God, into the divine life and nature, into the inward law of life and the ability of life to know God, and into the infusion, transfusion, and enjoyment of God both now and in eternity.
[713]  Many Christians have read through the book of Exodus without being deeply impressed with the fact that the goal of God s salvation is to bring His redeemed people into His dwelling place on earth.
[714]  The scene in chapter nineteen was dark and threatening.
[715]  But suddenly, in chapter twenty-four the thick cloud passes away, and the sky becomes clear and beautiful.
[716]  Exodus 24:9 and 10 say, Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness lit.
[717]  . Beneath God s feet they saw something that had the appearance of a large transparent stone.
[718]  In 24:12 we see that God called to Moses and said, Come up to me into the mount.
[719]  The Lord seemed to be saying, Moses, the others see Me, but they must worship afar off.
[720]  They cannot be close to Me. I want you to come to Me and stay with Me. Here we have something which goes beyond beholding God under a transparent and clear sky.
[721]  Seeing the vision of the tabernacle is a matter of tremendous significance.
[722]  They may not be concerned with the materials used in building the tabernacle.
[723]  God removed the veil, and Moses saw a vision of heavenly things.
[724]  Exodus 25:2 says, Speak to the sons of Israel, that they take for Me a heave offering; from every man whose heart urges him you shall take My heave offering.
[725]  According to the Old Testament, an offering is something created by God and prepared by Him, yet gained, possessed, and enjoyed by us.
[726]  Suppose, for example, that an Israelite offered a lamb to God.
[727]  Although the lamb was created by God and prepared by Him, the one offering it had to gain it in a rightful way.
[728]  Concerning minerals, we read of gold, silver, bronze, onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.
[729]  These materials were not used for decoration or ornamentation; they were all used for building.
[730]  The onyx stones and other precious stones were used for the shoulder-pieces and the breastplate worn by the high priest.
[731]  Then the people were brought into fellowship with God at Mount Sinai, where they received the law of God.
[732]  We have seen that the plant life is for generating, for producing.
[733]  Christ is the essential factor of the generating and producing life.
[734]  His life is very productive, and He imparts His life to us.
[735]  The acacia wood used in building the tabernacle signifies Christ s human nature, strong in character and high in standard.
[736]  Christ s humanity is not like cotton; on the contrary, it is like acacia wood.
[737]  According to verse 22, this ark was called the ark of the testimony.
[738]  In the book of Exodus the testimony refers to the law.
[739]  God regarded the law decreed through Moses on Mount Sinai as His testimony.
[740]  TYPIFYING CHRIST A. As the Embodiment of God s Testimony
[741]  Christ has many aspects, and these four items show forth different aspects of Him.
[742]  THE MATERIALS OF THE ARK A. Acacia Wood 1.
[743]  Christ s humanity is the basic element, the basic substance, for Him to be God s testimony.
[744]  The acacia wood was overlaid with gold both inside and outside.
[745]  This signifies the divine nature mingled with the human nature God and man becoming one.
[746]  The last sixteen chapters of Exodus are a test of whether or not we truly have a heart seeking after God s economy.
[747]  In their reading of the Bible many Christians skip over these chapters after they have read the book of Exodus through once or twice.
[748]  The number four according to the Bible signifies the four corners of the earth to reach all men Rev 7:1 .
[749]  According to Revelation 5:6 the seven Spirits of God are sent forth into all the earth.
[750]  The acacia wood overlaid with gold here signifies that Christ s divine nature is the expression of His move.
[751]  The move of Christ as the testimony of God is always by His two natures, human and divine, mingled as one.
[752]  In the two foregoing messages we considered the materials of the ark, the dimensions of the ark, and the rim of gold around the top of the ark.
[753]  We have also considered the four rings of gold and the two poles used for the move of the ark.
[754]  In this message we shall consider from 25:17-22 the propitiatory cover which was put on the ark.
[755]  The propitiatory cover signifies Christ as the cover of God s righteous law.
[756]  It also signifies Him as the place where God speaks to His redeemed people in grace.
[757]  Hence, the propitiatory cover equals God s throne of grace Heb 4:16 .
[758]  In verse 22 God also says that He will speak with you from above the propitiatory cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, all that I shall command you concerning the sons of Israel.
[759]  This means that God speaks to His people from the glory expressed in the propitiating Christ as His testimony.
[760]  Thus, for God to speak to His people from between the cherubim means that He speaks to us in the midst of His glory.
[761]  In our study of the tabernacle and its furnishings, we are concerned not merely to know the types in a doctrinal way, but to apply the types to our spiritual experience.
[762]  In this message and in the next two messages I am burdened to speak a further word on the propitiatory cover.
[763]  This cover is made of pure gold, signifying Christ s divine nature, and its size signifies a testimony.
[764]  Furthermore, the two golden cherubim on the propitiatory cover signify God s glory and indicate that God s glory comes out of Christ as the propitiatory cover to be a testimony.
[765]  In the foregoing message we emphasized the fact that God meets with His redeemed people and speaks with them in the propitiating Christ.
[766]  We have seen that the ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.
[767]  The acacia wood and the gold typify the two natures of Christ: the gold typifies His divine nature, and the acacia wood, His human nature.
[768]  Both within and without, the ark was overlaid with gold.
[769]  At this point, we need to consider the portrait of the ark in more detail.
[770]  The Holy of Holies, in which the ark of testimony was situated, was a rather restricted space; it was only ten cubits square.
[771]  In this message we shall continue to consider the significance of the ark of the testimony, especially the propitiatory cover on the ark, for our spiritual experience.
[772]  In the foregoing message we saw that the ark with the propitiatory cover sprinkled by the redeeming blood is a portrait of the Christ who dwells in our spirit.
[773]  Because God s intention is to dispense Himself into man, man needs a spirit in order to receive God.
[774]  Suppose a person who is a typical sinner one day hears the gospel, repents, confesses his sinful deeds, and believes in the Lord Jesus.
[775]  After he repents, confesses, and believes, God meets with him, and he with God.
[776]  To me, Christ as God s testimony is a precious container with God s portrait concealed inside.
[777]  However, not even Paul s completing ministry made these things as clear as John s mending ministry made them.
[778]  The mending ministry was needed because of the damage caused to the church life in the latter decades of the first century.
[779]  John 1:14 says that this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth, and John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
[780]  As the Lamb of God, Christ shed His blood for our redemption.
[781]  In verse 24 the Lord Jesus went on to pray that we would be with Him where He is in glory: Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me. In his first Epistle John speaks of the word of life and of the fellowship with the Father and the Son 1 John 1:1-3 . Following this, he says, But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin v. 7 . In all these verses we have life, blood, fellowship, and glory.
[782]  In a foregoing message we saw that in Romans 3:25 Paul says concerning Christ, Whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood.
[783]  As the propitiation cover, Christ is the One who shed His blood and who shines with the glory of God.
[784]  According to Hebrews 2:17, the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God s righteous demands on us.
[785]  Not many Christians have seen that Christ is the place of propitiation.
[786]  This indicates that those translators regarded the place of propitiation as a seat, realizing that Christ as the place of propitiation was a seat for God to grant mercy to us.
[787]  At this point we need to see that the book of Hebrews is a definition of the ark.
[788]  If we would know the ark of the testimony, we need to study Hebrews.
[789]  Speaking of Christ, Hebrews 1:3 says, Who being the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance.
[790]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY THE TABLE OF THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 25:23-30; Lev 24:5-9
[791]  In this message we come to the second item of the furniture of the tabernacle the table of the bread of the Presence.
[792]  The sequence in which the furniture of the tabernacle is unveiled is very meaningful.
[793]  The first item to be revealed is not the tabernacle itself, but the ark of the testimony.
[794]  This indicates that if we do not have Christ as the embodiment of God, we cannot have the enlargement of Christ, which is the church, His Body.
[795]  The table of the bread of the Presence was set up before God.
[796]  This indicates that the priests enjoyed Christ as a feast before God.
[797]  In contrast, many of those who ate manna did not eat in God s presence.
[798]  They could eat manna in any place, whether or not they were in the presence of God.
[799]  OF THE PRESENCE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 25:23-30; Lev 24:5-9
[800]  This is the continuation of the foregoing message on the table of the bread of the Presence.
[801]  Acacia wood here signifies that Christ s humanity is the basic element for Him to be our feast.
[802]  Within Him, Christ s humanity is the basic element for our enjoyment, and upon Him is His divinity as the expression of God.
[803]  This means that as we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be gold, Christ s divinity as the expression of God.
[804]  Exodus 25:25 says, And you shall make for it a border of a handbreadth round about; and you shall make a rim of gold to its border round about.
[805]  According to our present understanding, the Hebrew word here does denote a border.
[806]  However, it does not denote a border in an ordinary sense.
[807]  From verse 27 we see that the rings were close to the border as receptacles for the poles to carry the table.
[808]  According to Leviticus 24:9, the bread of the Presence was the most holy of the people s offerings to Jehovah made by fire.
[809]  It signifies the surplus of the believers experience and enjoyment of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction.
[810]  The golden lampstand may be regarded as the most mysterious of all the furnishings in the tabernacle.
[811]  The lampstand signifies the expression of the Triune God.
[812]  Exodus 25:37 says, And you shall make its lamps, seven.
[813]  These seven lamps signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits of God for His expression Rev 4:5; 5:6 .
[814]  In the book of Revelation we see that the seven lamps are the Spirit of God.
[815]  Because we have in the lampstand the element of gold signifying God the Father, the stand signifying God the Son, and the seven lamps signifying God the Spirit, we have the ground to say that the lampstand itself is the expression of the Triune God.
[816]  We know from verse 31 that the lampstand was of pure gold.
[817]  As the embodiment of the Father for His expression, Christ is purely divine.
[818]  Verse 31 speaks of the base and the shaft of the lampstand.
[819]  The knobs, the calyxes, the external green leafy parts of the flowers, containing the blossoming buds, signify the sustaining and supporting power of the resurrection life.
[820]  Before we consider more detailed points concerning the lampstand, it will be helpful to have a general view of the lampstand.
[821]  Exodus 25:31 says, And you shall make a lampstand of pure gold; of beaten work shall the lampstand be made: its base and its shaft; its cups, its knobs, and its blossoming buds shall be from it.
[822]  And there shall be six branches going out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side, and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.
[823]  The four cups shaped like almond blossoms on the central stalk of the lampstand with its knobs and its blossoming buds signify Christ s humanity in His shining with the resurrection life.
[824]  The placement of the lampstand with respect to the table and the ark indicates that in the church the light of the truth and the supply of life must match and balance each other for the carrying on of Christ as the testimony of God.
[825]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-FOUR THE LAMPSTAND 3 GROWING, BRANCHING, BUDDING,
[826]  AND BLOSSOMING TO SHINE THE LIGHT Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-40; 40:4, 24-25
[827]  As we consider the various types related to the tabernacle, we shall pay more attention to the aspect of experience than to the aspect of doctrine.
[828]  In the past many books have been written on the furniture of the tabernacle.
[829]  As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light.
[830]  The shining of the lampstand directs us to enjoy Christ as our life supply.
[831]  The light directs us to the table where we have the bread of God s presence for our life supply.
[832]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-FIVE THE COVERING OF THE TABERNACLE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:1-14; 36:8-13 I. THE FIRST LAYER OF THE COVERING
[833]  Verse 1 says, And you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet.
[834]  The latter part of verse 6 says, The tabernacle shall become one.
[835]  The first layer of the covering, the ten curtains of fine linen, typifies Christ s fine humanity.
[836]  We may also say that it typifies Christ as a fine and perfect man.
[837]  Exodus 26:1 mentions the colors blue, purple, and scarlet.
[838]  Blue signifies something heavenly in both nature and appearance.
[839]  As revealed in the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus in His humanity and human living was altogether heavenly.
[840]  Verse 3 says, Five curtains shall be joined one to another, and the other five curtains joined one to another.
[841]  Thus, there were two sets of five curtains each.
[842]  In the previous message we considered the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle.
[843]  As we pointed out, that layer is itself called the tabernacle.
[844]  Exodus 26:1 speaks of making the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine linen.
[845]  THE SECOND LAYER OF THE COVERING A. Typifying Christ Being Made Sin for Us
[846]  We have seen that the second layer of the covering, a tent of goats hair, typifies Christ being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .
[847]  Verse 9 says, And you shall double over the sixth curtain at the front of the tent, and verse 12 says, And the overhanging part that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
[848]  This indicates that after Christ became sin and was judged by God for us, He became the covering and protection of the believers, who are the components of God s dwelling place.
[849]  According to the sequence of the divine revelation, the covering of the tabernacle is mentioned before the boards.
[850]  This is opposite to the human way of speaking about a building, which is to begin with the bottom and proceed upwards toward the roof.
[851]  The divine way of revealing the tabernacle is to begin with the top, with the four layers of covering.
[852]  The first layer typifies Christ as a perfect and complete human being; the second layer typifies Him as the One who was made sin for us and who died on the cross for our sins; the third layer typifies Him as the One who accomplished redemption to meet both God s need and ours; and the fourth layer typifies Him as the One who is strong toward the enemy and who is able to resist all his attacks.
[853]  After I was saved, I knew I had been regenerated, but I had no understanding of what had taken place within me.
[854]  I did not know that I had become a board of acacia wood overlaid with gold.
[855]  I realized simply that I had been saved and that henceforth I should do my best to glorify God.
[856]  Verse 18 says, And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.
[857]  According to verse 20, there were to be twenty boards also on the north side, the second side of the tabernacle.
[858]  To repeat, three signifies the Triune God in resurrection, and ten is the number of human completion.
[859]  Before we consider the tenons, sockets, rings, and bars, I would like to say a word about the corner boards and also about the total number of boards in the tabernacle.
[860]  I appreciate the concept that there must be strengthening at the corners of the tabernacle.
[861]  Verse 19 says, And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards, two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
[862]  They were made of silver, signifying the redemption of Christ as the base for the believers standing for God s dwelling place 30:12-16 .
[863]  The standing of the boards depends on the tenons and the sockets, whereas the linking, or the uniting, depends on the rings and the bars.
[864]  Exodus 26:29 speaks of the rings: And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold, as receptacles for the bars.
[865]  It is difficult to understand why there was a veil within the tabernacle.
[866]  If we consider the situation of the tabernacle as a whole, we may be puzzled by the fact that there was a veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies.
[867]  The tabernacle was a tent thirty cubits in length, ten cubits in width, and ten cubits in height.
[868]  Since both the boards and the pillars typify the believers, we may ask what is the difference between the pillars and the boards.
[869]  Verse 32 mentions that the pillars had hooks of gold.
[870]  These golden hooks signify the holding and connecting strength of the divine nature.
[871]  Only the divine nature can connect the pillars to the incarnated and crucified Christ.
[872]  Only through the holding strength of the divine nature can we bear the testimony of Christ s incarnation and crucifixion.
[873]  At this point we need to consider further the significance of the veil placed on four pillars.
[874]  We have pointed out that these pillars signify extraordinary believers, those who have been not only redeemed, but also dealt with.
[875]  The lamb is the redeeming Christ, the manna is the nourishing Christ, and the veil is Christ in the flesh crucified for us.
[876]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THE VEIL WITHIN THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 9:1-12; Exo 26:33-35; 40:3, 21; Num 4:5; Matt 27:51; Heb 10:19-20
[877]  As we have pointed out a number of times, our aim is to study the book of Exodus in the way of experience and to apply the points as much as possible to our spiritual experience.
[878]  It is not our purpose simply to know the pattern, materials, and measurements of the tabernacle in a doctrinal way.
[879]  Instead of applying these types in a doctrinal way, Paul applied them in an experiential way, either to Christ Himself or to the believers.
[880]  According to the entire book of Hebrews, the first tabernacle, or the Holy Place, is a type or figure of our soul, whereas the second tabernacle, or the Holy of Holies, is a type of our spirit.
[881]  Hebrews 4:16 says, Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.
[882]  We have seen that the throne of grace is the propitiatory cover upon the ark within the veil.
[883]  The word about the dividing of soul and spirit in Hebrews 4:12 is related to this: For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[884]  Not long after I was saved, I read books which pointed out that, according to Romans 6:6, our old man was crucified with Christ.
[885]  Galatians 2:20 says, I have been crucified with Christ.
[886]  I fully believed these verses and was happy to learn that I had been crucified with Christ.
[887]  We may think that these verses are easy to understand.
[888]  Verse 36 says, And you shall make a curtain for the door of the tent of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer.
[889]  The first layer of the covering of the tabernacle has nothing to do with our entering into God s dwelling place.
[890]  But both the veil and the screen are related to entering into the tabernacle.
[891]  How can we enter the dwelling place of the holy and righteous God, the God who is love and light?
[892]  When we come into the tabernacle, we find ourselves in the Holy Place, which is far better than the outer court.
[893]  Praise the Lord that through the death of Christ we have come into the Holy Place where we enjoy the supply of Christ, the enlightenment of Christ, and the acceptance of Christ!
[894]  However, even though we enjoy all this, this does not mean that we enjoy Christ Himself.
[895]  Rather, it means that we enjoy something of Christ, for example, the nourishment of Christ.
[896]  Let us now consider the matter of the entrances.
[897]  There must have been one pillar next to a board on the north side and another pillar next to a board on the south side.
[898]  We have seen that in the tabernacle there were two curtains, one called the veil and the other called the screen.
[899]  We need to pray for spiritual understanding concerning the veil and the screen, for they imply some very important things.
[900]  They indicate that through His all-inclusive death Christ has become the entrance for God s chosen people to come into the enjoyment of God.
[901]  One aspect of Christ s humanity is that of a screen.
[902]  In His humanity the Person revealed, described, and portrayed in the four Gospels was a screen.
[903]  If we read the Gospels from this angle, we shall see that Christ is a screen keeping all the negative things away from God s dwelling place.
[904]  If he believes in Him, the screen will immediately become an entrance through which he may come into the Holy Place, where he begins to enjoy God in Christ and to participate in the rich enjoyment of what Christ is.
[905]  In his Epistles Paul was trying to bring God s people either from the outer court into the Holy Place or, as was more often the case, from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies.
[906]  In 1 and 2 Corinthians Paul was endeavoring to bring all the saints into the Holy of Holies through the crucified Christ, the Christ who is the riven veil.
[907]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THREE THE CURTAIN FOR THE DOOR OF THE TENT 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:36-37; 2 Cor 5:18-21
[908]  In the tabernacle there were two veils, or two curtains.
[909]  Chapter twenty-six of Exodus speaks first of the inner veil and then of the screen.
[910]  The screen indicates that Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven and that we may be justified by God.
[911]  The inner veil indicates that Christ died for us so that our flesh, our fallen nature, may be rent, or torn, and that we may enter the Holy of Holies to enjoy God to the uttermost.
[912]  Then in verse 20 Paul goes on to say, On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
[913]  This second aspect of reconciliation corresponds to what Paul says in Romans 8.
[914]  Romans 8:3, a verse that is very similar to 2 Corinthians 5:21, says, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.
[915]  This corresponds to the word in 2 Corinthians 5:21 about Christ being made sin for us.
[916]  For example, in 2 Corinthians 2:14 through 16 he says, But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place; for we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.
[917]  In 2 Corinthians 3:2 and 3 Paul uses the metaphor of living epistles: You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men; being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.
[918]  Here we see that Paul and his co-workers were writing living epistles.
[919]  When we consider this verse in the light of what Paul says in verse 6, where he speaks of God shining in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ, we realize that the vessel in verse 7 may be likened to a camera.
[920]  The record concerning the altar in Exodus is very difficult to understand.
[921]  As far as the tabernacle itself is concerned, the most difficult matter is the corner boards.
[922]  No one has been able to solve the problem of these corner boards.
[923]  Referring to this, Hebrews 13:10 says, We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.
[924]  The altar among the Israelites in ancient times was a type of the cross as the real altar.
[925]  According to verse 1, the altar was five cubits long and five cubits wide.
[926]  Five times five signifies Christ bearing full responsibility on the cross to fulfill all the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[927]  The Lord Jesus bore such a responsibility on the cross in fulfilling God s threefold demands.
[928]  In the foregoing message I pointed out that it is not easy to understand the record in Exodus concerning the altar.
[929]  We have pointed out that at the four ends of the grating, the network, there were four bronze rings.
[930]  In typology these rings refer to the eternal Spirit spoken of in Hebrews 9:14: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
[931]  Christ s blood is effective because He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.
[932]  Concerning the ledge, we may also say that the ledge signifies the strengthening power upholding Christ under God s judgment.
[933]  Christ was upheld by this strengthening power while He was on the cross suffering the judgment of God.
[934]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:1-8 A TYPE OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST
[935]  When we read the record concerning the altar of the burnt offering in 27:1-8, it seems that there is not much for us to say regarding the altar.
[936]  However, as I was considering this matter, I realized that, in principle, there must be something very important here, because the altar is a type of the cross of Christ.
[937]  In the New Testament the cross is not revealed in a way which corresponds to our natural, human understanding.
[938]  If the cross were presented in this way, probably one of the main writers in the New Testament Paul, John, or Peter would have given us a lengthy definition of the significance of Christ s cross.
[939]  Do you realize what is the situation in today s Christianity with respect to the grating and the rings?
[940]  The situation is this: the rings have been divorced from the grating.
[941]  The fundamentalists have the grating without the rings; the Pentecostals have some kind of rings separate from the grating.
[942]  In 27:1-8, verses 1 through 3 are on the outward appearance of the altar, but verses 4 through 8 are on the inward contents of the altar.
[943]  What is difficult to understand concerning the altar is not the outward appearance; it is the inward contents.
[944]  The contents of the altar are the grating and the four rings, through which were placed the poles used in carrying the altar.
[945]  It is correct to say that it was not the four rings that accomplished redemption.
[946]  The burning for the accomplishment of redemption took place on the grating.
[947]  The grating signifies Christ, and the rings signify the Spirit.
[948]  Christ, not the Spirit, was the One who accomplished redemption.
[949]  In the New Testament whenever the redemption of Christ is preached, it is preached with the power of the Holy Spirit.
[950]  If we had the grating without the four rings, the grating would lose its strength and power.
[951]  Some readers of the Bible may think that the altar of the burnt offering was a table or stand on which the offerings were placed, some kind of box with the sacrifices placed on top.
[952]  It had four sides and a grating in the middle, but no top or bottom.
[953]  If you would read through all twenty-seven books of the New Testament and study each verse related to Christ s redemption, the death of Christ, or the cross of Christ, you still will not have a clear view of what the death of Christ is.
[954]  According to the Bible, it is not simply a temporal death it is an eternal death.
[955]  If we do not have a Christ who issues in the Spirit, then to us Christ is merely a historical figure, and His redemption is nothing more than a doctrine.
[956]  For many Christians today, Christ is just a historical Person, and Christ s redemption is only a doctrine.
[957]  They do not have any personal experience of Christ or of His redemption.
[958]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINE THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING 6 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:4-7; 38:5; Isa 53:8, 10a; 2 Pet 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 3:23-26; Heb 9:14; Gal 3:13-14; Acts 1:8; 2:38; Eph 1:13-14; Gal 3:3 THE LOCATION OF THE GRATING
[959]  In this message we shall consider the matter of the location of the grating inside the altar.
[960]  In Exodus 27 we are told clearly that the grating was at half of the height of the altar.
[961]  Since the altar was three cubits high, the grating was positioned one and a half cubits above the bottom of the altar.
[962]  We have pointed out that the ashes from the sacrifices that burned on the grating fell to the bottom of the altar, whereas the fragrant aroma of the sacrifices ascended to God.
[963]  Thus, the one who presented the sacrifice could see the ashes and thereby have evidence, confirmation, proof, that he had been forgiven and accepted.
[964]  As believers, we may have the assurance that because Christ s redemption reaches the level of God s requirements the standard of His righteousness, holiness, and glory we have been accepted by God.
[965]  Whenever we enjoy Christ and His redemption, we have the sense deep within that Christ s redemption is fully according to the standard of God s requirements.
[966]  Here we see the redeeming Christ issuing in the all-inclusive Spirit for His move through His Body.
[967]  This is portrayed, as we have seen, by the altar with the grating, the rings, and the poles.
[968]  The Body of Christ bears the testimony of Jesus throughout the earth by the all-inclusive Spirit.
[969]  It seems that the court would be easy to understand.
[970]  If we try merely to understand the dimensions and materials of the court, we shall not have difficulty.
[971]  In Romans 14:17 Paul says that the kingdom of God is righteousness.
[972]  Likewise, we shall not have idols, we shall not take God s name in vain, we shall have a sign that we belong to God, and we shall fulfill all the other commandments.
[973]  The court of the tabernacle was a hundred cubits long.
[974]  These hundred cubits were divided into twenty sections by twenty pillars.
[975]  Thus, regarding the length of the outer court, we have the numbers one hundred, twenty, and five, five coming from a hundred divided by twenty.
[976]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:9-19; 38:9-20; 40:33 I. SIGNIFYING THE SPHERE AND BOUNDARY
[977]  The outer court signifies the sphere and boundary of God s building.
[978]  The fine linen signifies the human living of Christ.
[979]  Our expression of righteousness should be the expression of Christ s human living.
[980]  If we read the four Gospels, we shall see that Christ s human living truly was fine, even.
[981]  Verse 11 says, And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods shall be of silver.
[982]  The phrase of bronze governs both the sockets and the pillars, just as the phrase of silver refers both to the hooks and the connecting rods.
[983]  The bronze pillars signify Christ judged by God being the standing and supporting strength of the separation of God s building.
[984]  The area between two pillars was five cubits by five cubits.
[985]  This signifies that Christ s redemption for us matches the requirements of God s righteousness.
[986]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 3 Scripture Reading: Exodus 27:14-16, 19
[987]  In this message we come to the gate of the court of the tabernacle.
[988]  We may think that the gate is the most simple aspect of the outer court.
[989]  However, when we begin to consider this matter, we find that it is not simple at all.
[990]  Now I would ask you to interpret this picture.
[991]  What is the significance of the front side of the tabernacle with the gate?
[992]  Actually, it does not require very much skill to interpret this picture, since the spiritual alphabet is right before our eyes.
[993]  When Peter confessed that He is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord went on to speak concerning the church: And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .
[994]  Having considered the appearance of the gate, let us now see what is the basic material used to produce such an appearance.
[995]  Both the pillars and the sockets for the court of the tabernacle were made of bronze.
[996]  Bronze, as we have pointed out, signifies God s judgment.
[997]  We who would come into the building of God must realize that everything we are, everything we have, everything we do, and everything we are able to do must be judged.
[998]  When in our experience we enter into the outer court of the tabernacle, we find that the most striking element is bronze.
[999]  As we look around, we see sixty pillars of bronze and sixty sockets of bronze.
[1000]  Furthermore, 27:19 says, All the utensils of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court shall be of bronze.
[1001]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 4 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:14-16, 19 ENJOYING THE DIVINE NATURE
[1002]  Outwardly, God s expression is righteousness, signified by the linen.
[1003]  How can we enter into the realm, the sphere, of God s righteousness?
[1004]  We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God s judgment, where everything related to us is judged.
[1005]  Furthermore, we also have the ground, the way, and the means to enter into the gold, into God s nature, and to enjoy the divine nature as everything to us.
[1006]  This is true both in the church life and in married life.
[1007]  If a brother and his wife are willing to be under God s judgment, spontaneously God s righteousness will be upon them.
[1008]  Others who visit their home will be able to see the righteousness of God.
[1009]  But if the husband justifies himself and the wife justifies herself, then visitors in their home will not see anything of God s righteousness.
[1010]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMPS
[1011]  AND THE GARMENTS FOR THE PRIESTHOOD 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:20 28:5
[1012]  With the foregoing message, we finished the life-study of the tabernacle with its outer court.
[1013]  But chapter twenty-seven concludes with two verses on the lighting of the lamps on the lampstand in the tabernacle: And you shall command the sons of Israel that they bring you olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamps continually.
[1014]  It was not a natural light, that is, a light that comes from the sun during the day or from the moon and the stars at night.
[1015]  Neither was the light in the Holy Place a man-made light.
[1016]  The lighting of the lamps by the priests in the Holy Place implies a great deal.
[1017]  The Holy Place is within the church, and the church is God s sanctuary.
[1018]  In the church life the saints are of different ages.
[1019]  Some are very young, and others are old enough to be grandparents.
[1020]  Moreover, the younger ones among us are students, and others have various occupations and professions.
[1021]  But regardless of our age or occupation, when we come together in the meetings, we all should be priests.
[1022]  We have not only Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the divine nature of Christ, the uplifted humanity of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ with all the steps of Christ s process, but we have also the expression of Christ.
[1023]  AND THE GARMENTS FOR THE PRIESTHOOD 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:20 28:5 MEETING TO LIGHT THE LAMPS
[1024]  Throughout the centuries, especially since the Reformation, Christians have been debating the matter of how to meet.
[1025]  The various denominations and Christian groups all meet in their particular way.
[1026]  It includes our experience of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, our experience of the divine nature, our experience of the uplifted humanity of Jesus that burns to give light before God and before His testimony, our experience of the Spirit of God as the oil pressed out of the fruit of the olive tree, and our experience of Christ in His process with the steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[1027]  When we come to the meetings to light the lamps, we may be short of the real experience of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[1028]  We may also be lacking in the experience of the divine nature and the humanity of Christ.
[1029]  Furthermore, we may not have the oil of the Spirit of Christ.
[1030]  Another reason for lighting the lamps in the Holy Place is that when there is light in the sanctuary, we can see the different items of furniture in the Holy Place.
[1031]  Whenever we light the lamps in the church meetings, we can see some aspect of Christ.
[1032]  However, if instead of seeing an aspect of Christ, we see something common, natural, or worldly, there must be something wrong with the light.
[1033]  If we would understand any book of the Bible, or any chapter, either in the Old Testament or in the New, we need to know the underlying thought of that book or chapter.
[1034]  We need to know what concept is beneath the surface.
[1035]  In particular, we need to know the underlying thought connecting Exodus 27 and 28.
[1036]  If we are not a spiritual house, we cannot be the priesthood.
[1037]  In like manner, if we are not a body of priests, then we are not God s dwelling place.
[1038]  God created man with a spirit to receive Him as life.
[1039]  According to the second chapter of Genesis, the divine life is presented to man in the form of the tree of life.
[1040]  We can refer to the meeting hall in Anaheim to illustrate how God s building is our protection.
[1041]  Suppose all the materials used in building the meeting hall were still lying on the ground.
[1042]  Then in case of a storm or heavy rain, the materials would be damaged.
[1043]  If we want to be protected, we need to be built into God s building.
[1044]  In the Bible and in the Christian life, life and building are the most basic matters.
[1045]  If we do not allow the Lord to have the building among us, we shall be a failure as far as God s purpose is concerned.

[1047]  According to 28:1-4, the priests were required to wear a particular kind of garment.
[1048]  Today those who serve in the armed forces must wear an appropriate uniform.
[1049]  In the same principle, as a group of serving ones, the priests in the Old Testament had to wear garments that were specially designed for the priests.
[1050]  Exodus 28:4 indicates that these garments included six main items: And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of woven work, a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and for his sons, to serve as priests to Me.
[1051]  FOR GLORY AND FOR BEAUTY The Glory of Christ s Divinity
[1052]  Exodus 28:2 says, And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.
[1053]  The phrase for glory means to express Christ s divinity John 1:14; Heb 1:3; John 17:22 .
[1054]  The phrase for beauty means to express Christ s humanity Luke 24:19 .
[1055]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 4 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:4-14; 39:1-7
[1056]  The priestly garments described in 28:4-14 were first for the high priest and then for the priests.
[1057]  At the time of Exodus 28, the high priest was Aaron, and the priests were the sons of Aaron.
[1058]  In typology Aaron as the high priest signifies Christ as our true High Priest before God, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, are types of the believers.
[1059]  This typifies that we the believers do not have the right to put on what is signified by the ephod.
[1060]  Exodus 28:5 and 6 say, And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen, and they shall make the ephod of gold, blue and purple, scarlet and fine-twined linen, the work of a skillful workman.
[1061]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 5 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:4-14; 39:1-7 ONYX STONES
[1062]  Exodus 28:9-10 says, And you shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: Six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, according to their birth.
[1063]  Adam was made from the dust of the ground.
[1064]  After God created Adam, He placed him in front of the tree of life, from which flowed a river.
[1065]  The ephod was probably a garment that had one opening for the head and two for the arms.
[1066]  I treasure very much the word which the Lord has been releasing from the book of Exodus.
[1067]  This is a book filled with the experiential riches of Christ.
[1068]  Some of the points concerning Christ portrayed in Exodus are beyond our ability to utter.
[1069]  Neither in English nor in my mother tongue do I have the adequate utterance to express what I have seen concerning Christ in this book.
[1070]  In the New Testament we have plain words concerning Christ, our experience of Christ, and the church.
[1071]  There is even a clear word concerning the preciousness of Christ and concerning our value in the sight of God.
[1072]  By the Lord s grace, in this message I shall try to point out some of the wonderful details of the preciousness of Christ and of the preciousness of the saints in the sight of God.
[1073]  From the time of Paul and John in the first century, there have been many different teachings concerning the Person of Christ.
[1074]  In theology there is a special term signifying the study of Christ s Person.
[1075]  Just as theology is the study of God, so Christology is the study of Christ.
[1076]  The six heretical schools are the erroneous teaching of the Docetists, those who claimed that Christ has only divinity, but not humanity; the heresy of the Ebionites, who teach that Christ has only humanity, but not divinity; the erroneous teaching of the Arians, who say that Christ s divinity is not complete and that He was merely the highest among the creatures; the absurd teaching of the Apollinarians, who said that Christ s humanity was not complete; the false doctrine of the Nestorians, who maintained that Christ s divinity and humanity were separated; and the wrong teaching of the Eutychians, who denied the distinctness and coexistence of Christ s divinity and humanity and asserted that these two natures were merged into one.
[1077]  Having seen how the gold and the linen are woven together through a process involving suffering, let us now go on to consider the colors of the ephod.
[1078]  In verse 12 the record goes on to say, And you shall put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.
[1079]  The two onyx stones must have been very close in size to the size of a man s shoulder.
[1080]  The main point in this message, however, is not related to transformation.
[1081]  It is related to how the onyx stones were placed on the shoulder-pieces.
[1082]  The Lord Jesus has the strength to bear us as the onyx stones.
[1083]  This strength comes from His divinity mingled with His humanity and having the expression of God, of man, and of the Lord s heavenliness, kingship, and redemption.
[1084]  We are held to the Lord Jesus by such a marvelous expression.
[1085]  If there were not such an expression in this universe, there would be nothing that could either bear us or fasten us to Christ.
[1086]  The only thing in the universe that can hold us and also fasten us to Christ is the very expression of Christ portrayed by the ephod made of gold, linen, blue, purple, and scarlet.
[1087]  I want to emphasize the fact that this is the expression of Christ as both God and man with His heavenliness, kingship, and redemption.
[1088]  It shall be squared and doubled; a span its length, and a span its width.
[1089]  Here I do not speak of Christ and the church, but of Christ with the church, for we do not have the ephod and the breastplate, but the ephod with the breastplate.
[1090]  Verse 15 indicates this: And you shall make a breastplate of judgment, the work of a skillful workman, like the work of the ephod you shall make it; of gold, blue and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen you shall make it.
[1091]  We have seen that the breastplate was of the same workmanship and material as the ephod and that it was squared and doubled.
[1092]  The breastplate signifies that the church is of the same formation and constituent as Christ and that it is a perfect testimony held in Christ s hand.
[1093]  Now we shall go on to consider the twelve stones on the breastplate.
[1094]  Once again, the number four used here signifies the creatures.
[1095]  Exodus 28:17-20 says, And you shall mount it in mountings of stone, four rows of stone: a row of sardius, topaz, and emerald, the first row; and the second row, a carbuncle, sapphire, and diamond; and the third row, a jacinth, agate, and amethyst; and the fourth row, a chrysolite, and onyx, and jasper.
[1096]  God s way, however, is the most simple way, a way seemingly without artistic beauty, but a way full of spiritual significance.
[1097]  We have seen that on the ephod worn upon the robe of the high priest there were two shoulder-pieces.
[1098]  On the shoulder-pieces were two plates with six of the names of the children of Israel engraved on each plate.
[1099]  On the front of the ephod the high priest wore a breastplate composed of twelve precious stones set in gold.
[1100]  Exodus 28:22 says, And you shall make upon the breastplate twined chains, a work of cords, of pure gold.
[1101]  These two chains of gold signify Christ s divine nature as the connecting element.
[1102]  Verse 25 says, And the two ends of the two cords you shall put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its front.
[1103]  One end of the chains was put on the ends of the breastplate, and the other, on the golden settings of the shoulder-pieces.
[1104]  The two chains put on the two settings of the shoulder-pieces signify Christ s divine nature upholding God s redeemed people, held in His love to His bearing strength.
[1105]  God s redeemed people are held on Christ s heart in His love.
[1106]  In David Baron s book The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew there is an appendix containing an article on the Urim and the Thummim.
[1107]  The breastplate signifies the church with all the believers built up together as one entity.
[1108]  All the transformed believers who are built up to become the one entity known as the Body of Christ, the church, are letters for God s speaking to us.
[1109]  This means that today, in the New Testament age, God speaks to the church through all the saints.
[1110]  If we as God s redeemed people are not transformed, if we do not have Christ inscribed into our being, if we are not built up as one entity, and if we are not connected by Christ s divinity and humanity to His expression, then we do not have the basis for the Urim and the Thummim.
[1111]  According to the appendix in David Baron s book, the Urim had twelve illuminators to enlighten all twelve of the transparent precious stones.
[1112]  But suppose no letters had been inscribed on these stones.
[1113]  Just as God could not speak through the breastplate unless the stones had been inscribed with letters, so God cannot speak through His redeemed people unless they have been inscribed with Christ.
[1114]  According to 28:29 and 30, the breastplate was not only a memorial before the Lord, but was also a plate of judgment.
[1115]  After the Urim and the Thummim were added into the breastplate, it became the breastplate of judgment.
[1116]  Verses 29 and 30 speak of judgment, not of leading or guidance.
[1117]  In this message we shall continue our study of the Urim and the Thummim.
[1118]  Exodus 28:30 says, And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be upon Aaron s heart when he goes in before Jehovah, and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the sons of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually.
[1119]  I believe that the Urim and the Thummim are the most mysterious parts of the garments worn by the high priest.
[1120]  If we would understand the Urim and the Thummim, we should study the Old Testament and also consider our spiritual experience.
[1121]  The Urim and Thummim were later applied to Eleazar, the son of Aaron.
[1122]  After Aaron and Moses died, Joshua came into the position to lead the children of Israel.
[1123]  God, however, did not speak to him as He spoke to Moses.
[1124]  Because David was a godly person, the Lord answered him through the Urim and the Thummim.
[1125]  King Saul, however, was not godly, and he could not receive any answers through the Urim and the Thummim.
[1126]  Thus, the Urim and the Thummim worked for David, but not for Saul.
[1127]  In fact, the time came when God would no longer have anything to do with him.
[1128]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Urim and Thummim were added into the breastplate to make it the breastplate of judgment.
[1129]  We also considered the qualifications of those who used the breastplate and how it was applied to various people in the Old Testament.
[1130]  Furthermore, we saw that the Urim typifies Christ as the illuminator.
[1131]  Christ is the spiritual alphabet for inscription and also for completion.
[1132]  The Christ whom we experience is the One who is inscribed into us.
[1133]  But even though we may have a great deal of Christ inscribed into us, we are still missing something of Christ.
[1134]  In the foregoing messages we pointed out that the Urim is a type of Christ as the illuminator burning with oil, the Spirit, by fire from the altar, the cross.
[1135]  We have also seen that the Thummim typifies Christ as the perfecter.
[1136]  Many Christians today do not have Christ inscribed into them in a clear, definite way.
[1137]  But even if we have the definite experience of Christ and the clear inscription of Christ, we still are not complete.
[1138]  God s way of speaking through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim is the opposite of what we would expect.
[1139]  God speaks not through the stones that are shining, but through stones that become dark.
[1140]  If we as the church would be the breastplate of judgment, we must fulfill certain requirements.
[1141]  Then Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet must be inscribed into us clearly and definitely.
[1142]  Recently a brother testified that often, when the leading ones speak to new ones or young ones about the experience of Christ, these leading ones realize that they themselves do not have the clear and definite experience of Christ.
[1143]  If we do not try to minister Christ to others, we may not realize how short we are concerning the experience of Christ.
[1144]  According to this picture of the priestly garments, Christ holds the church and sustains the church.
[1145]  The breastplate is held by the ephod, and the shoulder-pieces are supported by the ephod.
[1146]  Now we must see that the long skirt signifies the church joined to Christ.
[1147]  Thus far we have covered certain garments worn only by the high priest: the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, the breastplate, and the long robe with the pomegranates and golden bells.
[1148]  The breastplate and shoulder-pieces were attached to the ephod, and the ephod was upon the robe.
[1149]  Underneath the long robe was the tunic, which was the same as that worn by the other priests.
[1150]  Having covered the matters of holiness and righteousness, we must go on to speak concerning the priests themselves.
[1151]  If as a human being you are not a priest serving God, you are not normal.
[1152]  A proper human being is one who is a priest, one who serves God.
[1153]  If a lawyer or a professor does not serve God, he is not a proper person.
[1154]  Exodus 28:39 says, And you shall weave the tunic of fine linen; and you shall make a turban of fine linen; and you shall make a girdle, the work of an embroiderer.
[1155]  Here we have the tunic, the turban, and the girdle.
[1156]  The tunic of fine linen of woven work signifies the covering of perfect righteousness in a humanity that has been dealt with.
[1157]  And you shall clothe Aaron your brother with them, and his sons with him; and you shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, and they shall serve as priests to Me. The tunics signify Christ experienced as beauty; the girdles, Christ experienced as strengthening; and the turbans, Christ expressed as glory.
[1158]  Speaking of the plate of pure gold engraved with the words Holy to Jehovah, Exodus 28:38 says, And it shall be on Aaron s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel shall sanctify for all their holy gifts; and it shall be on his forehead continually that they may be accepted before Jehovah.
[1159]  If we understand this verse properly, we shall see that, in type, it indicates that Christ takes the responsibility to make us holy and to guard for God the holiness that is in us.
[1160]  Christ is guarding, protecting, caring for, the holiness that God has gained among us.
[1161]  As we have pointed out, this involves a fourfold holiness, a series of four steps in which we become more and more holy.
[1162]  Concerning the proper understanding of holiness, I have been helped by the writings of Brother Nee.
[1163]  That word concerning holiness being God s nature led me into a new field of exploration in the Word.
[1164]  We have seen that holiness refers to the nature of God.
[1165]  In this message we come to another section of the book of Exodus.
[1166]  We have covered the tabernacle with its furnishings and also the priestly garments.
[1167]  When God s people were gathered at Mount Sinai, Moses received the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle and the design of the furniture of the tabernacle.
[1168]  Aaron, the high priest, experienced the Passover in Egypt.
[1169]  In relation to the filling up of Aaron s empty hands, the sin offering was the first offering presented to God.
[1170]  In order to have our hands filled with Christ, we need to be washed.
[1171]  What we need for the filling of our hands cannot be given to us if we are unclean.
[1172]  We have seen that the priests needed to be clothed with the priestly garments outwardly and to be filled inwardly with nourishing food.
[1173]  Both the priestly garments and the priestly food signify different aspects of Christ.
[1174]  The trespass offering deals with our sins but the sin offering deals with our sin, that is, with our sinful nature.
[1175]  If we would be priests serving God, we need to realize that even though we have been saved, we still have a sinful nature.
[1176]  We shall continue to have this sinful nature until our body is transfigured.
[1177]  I can testify that no matter how long we have been saved, our sinful nature does not change.
[1178]  Therefore, whenever we come to serve God as priests, we must remember that we have a sinful nature and that we need Christ as our sin offering to deal with this nature.
[1179]  According to 29:1, the sin offering used in sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests was a young bull.
[1180]  This young bull typifies Christ being strong and rich in life.
[1181]  We have seen that Aaron and his sons laying their hands upon the head of the bull signifies the believers being identified with Christ.
[1182]  As we have pointed out, the burning of the fat covering the inwards, the net on the liver and the two kidneys and their fat signifies the riches and sweetness of the inward being of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction.
[1183]  I believe that the Lord wants to speak to us a very sweet word from chapter twenty-nine of Exodus.
[1184]  This portion of the Bible, however, is not easy to understand.
[1185]  According to what is revealed in chapter twenty-nine of Exodus, the priests need to have their hands filled in order to serve God.
[1186]  Their hands should be filled with the fat of the ram of the peace offering, bread, cakes, and wafers.
[1187]  When a priest has his hands filled with the sweetness and riches of Christ, he is different from others.
[1188]  Furthermore, he has the riches of Christ with which to serve God as a priest.
[1189]  The first step in sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests was to wash them.
[1190]  Exodus 29:4 says, And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near unto the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.
[1191]  After Aaron and his sons were washed, they were clothed with the priestly garments.
[1192]  Concerning Aaron verses 5 and 6 say, And you shall take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate; and you shall gird him with the band of the ephod.
[1193]  We have pointed out that remembering that we have a sinful nature and daily offering Christ as our sin offering will protect us and preserve us.
[1194]  The first is the blood sprinkled about the altar.
[1195]  The second matter is the sweet savor ascending to heaven for God s satisfaction.
[1196]  The redeeming blood is sprinkled on the altar on earth, and the savor ascends to the heavens to satisfy God.
[1197]  As our burnt offering for our sanctification as priests, Christ shed His blood for our peace, and He Himself was burned for God s satisfaction.
[1198]  We offer Him in this way because we realize that we have not been for God and that we are not for God.
[1199]  In Exodus 29 the anointing oil is mentioned first in verse 7 and again in verse 21.
[1200]  Verse 7 says, And you shall take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him.
[1201]  This refers to the anointing of Aaron before any of the offerings were slaughtered.
[1202]  According to the New Testament, the goal of God s salvation is to make all those who believe in Christ priests of God.
[1203]  Therefore, if a person is saved but fails to become a priest to serve God, he cannot fulfill God s purpose or satisfy His desire.
[1204]  In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, we see that the redeemed ones are all priests of God.
[1205]  In Revelation 1:5 and 6 we are told that Jesus Christ has loosed us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.
[1206]  When Aaron and his sons were being sanctified to serve God as priests, they first had to realize that they were unclean, they were dirty, and they needed to be cleansed.
[1207]  It is not pleasant to realize that we are dirty and need a thorough cleansing.
[1208]  Physically speaking, uncleanness may come from two sources, one source from within us and the other from outside of us.
[1209]  In Exodus 29 we have not only the bull of the sin offering, but we also have two rams, one for a burnt offering and the other for a peace offering.
[1210]  The burnt offering is different from the sin offering.
[1211]  TO BE THE PRIESTS 6 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:15-28; 40:14-15 REDEMPTION AND GERMINATION
[1212]  We shall begin this message by considering some of the details of the peace offering described in Exodus 29.
[1213]  Verses 19 and 20 say, And you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
[1214]  And you shall slaughter the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron s right ear, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the big toe of their right foot; and you shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
[1215]  Even though the priests had something to offer to God, they did not yet have anything to eat themselves.
[1216]  In verse 26 the Lord said to Moses, And you shall take the breast from the ram of the filling of hand which is for Aaron, and wave it as a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be your portion.
[1217]  In Exodus 29 we have a negative picture of what we are without Christ and outside of Christ.
[1218]  Apart from Christ we are unclean, naked, sinful, empty, and without anything to satisfy God or ourselves.
[1219]  Although they have been saved, many Christians, under the influence of superficial preaching and teaching, do not know the goal of their salvation.
[1220]  From Exodus 29 we see that we have been saved so that we may be sanctified to serve God as priests.
[1221]  Chapter twenty-eight is on the priestly garments, and chapter twenty-nine is mainly on the priests food.
[1222]  Not only does 29:29-46 give us a conclusion of these chapters; it also presents a brief sketch concerning the priests garments and their food and also God s food.
[1223]  In this message we come to 29:29-46, the conclusion of chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine.
[1224]  Even though we may now understand the steps in sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests, we may not understand how to apply these steps to the conclusion.
[1225]  In other words, we may not realize that these chapters have a goal.
[1226]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS
[1227]  We have pointed out that 29:29-46 is a brief sketch of chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine of Exodus.
[1228]  The first aspect of this sketch consists of statutes concerning the holy garments of the high priests.
[1229]  Verse 30 says that the high priest who serves in Aaron s stead must wear the holy garments seven days when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
[1230]  I have spent much time to understand the meaning of this verse.
[1231]  This verse means that whenever we touch the service of God, even if only for a day, we need to wear the priestly garments for seven days.
[1232]  Therefore, when we touch the service of God, we need to wear Christ in various aspects for a full course of time.
[1233]  When we come to a meeting, perhaps on the Lord s Day, we may have the desire to serve God as priests.
[1234]  According to verse 31, the flesh of this ram was boiled in a holy place.
[1235]  Remember that the Passover lamb had to be burned, not boiled.
[1236]  Anything offered to God for His enjoyment must be judged by Him; that is, it must be burned by His holy fire.
[1237]  We have seen a clear picture of the steps by which Aaron and his sons were sanctified to serve God as priests.
[1238]  First they were washed, then they were clothed, and after that they were satisfied by having their emptiness filled.
[1239]  In a foregoing message we pointed out that, according to Exodus 28 and 29, God wants us to invite Him for dinner.
[1240]  However, we, the hosts, the ones who invite the Lord to dinner, are sinners.
[1241]  Therefore, before God can come to have dinner with us, our sinful nature must be dealt with.
[1242]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that if we would be brought into oneness with God, we need to offer the sin offering.
[1243]  This offering is not actually food for God in a direct way.
[1244]  Verses 38 through 41 speak of offering two lambs every day as food directly for God.
[1245]  Verse 38 says, And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually.
[1246]  According to verse 39, one lamb was to be offered in the morning, and the other lamb, in the evening.
[1247]  With each lamb there was an offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering v. 40 . The lambs with the flour, the oil, and the wine were offered to God by priests who had been washed, clothed, and satisfied.
[1248]  I have learned that due to certain situations, many young people in China have been deprived of a proper education.
[1249]  Likewise, many of today s Christians have been deprived of the proper spiritual education.
[1250]  Many preachers are eloquent, knowledgeable, and capable, but they are shallow.
[1251]  In the foregoing messages we have seen that with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve God as priests, there were four important points.
[1252]  Three of these points are related to the priests, and one is related to God.
[1253]  The groceries used in preparing God s food involved three items of the animal life a bull and two lambs and three of the plant life flour, oil, and wine.
[1254]  According to Exodus 29, God s food consists of two lambs, a meal offering containing flour and oil, and a drink offering of wine.
[1255]  In the morning one lamb was offered to God with the meal offering and the drink offering, and in the evening, the other lamb was offered to Him, also with the meal offering and the drink offering.
[1256]  Let us now go on to consider the lambs, the flour, the oil, and the wine offered to God as food.
[1257]  I would emphasize the fact that if we would raise Christ as a lamb, we must first have Him as the sin offering.
[1258]  Offering Christ as the sin offering is the way to raise Christ as a lamb.
[1259]  Revelation 14:1 says, And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
[1260]  Exodus 29:38-40 says, And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually.
[1261]  The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer between the evenings; and with the one lamb a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
[1262]  In typology, or in figure, a lamb signifies Christ as the One obedient to God and meek before men.
[1263]  The more we raise Christ and grow Christ, the more we shall have Him as the animal life and the vegetable life in the church meetings.
[1264]  Then we shall be rich in spiritual groceries, for we shall have Christ as the bull for a sin offering, as the lamb for a burnt offering, and as the grain that produces life and supplies life.
[1265]  In the church meetings we need to forget the past religious and traditional practices.
[1266]  If we do not have a reserve of Christ as the animal life, how shall we be able to continue offering Christ as the bull for a sin offering and as the lamb for a burnt offering?
[1267]  Therefore, although we cannot raise many Christs, because Christ is uniquely one, nevertheless in our experience we can raise Christ as a herd and as a flock so that we may have the reserve that will enable us to offer Him to God continually.
[1268]  In other words, how can we grow Christ as an olive tree?
[1269]  We grow Him as an olive tree and produce olive oil by always exercising our mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit, and by using this mingled spirit.
[1270]  We need to be deeply impressed with the significance of all the types in the Old Testament.
[1271]  In particular, we need to have a proper understanding of the daily offerings for the sanctification of the priests.
[1272]  Every day for a period of seven days there was the need of a bull for a sin offering, two lambs for burnt offerings, one offered in the morning and the other in the evening, and along with the lambs a meal offering and a drink offering.
[1273]  We have a bull for a sin offering, lambs for a burnt offering, oil and flour for a meal offering, and wine for a drink offering.
[1274]  As you ponder these things, do you not have the feeling that they are meaningful and significant?
[1275]  In the foregoing message we emphasized the value of the types in the Old Testament, and we also considered different attitudes toward these types.
[1276]  In particular, we need to pay attention to the types of Christ presented in Exodus 29.
[1277]  If we apply this picture of Christ to our experience, we shall enjoy more of Christ and learn how to grow Christ and produce Him so that we can offer Him to God in the church meetings.
[1278]  Because it is somewhat difficult to understand these matters and practice them, let me try to explain further what I mean.
[1279]  I do not mean that you should do anything in a legal way.
[1280]  The Lord is living and present, and we love Him.
[1281]  If you come to the church meeting with Christ in these aspects, you will not come in a traditional way, in a common way, in a way according to the religious background.
[1282]  No, the way you come to the meetings and function in the meetings will be absolutely different.
[1283]  I do not know what you will do, but I believe that spontaneously you will offer praise to the Lord and testify of Him.
[1284]  This means that if we are filled with Christ, we shall pour Him forth in praise and testimony.
[1285]  After so many messages on chapter twenty-nine, we come now to a wonderful matter in chapter thirty the golden incense altar 30:1-5 .
[1286]  In studying the types in the Old Testament, especially in the books of Exodus and Leviticus, the most difficult thing is to see how to apply these types to our daily Christian life.
[1287]  It is not so difficult to study the types in a doctrinal way or to understand them in a doctrinal way.
[1288]  According to the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, the ark is the focus.
[1289]  However, in actual practice the center is the incense altar.
[1290]  The picture portrayed in the Bible as a whole corresponds to the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court.
[1291]  There is one book in the Bible that can be regarded as representing the entire Bible.
[1292]  Speaking of the Word, which was with God and which is God, John 1:3 says, All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.
[1293]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Gospel of John may be regarded as representative of the entire Bible.
[1294]  In this Gospel we have creation, the tabernacle, and the various items found in the outer court and in the tabernacle: the altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar.
[1295]  The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people Rom 8:34; Heb 7:25 .
[1296]  Therefore, for the maintaining of our relationship with God, we need prayer not only from Christ individually, but also from His Body corporately.
[1297]  I am quite burdened concerning the incense altar because some of the points related to it are rather new to us.
[1298]  Thus, it will take time for us to enter into the depths of the truth with respect to the incense altar.
[1299]  The picture of the tabernacle portrays Christ as the incarnated God who is available for us to enter.
[1300]  This very Christ is also all the offerings to qualify us by opening the way into God and by filling us inwardly.
[1301]  In the previous message we emphasized three important matters related to the incense altar.
[1302]  First, when we pray, we need to be in the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated God.
[1303]  Second, in order to pray at the incense altar, we must first be filled and satisfied by eating the holy food, our portion of the offerings.
[1304]  Third, when we pray, we should offer incense to God.
[1305]  Instead of being occupied in prayer with material needs or personal concerns, we shall pray for the executing of God s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God s supplying grace.
[1306]  If you were to stay with me for a period of several days, you would learn that I am a person who much of the time is not happy.
[1307]  The situation of today s Christians makes me very sad.
[1308]  Consider the people around you and what they are doing.
[1309]  Because the two altars are connected, the psalmist speaks of them together: Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God Psa 84:3 .
[1310]  This is especially interesting when we realize that in God s dwelling place there were other furnishings and utensils, such as the ark, the table, and the lampstand.
[1311]  May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see that the proper and genuine prayer life is in God and requires that God be in us; that it is one with the resurrected and ascended Christ as our incense to God; and that it is linked to the crucified Christ by the blood, the fire, and the sweet savor.
[1312]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE THE GOLDEN INCENSE ALTAR 5 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:6-10, 26-28; 40:5, 26-27; Psa 84:3; 141:2; Rev 8:3-6 CHRIST INTERCEDING
[1313]  The deepest type of the types in the Old Testament may be the incense altar in Exodus 30.
[1314]  If we consider this type even superficially, we shall see that it is related to prayer.
[1315]  Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament incense offered to God signifies our prayer to Him.
[1316]  Therefore, in our reading of the Bible, we can realize that the golden altar of incense must in some way be related to prayer.
[1317]  If we consider this matter in a deeper way, we shall see that actually the incense altar does not refer to our prayer.
[1318]  First the blood of the sin offering was shed at the altar in the outer court.
[1319]  Then it was brought to the incense altar and sprinkled on it.
[1320]  Our sight is versus Christ as our light the lampstand .
[1321]  Our conduct, our sight, and our virtue together equal our natural being, which is versus Christ as God s testimony the ark .
[1322]  Instead, we pray for God s economy, we pray for God s dispensation, we pray for God s move, we pray for God s recovery, and we pray for the churches and the saints.
[1323]  After we have gone to the altar of burnt offering, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we arrive at the golden altar of incense.
[1324]  When we come to this altar, our unique taste, our only interest, is to pray.
[1325]  This is true both of the prayers at the first altar and at the second.
[1326]  The kind of prayer we have depends on the kind of person we are, for our prayers reveal our person.
[1327]  In this message we come to a new item the propitiation silver.
[1328]  Actually, the matter of the propitiation silver is not simple.
[1329]  In order to see into the depths of the truth related to the propitiation silver, we need to find out the reason this item is mentioned in Exodus 30 immediately after the record concerning the incense altar.
[1330]  If we take a bird s-eye view of this item according to these five questions, we shall see that the propitiation silver was not the redemption for all the children of Israel; it was not a ransom for all the common people.
[1331]  Unlike the Passover lamb, it was not the ransom paid for everyone.
[1332]  We have emphasized the fact that in Egypt all the children of Israel, from the youngest to the oldest, both male and female, were redeemed.
[1333]  In order for the children of Israel to express God, they first had to come to the altar in the outer court to confess their sins and their sin.
[1334]  God is interested in how much we live Christ, express Christ, and have Christ constituted into our being.
[1335]  In the previous message we began to consider the matter of the propitiation silver in 30:11-16.
[1336]  Exodus 30:12 speaks of the sum, or the census, of the sons of Israel according to those who are numbered, and verse 16 speaks of taking the propitiation silver from the sons of Israel and giving it for the service of the tent of meeting.
[1337]  We have pointed out that, in order to understand the significance of the propitiation silver, we need to ask several important questions.
[1338]  In answer to the first question, we have seen that the prayer, the intercession, at the incense altar is for God s move, that God s move requires an army that can fight for His interests, and that for the formation of His army a census is necessary.
[1339]  As God s chosen people, we all have been redeemed, no matter what our age may be, spiritually speaking.
[1340]  However, we need to ask ourselves what our spiritual age is according to our maturity.
[1341]  Perhaps your spiritual age is only a few weeks or a few years.
[1342]  But less than a third, 603,550 to be exact, were qualified to be in God s army.
[1343]  More than two-thirds of God s people, all the females and the males under the age of twenty, could not be numbered in this military census.
[1344]  The spiritual significance of this is that if we would be in the army to fight for God s move, we need to mature.
[1345]  If the Lord s recovery is to move on, a number of saints need to experience all the aspects of the outer court and the tabernacle.
[1346]  They must go to the altar and then enjoy Christ as their life supply at the table in the Holy Place.
[1347]  Then they need to receive Christ as their light and experience the breaking of their natural being in order to have the ark, Christ as the testimony of God.
[1348]  Furthermore, apart from the propitiation silver, there was no way for God s dwelling place to move.
[1349]  The propitiation silver provided the material for the sockets, the caps, the hooks, and the fillets of the pillars.
[1350]  The propitiation silver was also related to the numbering of the males twenty years of age and over to be drafted to form the army to fight for God s move on earth.
[1351]  Now we need to go on to find out why the rich and the poor alike were to pay a half-shekel.
[1352]  The rich were not required to pay more, and the poor were not allowed to pay less.
[1353]  Verse 15 says, The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give the heave offering of Jehovah to make propitiation for your souls.
[1354]  A proper meeting, a meeting that is living, rich, and balanced, is one in which each one pays the half-shekel.
[1355]  But the situation today is that certain rich ones may put in millions of shekels, whereas most of the Christians do not pay anything at all.
[1356]  This is the situation of today s Christians, and it may also be the situation among us.
[1357]  In this message we shall consider the laver of bronze described in 30:17-21.
[1358]  We may not realize how important the laver is.
[1359]  But it is crucial that we discover the significance of this item.
[1360]  The service of the priests in the outer court and in the tabernacle depended on their washing in the laver.
[1361]  No one would go several days without washing his hands.
[1362]  When we pray to offer something to the Lord, we first need to wash our hands and even our feet in the laver.
[1363]  The bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty rebellious ones who were judged by God.
[1364]  After these rebellious ones were judged, the Lord said to Moses, Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
[1365]  The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel Num 16:37-38 .
[1366]  Therefore, the bronze used to overlay the altar became a reminder of God s judgment on rebellion.
[1367]  This oil is a compound of four spices blended with oil.
[1368]  The first thing we need to see is the position of this ointment in the divine record in Exodus.
[1369]  The compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle with all its furniture, the altar with all its utensils, the laver with its base, and the priests 30:26-30 .
[1370]  This ointment signifies God, who is triune, after a long process becoming the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people to be one with them.
[1371]  It certainly was good for the children of Israel to enjoy the Passover, the manna from heaven, and the water from the rock.
[1372]  The anointing oil signifies that now the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can reach His chosen and regenerated people to be one with them.
[1373]  In this message we shall consider the details related to the holy anointing oil in 30:22-33.
[1374]  In the Bible olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.
[1375]  The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God, through the pressure of Christ s death, flowing out.
[1376]  The five hundred shekels of myrrh signify one unit of full responsibility.
[1377]  We may use the human hand as an illustration.
[1378]  Exodus 30:31 says, And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.
[1379]  Even in eternity God will continually be anointing us.
[1380]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:22-33 THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE
[1381]  When I was young, I heard many messages from the book of Exodus.
[1382]  I often heard about the Passover lamb and the manna, and I heard a few messages about the living water.
[1383]  However, I did not hear anything concerning the compound spirit.
[1384]  Some teachers pointed out that the law was given as God s test of His people.
[1385]  John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[1386]  This means that before the Lord s glorification the compound Spirit was not yet.
[1387]  The Spirit of God was present in Genesis 1, and the Holy Spirit was involved with the birth of Christ.
[1388]  For Christ to be conceived of the Holy Spirit means that His humanity, as part of God s creation, is holy.
[1389]  The five elements of the anointing oil the four spices and the olive oil all had to pass through a process that involved either pressure or cutting.
[1390]  For instance, if olives are not put into the press, they cannot give forth olive oil.
[1391]  In Romans 8 there are at least four terms used to describe the Spirit: the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead.
[1392]  The crucial aspect in this chapter is the Spirit of Christ.
[1393]  As God s anointed One, Christ passed through birth, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[1394]  Applying this principle to the Spirit of Christ, we may say that the extracts of Christ s birth, living, death, resurrection, and ascension are now all elements of the Spirit of Christ.
[1395]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THE COMPOUNDED OINTMENT
[1396]  THE COMPOUND SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:23-30; Gen 1:2; Judg.
[1397]  The holy anointing oil described in 30:23-30 is a compound ointment.
[1398]  For example, the Passover was an enjoyment for the children of Israel.
[1399]  It was a feast that eventually was made an ordinance.
[1400]  Some may complain that to say that the numbers three and five signify the Triune God in resurrection bearing responsibility for His people and that these numbers are related to God s building is too much allegorization of the Word.
[1401]  However, what they regard as allegorization is simply recognizing what is revealed in the Bible.
[1402]  We may compare this allegorization to reading and pronouncing a word.
[1403]  In the Bible we have thirteen titles of the Spirit of God: the Spirit of God Rom 8:9, 14; 1 Cor 2:14 ; the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the Lord Acts 5:9; 8:39; 2 Cor 3:17 ; the Holy Spirit Acts 16:6; Rom 15:13, 16 ; the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13 ; the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 ; the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 ; the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 : the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 ; the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:6 ; the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 ; the Spirit of grace Heb 10:29 ; the seven Spirits Rev 1:4 ; and the Spirit Rom 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal 3:14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 2:7; 14:13; 22:17 .
[1404]  After God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM and told him to tell the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you, He went on to say to him, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations v. 15 . In 3:14 God says, I AM hath sent me unto you, but in the next verse He says, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you.
[1405]  However, the King James Version does not make this fact clear in its translation of Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11.
[1406]  Thy Holy Spirit in Psalm 51:11 should be the Spirit of Thy holiness, and his Holy Spirit in Isaiah 63:10 and 11 should be the Spirit of His holiness.
[1407]  The title the Holy Spirit was first used with respect to Christ s incarnation, to the time when the Spirit came to Mary to conceive the Lord Jesus.
[1408]  According to Luke 1:35, the angel said to Mary, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.
[1409]  After the Lord s resurrection, His word concerning the Spirit as another Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, was fulfilled.
[1410]  He had said that He would pray that the Father would give us another Comforter, and that this One would be the Spirit of reality who would be in us.
[1411]  Then the Lord went on to say that in that day we would know that He is in the Father, that we are in Him, and that He is in us.
[1412]  The coming of the Spirit of reality was actually Christ s coming, for Christ is this Spirit.
[1413]  Romans 8:2 says, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[1414]  Actually, it goes without saying that the Spirit of life contains the element of the divine life.
[1415]  With the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.
[1416]  When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit Rom 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal 3:14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 2:7; 14:13; 22:17 .
[1417]  First Peter 4:14 says, If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
[1418]  The Spirit of glory is not related as much to the nature of God as other aspects of the Spirit are.
[1419]  The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of incarnation, humanity, human living, and crucifixion.
[1420]  In particular, it is the aspect of the Spirit that includes the Lord s sufferings.
[1421]  The entire life of the Lord Jesus from birth to burial was a life of suffering.
[1422]  In Romans 1:4 Paul refers to the Spirit of holiness: And was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[1423]  The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in Romans 1:3.
[1424]  As the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the divine essence of Christ, which is the fullness of the Godhead Col 2:9 .
[1425]  This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself John 4:24 , is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.
[1426]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THE INGREDIENTS OF THE COMPOUND SPIRIT
[1427]  We have seen that the compounded ointment is a type of the compound Spirit.
[1428]  In this message and in the two messages following we shall first consider the ingredients of the compound Spirit, and then we shall consider the function of the compound Spirit.
[1429]  THE INGREDIENTS OF THE COMPOUND SPIRIT The Only God the One Hin of Olive Oil
[1430]  What are the ingredients, the elements, that constitute the compound Spirit?
[1431]  In Hebrew measurement, a hin is a complete unit.
[1432]  Next in the ingredients of the compound Spirit we have man, the creature of God.
[1433]  This, of course, refers to the humanity of Jesus, or to the Man Jesus.
[1434]  When some hear that man, the creature of God, is an ingredient of the compound Spirit as typified by the compounded ointment, they may say, There is nothing said here about man.
[1435]  We have seen that the first three ingredients of the compound Spirit typified by the compounded ointment are the only God, the Triune God, and the man Jesus, typified respectively by the one hin of olive oil, the three units of the measure of the four spices, and the four spices of the plant life.
[1436]  After we experience the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, we are ushered into resurrection.
[1437]  For example, suppose a sister experiences the effectiveness of Christ s death applied to her shopping.
[1438]  The numbers three and five indicate that the building element is also included in the compound Spirit.
[1439]  Here we have three complete units of five hundred shekels each.
[1440]  TYPIFIED BY THE COMPOUNDED OINTMENT 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:23-30; 1 John 2:18-27; 4:2-3
[1441]  The ingredients of the Spirit include the unique God, the Triune God, the humanity of Jesus, the precious death of Christ, the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, the precious resurrection of Christ, the power of Christ s resurrection, the mingling of divinity with humanity, the power for responsibility, and the building element.
[1442]  We have seen that the anointing of the compound Spirit is to anoint the believers with the Father and the Son, conveyed in the anointing Spirit, and to anoint the believers with the eternal life conveyed in this Spirit.
[1443]  In verse 24 John says, That which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you.
[1444]  In verse 27 John also points out that His anointing teaches you concerning all things.
[1445]  We may interpret this in a general way as I did for many years and regard all things as referring to all the things in our daily living the way we dress, cut our hair, spend our money, and our attitude toward others.
[1446]  But strictly speaking all things refers to Jesus Christ, the Father, the Son, and eternal life.
[1447]  In this message we shall give a further word on 1 John 2:22-27 in relation to the compound Spirit typified by the compounded ointment described in Exodus 30.
[1448]  The Bible reveals that the Son is called the Father Isa 9:6 and that He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .
[1449]  Consider the revelation of the Triune God in chapter fourteen of John.
[1450]  Apparently surprised at Philip s request, the Lord Jesus answered, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not know Me, Philip?
[1451]  How is it that you say, Show us the Father? v. 9 . Then the Lord went on to say, Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? Here the Lord seems to be saying, Philip, have I been with you so long and still you don t know Me? Don t you realize that when you see Me, you see the Father? I am one with the Father.
[1452]  Jesus is the Man, the Redeemer, and the Savior.
[1453]  We have seen that in this ointment there are ten ingredients: the only God, typified by the one hin of olive oil; the Triune God, signified by the three units of the measure of the four spices; the Man Jesus, a creature of God with respect to His humanity, typified by the four spices of the plant life; the precious death of Christ, typified by the flowing myrrh; the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, signified by the fragrant cinnamon; the precious resurrection of Christ, indicated by the fragrant calamus; the power of Christ s resurrection, typified by the repellent cassia; the mingling of divinity with humanity, seen in the blending of the olive oil with the four spices; the power for responsibility, shown by the five elements of the compounded ointment and the three times five hundred shekels of the four spices; and the building element, seen in the numbers five and three.
[1454]  Toward the end of the section concerned with the revelation of the tabernacle two things are described: the anointing oil and the incense.
[1455]  I believe that in the foregoing messages we have considered thoroughly the matter of the anointing oil.
[1456]  We have seen that this oil is a fine and all-inclusive type of Christ being the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[1457]  This indicates that God smells our prayer rather than sees it.
[1458]  In one of the messages on the golden incense altar we pointed out that the incense altar is the administrative center of God s plan.
[1459]  This plan, this economy, is carried out by means of an administration.
[1460]  In the foregoing message we saw the two-way traffic between God and us portrayed by the ointment and the incense.
[1461]  Where do we see humanity signified by the ingredients of the incense?
[1462]  Humanity is indicated by the number four implied in verse 34.
[1463]  Here we have three spices and pure frankincense, a total of four items.
[1464]  What is the element of the salt with which we are salted?
[1465]  We saw that the ointment typifies God coming to us in Christ and through Christ, and the incense typifies our going to God in Christ and through Christ.
[1466]  In the second message on the incense we pointed out that with both the ointment and the incense we see the Triune God, divinity, humanity, and Christ s death and resurrection.
[1467]  In the previous message we strongly emphasized our need to have our prayers purified by the salt so that we may offer fragrant incense to God for His satisfaction.
[1468]  As the third element in the incense, galbanum signifies the powerful death of Christ s generating life.
[1469]  Fat signifies that Christ lived a life that was absolutely for God.
[1470]  While He lived such a life absolutely for God, Christ wept for those who were not for God.
[1471]  According to 30:34, there shall be an equal part of each.
[1472]  This means that there was to be an equal proportion of each of the four basic elements.
[1473]  This signifies that all the attributes of Christ s death and resurrection are even.
[1474]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THE WORKERS OF THE TABERNACLE,
[1475]  THE FURNITURE, AND THE PRIESTLY GARMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 31:1-11; 35:10-19, 30 36:2
[1476]  In this message we shall begin to consider the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garments, as described in 31:1-11; 35:10-19, 30-36:2.
[1477]  After studying them, I realize that not even in the New Testament do we have such a detailed picture showing us how to build up God s dwelling place.
[1478]  Concerning Bezalel, 31:3 says, And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship.
[1479]  If we would build God s dwelling place, we must be a people filled with the Spirit of God.
[1480]  By our natural life and ability and in our natural man, we are not able to do this work.
[1481]  In the foregoing message we began to consider the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garment.
[1482]  We saw that in the book of Exodus the master builder was Bezalel, who was filled with the Spirit of God in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all workmanship.
[1483]  We emphasized the fact that the building up of God s dwelling place, the church, is a noble work to be done by all the saints.
[1484]  Because this work cannot be done in our natural life or natural ability, we all need to be filled with the Spirit of God in knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and workmanship.
[1485]  Verse 6 speaks of Bezalel s co-master builder: And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan The name Oholiab means the tent or tabernacle of my father.
[1486]  This signifies that one s whole person cares for God s tabernacle.
[1487]  Ahisamach, the name of Oholiab s father, means a brother of strength or support.
[1488]  This co-master worker was a man for the tabernacle of God with strength and support.
[1489]  In 31:7-11 we have a list of the things built.
[1490]  Verses 7 through 9 say, The tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory cover which is upon it, and all the utensils of the tent; and the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand and all its utensils, and the altar of incense; and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its base.
[1491]  We have already covered the details concerning all these items.
[1492]  Here it is sufficient to point out that the ark of the testimony is Christ as God s testimony, that the table indicates that Christ is the life supply in the tabernacle to the serving priests, that the golden lampstand indicates that Christ is the light of life inside the dwelling place of God, and that the altar of incense indicates that Christ is the Intercessor to whom we should join to offer to God the incense of the salted prayer.
[1493]  Furthermore, to experience the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils means that we experience Christ as all the offerings offered to God for us on the cross.
[1494]  In 31:12-17, after a long record concerning the building up of God s dwelling place, there is a repetition of the commandment to keep the Sabbath.
[1495]  We need to find out why this particular commandment is repeated after the record concerning the full revelation of God s dwelling place.
[1496]  The last verse of chapter thirty-one, verse 18, tells us that the Lord gave to Moses two tablets of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
[1497]  Then after a full enjoyment with Him and of Him, we may work together with Him.
[1498]  Yes, we should work with God and even by God.
[1499]  If we do not know how to enjoy God and be filled with God, we shall not know how to work with Him, how to be one with Him in His work.
[1500]  We all need to learn a basic lesson regarding the Sabbath.
[1501]  When I was young, I argued with others about which day, the eighth day or the seventh, should be kept as the Sabbath.
[1502]  Now I would say that that kind of argument is altogether a waste.
[1503]  The Sabbath day sanctifies us, designates us, marks us out.
[1504]  When we enjoy the Lord and then work with Him, for Him, and by being one with Him, spontaneously we are sanctified.
[1505]  I believe that we all are familiar with the story in Exodus concerning the breaking of the law.
[1506]  In this message we shall seek to find out the principles implied in this story.
[1507]  In the past we have pointed out that in studying the Bible, a basic need is to touch the spirit of the writer expressed in his writing.
[1508]  Now we come to the breaking of the law 32:1-20 .
[1509]  Why is it that we human beings cannot keep the law, but break it instead?
[1510]  If we have God and allow no idols to replace Him, the very God whom we enjoy will become to us the ability to keep His commandments.
[1511]  Another principle related to idolatry is that idolatry is Satan s usurping of what God has given us in order to make it a waste.
[1512]  In Exodus 32 the children of Israel wasted much of the gold that had been given to them by God.
[1513]  Before the children of Israel left Egypt, God caused the Egyptians to give the children of Israel gold and other precious things.
[1514]  Another principle related to idols is that here there is mixture in worship.
[1515]  This principle can be applied to today s Christians.
[1516]  Many Christians worship a calf, but they think that they are worshipping the Lord Jesus or the true God.
[1517]  As we have seen, idolatry involves five principles: self-beautification, Satan s usurping God s gifts and making them a waste, the worship of the things we enjoy, pretending to worship the true God, and mixture in worship.
[1518]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in reading chapter thirty-two of Exodus we need to find out the principles implied in this record.
[1519]  Before we go on to consider the matter of the dealing with the idol and the idolaters, we need to consider the principle of the golden-calf idol.
[1520]  Although there were idol worshippers in Genesis, the worship of the idol in Exodus 32 is unique.
[1521]  It is important for us to see that the worship of the golden calf in Exodus 32 was a mixture.
[1522]  It was an idol that was worshipped, but it was worshipped in the way that God s people were supposed to worship God.
[1523]  This is a common practice among many Christians today.
[1524]  Christians may worship in the way that is suitable to the worship of God, but actually the object of their worship may be something other than God.
[1525]  Something that pretends to be God is worshipped as if it were actually God Himself.
[1526]  The golden-calf idol is different from a pagan idol.
[1527]  It is difficult to describe this golden-calf idol.
[1528]  Perhaps we may say that the golden calf in Exodus 32 is a made-by-God s-redeemed-people idol.
[1529]  Only a God-redeemed people, those who were redeemed by the blood of the Passover lamb, who were brought out of Egypt, and who enjoyed the miracles of God, even while they were making the idol, were the ones to make a golden calf.
[1530]  The people also abused what God had given them and used it for their amusement and entertainment.
[1531]  The worship of the golden calf was a kind of amusement and entertainment.
[1532]  In the foregoing messages we considered the breaking of the law and the principle of the golden-calf idol.
[1533]  Now we shall go on to see how Moses dealt with the idol and with the idolaters.
[1534]  MOSES PETITION FOR THE IDOLATROUS PEOPLE Jehovah s Word regarding the Idolatrous People
[1535]  Get down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves v. 7 . God specifically told Moses that the people had corrupted themselves.
[1536]  Concerning the idolatrous people, the Lord went on to tell Moses, They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have bowed themselves down to it and have sacrificed to it; and they said, This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt v. 8 . The children of Israel had been under God s dealings and training for approximately a year.
[1537]  In verse 20 we see how Moses dealt with the golden-calf idol: And he took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire, and ground it until it was powder; and he scattered it upon the surface of the water, and made the sons of Israel drink it.
[1538]  Aaron said that the calf came out of the fire v. 24 . Aaron had used fire to shape the golden calf.
[1539]  In this message we come to the record of a very particular matter, a record that reveals that Moses was a companion of God 32:30 33:23 .
[1540]  The making of the golden calf was a severe blow to both God and Moses.
[1541]  At this point I would like to say to all the saints, especially the young people, that to serve the Lord is not simply a matter of a way or a method.
[1542]  If we would serve the Lord, we must be a person who has an intimate relationship with Him.
[1543]  Otherwise, we may be good Christian workers, but we cannot be those who are able to touch God s heart.
[1544]  In previous messages we have seen how Moses was raised up by God and trained by Him.
[1545]  The record in the book of Exodus gives many details concerning the person of Moses.
[1546]  According to this record, before the first forty days Moses spent on the mountain with God, his relationship with God was not yet one of intimacy.
[1547]  But in the incident of the making of the golden calf, we see that Moses and God had an intimate talk.
[1548]  This indicates the beginning of Moses intimacy with God.
[1549]  At this juncture the Bible recognizes that Moses was a companion of God.
[1550]  Exodus 33:11 says, And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his companion.
[1551]  The Hebrew word rendered companion here is different from the word for friend used with respect to Abraham in 2 Chronicles 20:7 and Isaiah 41:8.
[1552]  As a friend of God, Abraham had been separated from idolatrous people Josh 24:2-3 , and he interceded for Lot Gen 18:16-33 .
[1553]  Not only was Abraham justified by God, but he also became a friend of God.
[1554]  In the foregoing message we saw that Moses was not only a friend of God, but also a companion, an associate, of God.
[1555]  Moses sought to make propitiation for the people even at the risk of his eternal destiny.
[1556]  According to verse 32, he said to the Lord, And now, if You will forgive their sin and if not, wipe me out, I pray, from Your book which You have written.
[1557]  Notice that Moses did not complete the first part of his statement.
[1558]  Exodus 33:1-3 say, And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it and I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite , unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of you, because you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way.
[1559]  This indicates that the conversation between the two partners, the Lord and Moses, had arrived at an agreement.
[1560]  God, the first party, agreed to let the offenders go, but He still insisted that He would deal with the people at a later time.
[1561]  FOR HIS PRESENCE AND GLORY For God s Presence to Go with His People
[1562]  In 33:12-17 we see that Moses bargained with God for His presence His face to go with the people He had set apart as the way for them to take.
[1563]  In verses 12 and 13 Moses said to the Lord, See, You are saying to me, Bring up this people, but You have not let me know whom You will send with me; and yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My eyes.
[1564]  And now, I pray, if I have found favor in Your eyes, let me know, I pray, Your way, that I may know You, so that I may find favor in Your eyes; and consider that this nation is Your people.
[1565]  Although Moses did not make known his request altogether clearly in words, God understood him.
[1566]  Exodus 34 is a chapter that is not easy to understand.
[1567]  After we read through this chapter, we still may not be able to grasp what is spoken in it, because so many matters are covered.
[1568]  Therefore, at the beginning of this message I would like to point out two matters that may help our understanding of this chapter.
[1569]  The first is that when we, the New Testament believers, read the Old Testament, especially certain books, we need to realize that in the Old Testament there are types, figures, and shadows of the divine and spiritual things revealed in the New Testament.
[1570]  Verses 4 and 5 say, And he hewed two tablets of stone like the first ones; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai as Jehovah had commanded him, and he took in his hands two tablets of stone.
[1571]  And Jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
[1572]  In these verses we see that Moses went up to Mount Sinai, and the Lord descended to Mount Sinai.
[1573]  Hence, to Moses it was a matter of going up, but to God it was a matter of coming down.
[1574]  Before God did anything, He first gave Moses a warning by declaring His name v. 6 . For God to declare His name means that He assumed His position.
[1575]  He would never leave His position, but He would keep it by declaring who He is.
[1576]  When Moses heard this declaration, he hastened and bowed his head toward the earth, and bowed himself down v. 8 .
[1577]  After declaring His name, the Lord went on to say, Behold, I am making a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels which have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in all the nations; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Jehovah, for it is a fearful thing which I am doing with you.
[1578]  In this message we shall consider the charge related to feasting and resting with the Lord.
[1579]  In verse 18 the Lord says, You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
[1580]  These are two matters for us to enjoy today.
[1581]  Let us now go on to consider 34:23 and 24: Three times in the year every male shall appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
[1582]  For I will dispossess the nations from before you and enlarge your borders, and no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before Jehovah your God three times in the year.
[1583]  In these verses we have a very crucial matter indicated by the word for at the beginning of verse 24.
[1584]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MOSES STAY WITH GOD 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 34
[1585]  In the previous message we considered the matter of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him.
[1586]  In this message we shall go on to consider the five conditions that must be fulfilled in order for us to feast with the Lord.
[1587]  This signifies that our natural man must be replaced with Christ so that we may live a sanctified life for God.
[1588]  A third condition of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him is found in the second part of verse 25: Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover remain until the morning.
[1589]  What is the significance of not allowing the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover to remain until the morning?
[1590]  This signifies that we should enjoy the riches of Christ in this age and not leave them until the next age.
[1591]  In order that we may be deeply impressed with these conditions, especially with the sequence in which they are presented, let me say a further word concerning them.
[1592]  Not only is every condition meaningful, but the sequence of the five conditions is particularly meaningful.
[1593]  The first condition is that of redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb.
[1594]  This indicates that if we would enjoy the Lord, we need to realize that we are donkeys, that we are poor beasts under the load of a heavy burden.
[1595]  Chapter thirty-four of Exodus, the record of Moses stay with God, covers three main subjects: feasting with the Lord and resting with Him, five conditions for enjoying the Lord, and God s infusion of Himself into Moses.
[1596]  In the two foregoing messages we covered the three feasts and the Sabbath and the five conditions.
[1597]  In this message, after a word of introduction and review, we shall consider God s infusion of Himself into Moses.
[1598]  We have seen that Exodus 34 is both a brief sketch and a conclusion of the preceding thirty-three chapters.
[1599]  If it were not important, it would not have been repeated.
[1600]  Verse 27 says, And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
[1601]  We may need to be reminded that the title of this message is Moses Stay with God.
[1602]  If we would shine with the Lord s glory, we also need to have a lengthy stay with God.
[1603]  Exodus 34:28 says, And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water.
[1604]  When the Lord told Moses to come to the top of the mountain to meet with Him, He said to him, No man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen on all the mountain; neither let the flocks and the herds feed before that mountain v. 3 . This indicates that when we meet with God, we should forget our possessions, our necessities, and even our family.
[1605]  AND THE GARMENTS FOR THE PRIESTS 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 35:1-10, 20-35; 36:1-7; 39:32, 42-43
[1606]  In this message we shall begin to consider a section containing five chapters, chapters thirty-five through thirty-nine.
[1607]  In Exodus 34 three feasts are mentioned: the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of ingathering.
[1608]  Although according to Leviticus 23 there were seven annual feasts celebrated by the children of Israel, only these three are mentioned here.
[1609]  In the chapter concerned with the recovery of the broken covenant, God does not mention all the feasts, and the first of the feasts mentioned is not the Passover.
[1610]  In the light of the foregoing let us now consider 35:1-3.
[1611]  When God was about to charge His people to make the tabernacle with its furniture and the garments for the priests, the first thing He told them to do was to keep the Sabbath.
[1612]  This means that before they worked in building the tabernacle they should rest.
[1613]  This corresponds to the record in Genesis 2:2 and 3: And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
[1614]  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
[1615]  The first thing man did after he was created by God was to rest with God.
[1616]  In chapters thirty-five through thirty-nine of Exodus we have a record of the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the garments for the priests.
[1617]  At other times we may experience Christ as the One judged by God for us, as the Christ who takes our place in judgment, as the One who is our Substitute to suffer God s judgment for us.
[1618]  We have pointed out that many Christians do not have anything of Christ to offer.
[1619]  But even if we do have Christ in many aspects as the materials, that is not yet the building.
[1620]  In order to have the building, we need not only the materials but also the skillful workers.
[1621]  In Exodus we have the record of God s revelation concerning the tabernacle and its furniture and also the record of the making of the tabernacle and its furniture.
[1622]  The first is God s commandment concerning the erecting of the tabernacle and the placement of the furniture and utensils.
[1623]  The second record describes how Moses did everything according to God s commandment.
[1624]  Here we see the contrast between God s viewpoint and our viewpoint, between God s end and our end. God begins with the ark of the testimony, and we begin with the altar of burnt offering.
[1625]  If we compare the books of Romans and Ephesians, we shall also see a contrast between God s side and our side, between God s end and our end. The book of Romans begins with our side, with the situation of fallen man.
[1626]  This ark is the ark of testimony, and this causes the tabernacle to become the tabernacle of testimony.
[1627]  What God wants is the ark of testimony in the tabernacle of testimony.
[1628]  Because we care for our salvation, we may not have any thought concerning God s testimony.
[1629]  Exodus 40:16 says, And Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him; so he did.
[1630]  Again and again the words as Jehovah had commanded Moses are repeated vv.
[1631]  It seemed to me that it would have been sufficient to say at the end that everything was done according to what God had commanded Moses.
[1632]  LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE THE ERECTION OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 40 THE SEQUENCE
[1633]  In 40:1-16 we have the commandments of the Lord to Moses concerning the raising up of the tabernacle, and in verses 17 through 33, the actual erection of the tabernacle.
[1634]  Regarding the erection of the tabernacle, we see the following sequence: the raising up of the boards v. 18 ; spreading the curtains and the coverings v. 19 ; placing the ark of the testimony into the Holy of Holies vv.
[1635]  20-21a ; putting up the veil to cover the ark of the testimony v. 21b ; placing the table in the Holy Place on the north side, outside the veil, and setting in order upon it the bread before the Lord vv.
[1636]  The term tabernacle in the Bible refers to something deep concerning God and His testimony.
[1637]  The phrase tent of meeting is positive; however, the significance is not as deep as that of the tabernacle.
[1638]  Remember that the word tabernacle points to something directly related to God s testimony and that the term tent of meeting points to something that is more outward, external, related to God s interest and move.
[1639]  According to 40:36-38, the cloud of Jehovah s glory became the guidance of the sons of Israel.
[1640]  When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people journeyed: And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.
[1641]  Verse 38 tells us that the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their journeys.
[1642]  But according to the typology in Exodus 40, apart from God s dwelling place there is no guidance or leading.
[1643]  There is also a second important comparison between the books of Genesis and Exodus.
[1644]  In Genesis an individual Israel was produced to express God and exercise His authority for Him.
[1645]  In Exodus a corporate Israel was produced to express God.
