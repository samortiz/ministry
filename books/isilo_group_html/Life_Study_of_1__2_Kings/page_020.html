BUILDING THE TEMPLE OF GOD<br>WITH HIS OWN PALACES</H2><P>In chapters six through eight we have an account of Solomon's building the temple of God with his own palaces. The temple was a type of Christ and also of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Beginning in the Four Hundred Eightieth Year<br>after Israel Came out of Egypt</H2><P>The building of the temple, the house of Jehovah, began in the four hundred eightieth year after Israel came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 1012 B.C. (6:1). How patient our God is! He brought a people out of Egypt with the intention to build up His kingdom and His home, the temple. But His elect did not cooperate with Him; therefore, He could not accomplish this until the time of David. This is why David was so pleasant to God; he was a man according to God's heart. God's heart was on His kingdom with His home. However, there was not a person who would take care of God's heart's desire until David. David was a man according to God's desire to build up a kingdom and to have a house built up for Himself on the earth. Although this building began in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, everything for the building up of the temple was prepared by David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. On the Ground of Mount Zion</H2><P>The temple was built on the ground of Mount Zion, which was called Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac (Gen. 22:2) and David offered his sacrifice to Jehovah (1 Chron. 21:18&#151;22:1; 2 Chron. 3:1). By this we can see that the Bible is a record concerning God's economy. Isaac was a type of Christ, who was crucified on the same mount where Isaac was offered to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. According to the Promise of Jehovah<br>Given to David</H2><P>Solomon's building of the temple was according to the promise of Jehovah given to David (2 Sam. 7:12-13; 1 Kings 5:5).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Kings &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
