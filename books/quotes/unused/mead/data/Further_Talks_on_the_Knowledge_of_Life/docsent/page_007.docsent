   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE WHO EATS THE LORD LIVING BECAUSE OF HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 6:53-56, the Lord said, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to see that whenever we eat the Lord s flesh and drink the Lord s blood, we are joined to the Lord Jesus in a very subjective way; He and we are in each other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 57 continues, As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. Translators of the Bible into Chinese rendered the phrase he who eats Me as he who eats My flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, the Lord meant that He desired us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the expression to eat Him may sound wild, it is exactly what the Lord meant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He who eats Him will live because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Has there ever been one who has actually eaten the flesh of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No. But we have all received the Lord Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must see that God desires us to take Him in as food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He gives Himself to us as food to eat because He desires to be digested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason God must come to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God were not our life, He could not be digested in us, joined to us, and mingled with us to become our inward constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD COMING TO BE MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING THE FOCUS OF HIS WORK IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to mingle with man, God has to come to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His coming to be our Savior, power, and wisdom does not reach His goal of mingling Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must first come to be our life, and then all these other things can be added.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these other matters depend on His being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His being our power is based upon His being our life, His being our Savior is based upon His being our life, and His being our everything is based upon His being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God were not our life, He could not be anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God being our life is a central matter; it is the focus of all His work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His being our power, healing, comfort, Savior, and even our Lord depend on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, if He were not our life, He could not do anything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since God being our life by being digested, mingled, and constituted into us is a central matter, we need to see more concerning this life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God Himself is life, but how many processes or stages are involved in His becoming our life?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In each of the processes, how is He identified?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to know all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From eternity, from the beginning, God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In eternity, the Father is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day, the Father, who is the source of life, was manifested among men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First John 1:1-2 clearly says, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the Son, and His name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gospel of John records that everyone who believes into the Son should have eternal life 6:40 ; the Son is life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Son, having passed through His human living on the earth was crucified and resurrected to become the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life and the Spirit are one; thus, the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 20 says that in the evening of the Lord s resurrection, He came to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that moment, the Lord who is the Spirit was with the disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord as the Spirit dwelling in the disciples was their life because the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows that the Father is life, the Son is life, and also the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>ONLY GOD S LIFE BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the universe, besides the life of God, all other kinds of life cannot be considered as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the universe there is plant life, lower animal life, higher animal life, human life, and angelic life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In terms of nature and principle, however, these different kinds of life cannot be considered as life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real nature and principle of life is that it is ever-living, ever-existing, indestructible, unchangeable, and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only God Himself is life because only God is eternal, ever-existing, unchanging, and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only God Himself is divine and eternal, and only God Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, only God s life can be considered as life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s life is the unique life in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only by having this life can one have life; without this life, one cannot have life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The life of God is in His Son Jesus Christ; hence, 1 John 5:12 says, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that with the Son, there is life, and without the Son, there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>GOD FLOWING INTO MAN TO BE MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for Him to enter into us to be our life, He must flow Himself out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If He did not flow out, we would have no way to contact Him, let alone receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If He did not flow out, He would have no way to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Genesis 2, immediately after speaking of the tree of life, there is mention of a flowing river vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, after speaking of life, the Bible goes on to speak of a river.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s coming to be our life is absolutely related to a river.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, this river flowed from the throne to Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a river of life flowing among men but not yet flowing into them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, He needed a second step, which was to go to the cross so that His flesh would be broken, just as the rock was cleft in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then from His inner being, life flowed forth, becoming rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life, originating from the one unique river of water of life Rev 22:1 , which is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Spirit is the Lord s transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord, as the Spirit, not only can appear among men but also enter into men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, John 7:38 says, He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From the innermost being of those who believe into Him flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then verse 39 continues, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself, has entered into those who believe into Him to become the living water of life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At this time we can say that God has truly entered into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the flowing out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God flowed out through the Lord Jesus and flowed into us; this is life.</S>
