<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Occupations that Do Not Increase<br />the Value of Goods</h2><p>With some kinds of money, it is all right to make it as a businessman, but not all right to make it as a friend. These are things that we can have no part in. In short, we can only deal with this matter by taking care of the principles; we cannot deal with it in detail. It is wrong to buy with a view to speculate. But if a man moves some goods from one place to another, it is a work of labor, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, if there is the need for bribery in the process of doing this, we are again faced with temptation. In choosing our occupations we should take the broadest possible way, and we should avoid dangerous bridges as much as possible, because with these bridges there is always the danger of falling, and the fall can be quite serious. Always remember that the mentality of a businessman is on making money. This mentality does not revolve around need, but around money. It is not a question of righteousness or unrighteousness, but a question of our occupation.</p><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Is an occupation with the insurance business all right? (Everyone smiled, but there was no answer.)</p><p>Watchman Nee: Today we should walk on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned. It is not worthwhile for us to stumble because of our occupations. If I am looking for a place to live, I will never settle at the border next to Siberia. It is foolish to do that, because I would be the first one to be shot if someone came across the border. The wise way is to settle far away from the border.</p><p>If we want to serve God, we cannot remain at the border. We can answer questions like Brother Weigh's a thousand times, and the problem will still not be solved. The safe way is to move a little farther away from the border. The main thing is that our occupations should not involve a mere increase in dollars; there should be an increase in the value of goods. Any work that is of a service nature is always more noble than work that is purely commercial in nature. A Christian should maintain a high standard in the occupation he chooses. We have to study the noblest way for money to be earned. There is a difference between running a woodcraft store and being a carpenter. A carpenter improves on something from nature, whereas a store owner merely sells wooden wares. The latter is commercial in nature. It is always wise to stand on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned.</p><p>Perhaps Paul did not have the time to sell tents himself. Perhaps Mark sold them for him. If that was the case, Mark would have been acting as an agent. This kind of business can still be considered permissible. If I go into some kind of manufacturing business with three or five brothers, and one of us works as the sales agent, this is different from pure buying and selling. Hence, we see the need of coordination here.</p><h2 class="head2">Giving Up Occupations that Contain Elements<br />of Danger or Temptations</h2><p>As for those occupations that contain elements of danger or temptations, we have to give them up. Some resignations involve time and cannot be completed right away. At any rate, it is wrong to take money from others' pockets. We have to settle the matter of occupation by taking care of the basic problem. All occupations should add to the value of goods. The world should see something added to it through my occupation. Works of a commercial nature increase money, but do not increase goods. If there is only an increase in wealth without an increase in goods, it is wrong. It is unjustified for us to take from society without giving back to society.</p>
