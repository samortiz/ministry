   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Eventually, we saw the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The compound ointment takes olive oil as a base compounded with four kinds of spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These five elements compounded together become one ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one hin of olive oil refers to God as the Spirit, and this divine Spirit is compounded with Christ's death, with the effectiveness of Christ's death, with Christ's resurrection, and with the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This compound Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Three of the Godhead are not three Gods; they are just one divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible reveals all of these things to let us know how God can be one with man and how man can be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, we Christians should live a life of God and man, the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we live as a man, yet we also live as God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His Godhead is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have His life and His nature, just as the children of a father have their father's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But none of the children have the fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the father of a family has the fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, God is unique and His Godhead is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot share in His Godhead, but we do have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are participating in this divine life and divine nature so that we can live God, live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see this, our view concerning the Psalms will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My burden is to try the best to help the saints in the Lord's recovery come out of the misled concept concerning the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be released from being misled and be brought into the central line of God's economy, which is to live Christ as the embodiment of God by the realization of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we are here as a man, but we are living the Triune God in our manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many today, however, would oppose us for saying that we live God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul was a man, but he told us that he lived Christ, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To live Christ is to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christian life is not a kind of improvement of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christian life is a transformed life, a life that transforms us into a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that this fellowship helps us to seek after God according to the proper revelation in the holy Word.</S>
