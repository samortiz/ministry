   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>g. Concerning Divorce</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 24:1-4 we have a word concerning divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a man married a woman and, having found some indecency in her, he wrote her a bill of divorce and sent her away, and she went to be another man's wife, and the latter husband despised her and wrote her a bill of divorce and sent her away, the former husband could not return to take her again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, if the latter husband died, the former husband could not take her again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a thing was an abomination before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's people must fear Him in doing all things, for He wants to see that His people are pure and decent in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word indecency in 24:1 is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Indecency kills marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we all must avoid every kind of indecency.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has created us male and female, and there is a big difference between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In her conduct, a sister should always be mindful of the fact that she is a female.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, a sister, whether married or single, should not talk too freely with a brother or sit too closely to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the sisters should avoid indecency in the matter of dress, not clothing themselves in an indecent manner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The purpose of clothing is not primarily to protect us from the cold but to cover our nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God's people, we should be a testimony to Him even in the way we clothe ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the sisters avoid indecency, they will preserve themselves and maintain their status as females.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the sake of a proper married life, we must avoid all indecency.</S>
