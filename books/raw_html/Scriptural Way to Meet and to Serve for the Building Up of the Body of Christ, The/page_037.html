 <h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST BY PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>The best way to eat Christ is to pray-read His Word (Jer. 15:16). To pray-read is to masticate Him. This compound word <em>pray-read</em> was also invented by us. We knew very little about pray-reading before 1966. Although we did not have this term among us until 1966, some of the saints in the past centuries at various times did practice the reading of the holy Word in the same way as what we call pray-reading. The churches on the island of Taiwan first began to practice pray-reading in 1966. The news of it reached the west coast of the United States, and the church in San Francisco was the first church in the United States to practice it. The church in Los Angeles soon followed. One night in a prayer meeting of the church in Los Angeles, the saints pray-read all six chapters of the book of Ephesians. I was not in the meeting, but I heard the news while I was away visiting another city. I was told that the saints were very excited and that the meeting was quite high. They really enjoyed the Word through pray-reading. To pray-read the Word is to enjoy the Triune God who is embodied in the Word (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST TO MINISTER CHRIST<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Today the new way to meet and to serve is to minister Christ to people, which is to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen people to enlarge the Body of Christ, that is, to make the Body of Christ bigger and bigger. How could we have this kind of meeting? The way to have this kind of meeting is to come with our rich enjoyment of the riches of Christ and to speak this enjoyment. Then there will be an exhibition, a display, of all the riches of Christ. To do this we must enjoy Christ every day and all day. Then whenever we come together, each one will have something of Christ to present by speaking (1 Cor. 14:26). Nothing can replace this kind of meeting. In order to have the new way to meet and to serve, there is definitely the need of the enjoyment of Christ. To merely listen to messages without eating Christ for our enjoyment will result in death.</p>
<p>Many Christians today are starving for spiritual food. This is the reason that some of the churches in the United States attracted many &ldquo;church travelers.&rdquo; These &ldquo;church travelers&rdquo; are people who may have been in a particular denomination, but they became dissatisfied with it and began to travel from church to church seeking spiritual nourishment. Eventually, a number of these &ldquo;church travelers&rdquo; reached Elden Hall in Los Angeles as well as other meetings of the local churches in other places, and they were gained by the Lord, not by teaching but by feeding. They testified that the church life was what they were searching for; formerly they had been hungry, and now they were full. Their experience was like the testimony of the blind man in John 9:25: &ldquo;One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo; Many people came into the meetings in Elden Hall around 1970 and were fed. There was something in the meetings which was good for food; it was something which fit their inner taste, making them happy. This is the kind of meeting we need and the kind of meeting the Lord is going to recover. Therefore, we must be stirred up to be an enjoyer, a good eater, of Jesus Christ. We must be very healthy in our eating. All the eaters of Jesus will be speakers of Jesus in the meetings. We will speak Jesus, speak out Jesus, and speak forth Jesus. Then we will have rich meetings that feed the hungry people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT FAITH</h2>
<p>The first basic element of the New Testament faith is that Christ is life to His believers (John 3:15-16). Christ is also the life supply to His believers as the bread of life (6:48). Since Christ is our life and life supply, we need to enjoy Christ.</p>
