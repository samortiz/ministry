<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The First Seven Weeks&#151;Forty-nine Years&#151;<br>Being for the Rebuilding of Jerusalem<br>and Being Fulfilled</H2><P>Now we need to see the sections into which the seventy weeks are divided. The first seven weeks&#151;forty-nine years&#151;were for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and were fulfilled (Dan. 9:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Sixty-two Weeks&#151;<br>Four Hundred Thirty-four Years&#151;<br>Being to the Cutting Off (the Crucifixion)<br>of Messiah (Christ)</H2><P>The next sixty-two weeks&#151;four hundred thirty-four years&#151;were to the cutting off (the crucifixion) of Messiah, Christ (Dan. 9:26a). History tells us that from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the year that Christ was crucified was exactly four hundred thirty-four years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Interval after the Sixty-two Weeks and<br>before the Last Week of the Seventy Weeks</H2><P>After the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks, there was an interval, the length of which is not revealed and in which was the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the sanctuary by the people of the prince (the Roman army of Titus) in A.D. 70; and the end of it would be with a flood, and there would be war even to the end; the desolations were determined (Dan. 9:26b). The interval after the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks is the age of grace and the age of the church. This is also the age of mysteries. In this interval, everything that God did, is doing, and will do is a mystery. In this interval Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). Revelation 10:7 says that these mysteries will be completed, finished, and over at the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet.</P><P>In this interval was the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus with the Roman army in A.D. 70. Josephus, the Jewish historian, tells of how Titus devastated Jerusalem and the temple. This was a fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy in Matthew 24:2 concerning the temple: "Truly I say to you, A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down." Daniel prophesies further that there will be war until the seventy weeks are completed. From the destruction of Jerusalem until today, there has been war after war.</P>
