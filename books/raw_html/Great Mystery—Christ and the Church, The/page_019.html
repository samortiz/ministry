        <h2 class="head2">The Growth of the Body<br />
Depending on the Increase of God</h2>
<p>The Body is the mingling of the Triune God with the believers. The Body needs to be built up. The building up of the Body of Christ is different from the building of a house. The building of a house consists of attaching one piece of material to another. The building of the Body depends on growth. Verses 13 through 16 say, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children...but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; This portion speaks of growth several times, because growth is building up. Growth does not depend on preachers; growth depends on every member of the Body, that is, every believer. When the element of God grows in every believer, the Body grows and builds itself up in love. Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; The growth of the Body is the result of the increase of God in the Body. This increase is growth.</p>
<p>It may sound strange to speak of God increasing in us, but those with experience know that this is a precious and enlightening word. When we were saved, we received God, but we need more of God in us. This means that the element of God must increase in us. Some people may say, &ldquo;I was very spiritual a few months ago. I sang Hallelujahs every day and did not lose my temper, but now I am very low. I cannot rise up; I am no longer buoyant within. Therefore, I dare not say that the element of God has increased within me. Maybe I had more of the element of God a few months ago.&rdquo; We need to see that once God enters a person, He will never leave. God increases, but He does not decrease. A brother may have been overcoming and then feel low a few months later, but the element of God within him has not decreased. Being low is only a matter of feeling; God remains unchanged in us. Once He comes in, He will not leave, and when He increases, He will not decease. With God there is only entering; there is no exiting. There is only increase; there is no decrease.</p>
<p>Christians have the mistaken concept that they have more of the element of God when they are overcoming and high and that God is no longer in them when they are low or lose their temper. A person with such a concept lacks understanding and experience. According to the Bible and Christian experience, God can only enter into man; He does not leave. He will not leave in this age, in the coming age, or in eternity.</p>
<p>We are grateful to God for increasing in us. As a result of His increase, we may grow in life together with other believers. This growing together is the building. The members of our physical body are not joined and knit together in the way that a house is built and constructed. The members of our body grow together in life. If the life in our body dies, the members of our body will also die. All the members of our body are joined together to be one body by our growth in life. This also applies to the building up of the church. The more a person grows in life, the more he will grow together with others.</p>
<p>We can testify that when we were new believers, we were zealous for the Lord, and attending the meetings gave us great joy. However, we were not adequately joined to the saints. Sometimes we do not dare to touch the new believers, because we are fearful that they are fragile like glass and can break. After a few years, however, when they are joined together with others in the church, there is no fear that they will break when they are touched. This shows that the divine life is growing in them. When life grows, we spontaneously grow together and are joined together with all the saints. This is the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE ONE NEW MAN<br />
WITH CHRIST AS ITS PERSON</h2>
<p>When all the members of the Body are built up together, the Body becomes the one new man. The church is not only the Body of Christ but also the one new man. A body needs life; it is not a body without life. A man, however, needs not only life but also a person. The church is the one Body of Christ and also the one new man. As the Body, the church takes Christ as her life; as the new man, the church takes Christ as her person. The manifestation of the new man depends on the believers taking Christ as their person.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:22-24 says, &ldquo;Put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; The secret to putting off the old man and putting on the new man involves a change of persons. In the past we lived in our old man, but now we must live in the new man. Hence, there is not only growth but also a change of persons. In order to be renewed, we need to allow the element of God to increase in us daily, and we also need a daily change of persons. In the New Testament to be renewed is to be transformed. When we are renewed, we are transformed. This is not the outward adjustment of character but the transformation of our inner being until we are the same image as the Lord within and without.</p>
<p>Verse 22 says that the old man is &ldquo;being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; In Greek the word <em>deceit</em> is a noun, not a verb. There is something called deceit. The old creation is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit. Verse 24 says that the new man &ldquo;was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; In Greek both <em>deceit</em> and <em>reality</em> are personified. <em>Deceit</em> refers to Satan; <em>reality</em> refers to God. Satan, who is called the deceit, is the person in our old man, and God, who is the reality, is the person in our new man. Satan is the deceit, but God is the reality. Whatever we do when we live in the old man is deceitful, because deceit is our person. But our person has changed. The Lord is our new person, and He is God. He is the reality, in which are righteousness and holiness. Righteousness is to be right with God and man in everything, not having anything unrighteous, unfair, or improper. Holiness is to be the same as God in nature and to be fully separated from everything common, that is, everything other than God. Hence, the church is not only the Body of Christ; the church is also the new man who takes Christ as her person.</p>
<p>There are three crucial points in Ephesians 4. First, the church is one Body mingled with the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Second, the Body is being built up by the growth in life, which depends upon the increase of God within the members. Third, the Body grows, is built up, and lives by another person to become the one new man, having the image of the Lord for His expression.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
