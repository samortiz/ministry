   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Process a. Not Using the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adam and Eve failed because they did not use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If Eve had turned to the spirit, there would have been no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our husband is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if we remain in our mind it means that we are assuming the headship, setting our mind to behave independently.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is awful and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that our husband is with our spirit and exercise our spirit accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even when your temper is stirred within you, you need to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although you may say that it is difficult to turn in such a circumstance, I would reply that in such difficult times it is all the more necessary for us to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not deal with your temper; turn yourself to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Learn to use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All Christians know how to pray and ask God to help them, but few of them know that they have a spirit to which they can turn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do have such an organ, and it has a wonderful function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since God is with our spirit, we need to turn to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we will learn to turn to our spirit and to exercise our spirit in every situation, the results will be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How do you know when you are using your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever you do a certain thing or contact a person without being with God it proves that you are not using your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regardless of what you do, if you are independent of God and not contacting Him while you are doing it, it proves that you are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Be assured that in such a case you will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must learn to contact God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we contact Him, we are in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as I walk, I am using my feet; as long as I see, I am using my eyes; and as long as I contact God, I am using my spirit, since my spirit is the organ by which I contact Him John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I see, it means that I am exercising my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, if I am contacting God, I must be exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is very precious in our daily walk, and we all must learn to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the first step in the process of man's fall was failing to use his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam and Eve did not contact God in eating of the tree of knowledge, but instead paid attention to things other than God, not taking Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Soul Being Exercised</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although man did not use his spirit, he did exercise his soul, signifying that man, represented by the soul, assumed the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times people refuse to pray or exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead they think, consider, and study.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They find it difficult to pray because their mind is too active, filled with many thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are unable to quiet their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of us are familiar with this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christian wives find it easy to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They talk to their husbands, friends, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if you ask them to pray, they find it difficult to do because their soul has been exercised so much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best lesson for us all to learn is to be quiet in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are able to stop our thinking and turn to prayer, it proves that we are a person walking with the Lord and living in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you are a talkative person, so active and strong in your mind, it will be difficult for you to calm yourself for a few minutes of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a person exercises his soul continually.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the process of the fall Eve exercised her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As she spoke with the serpent her mind was reasoning vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then her emotion was pleased with the fruit of the tree of knowledge v. 6 . Eventually, her will made a decision, deciding to take the fruit and eat it v. 6 . Our experience is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we are tempted by a particular matter, our mind reasons and considers, our emotion is aroused and comes to like the thing, and our will makes the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our mind, emotion, and will are the parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not trust any of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not trust your mind, emotion, or will, but turn your whole being to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As you are reasoning about matters, you must turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may use the example of shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As many brothers and sisters are shopping and see a particular item they want, they reason with themselves, saying, "I need this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is on sale now and the price is quite low.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is my only opportunity to buy it at this price."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more they reason about the item, the more precious it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have all experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, after we buy it and bring it home the thing soon loses its attraction and we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>While you were reasoning, the little serpent was present, stirring up your emotion, strengthening your will, and saying, "Go and buy it."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever you are in this situation you must realize that you are repeating Eve's history.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not laugh at Eve, for our own home is the garden of Eden and we ourselves at times are Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many sisters are not Martha, Mary, or Ruth they are Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although some sisters may select the name Mary, it seems that no one chooses the name Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What was Mary's characteristic?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was that she was calm and quiet in the presence of the Lord, not reasoning excessively in her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all must learn this basic lesson.</S>
