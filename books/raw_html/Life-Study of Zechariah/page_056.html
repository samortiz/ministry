<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) In the Great Tribulation<br>Two-thirds of Them Being Cut Off by Antichrist</H2><P>In the great tribulation at the consummation of the present age, in all the land of Israel two-thirds of them will be cut off by Antichrist in his persecution of the Jews (Zech. 13:8a; Rev. 11:2; 13:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) One-third of the Remnant Being Left in the Land</H2><P>One-third of the remnant will be left in the land and will be brought through fire and refined like silver and tried like gold by the persecution of Antichrist (Zech. 13:8b-9a). These will be those who are written in the book as the secret record (Dan. 12:1b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) They Calling on the Lord's Name<br>and the Lord Answering Them</H2><P>They will call on the Lord's name, and the Lord will answer them. The Lord will say that they are His people, and they will say that the Lord is their God (Zech. 13:9b). They will be saved into the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God, first in the millennium to be the priests to teach the nations and then in the New Jerusalem to participate in all the blessings God has ordained in eternity and for eternity. This is the household salvation to Israel.</P>
