   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 12:12 For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Col 2:19 Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body of Christ The Body of Christ Being the Expression of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament tells us emphatically that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>110 The function of the Body is to be the full expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot manifest our personality through any one member of our body the ears, mouth, eyes, hands, or feet alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Similarly, Christ cannot manifest His personality through any one member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It takes His whole Body to manifest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today He is revealing Himself through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, Christ was expressed individually; now He is expressed corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>111 Thus, not only is the Head Christ, but also the Body is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 12:12 clearly tells us that the Body is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>112 All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to become His Body, an organism, to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, He is not only the Head, but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>113</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body Growing with the Growth of God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have the light from the clear revelation in the New Testament, we shall see that the church is a living organism, the Body, with Christ as the unique Head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>114 In Colossians 2:19 Paul speaks of "holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>" Holding the Head is equal to abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, to hold the Head implies that we are not detached, or severed, from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To hold the Head is to remain in Christ without any insulation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The words out from whom in verse 19 indicate that something is coming out from the Head to cause the Body to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The growth of the Body depends on what comes out of Christ as the Head, just as the growth of a plant depends on what comes into the plant from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a plant does not absorb nutrients from the soil, the plant cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, if we do not receive what comes out from Christ as the Head, the Body cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Holding the Head is, therefore, equal to being rooted in Christ 2:7 as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore , in 2:19 Paul says that the Body "grows with the growth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>115 In Himself God does not need to grow; He is altogether complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in us, He needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The measure of Christ in us is too short, and the quantity is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need God to be increased within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>116</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must go on to ask in what way God gives the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God gives the growth by giving Himself to us in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since God gives growth in this way, we need to take time to absorb Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our contact with the Lord should not be rushed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are in a hurry, we shall not be able to absorb much of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to allow adequate time for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>117 If we would grow, we need to get into the Word, feed on the Word, and exercise our spirit to pray and to receive the Lord each day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>118 Every morning we need to take an adequate amount of time to absorb the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although even ten minutes is good, it is best to spend thirty minutes to enjoy Him at the start of each new day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you spend thirty minutes to absorb the Lord and to enjoy Him in the morning, you will not be bothered by negative things during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The "flies" and "scorpions" will not pester you, for the elements in the soil will repel them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>119 Do not spend so much time in your mind, emotion, and will, but spend more time in your spirit to adore the Lord, to praise Him, to offer thanks to Him, and to speak to Him freely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>120 Forget your situation, your condition, your failures, and your weaknesses and simply take time to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us open ourselves to the Lord, exercising our spirit to say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lord, I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I give You my heart and everything concerning this day."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>121</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
