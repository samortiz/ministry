Thank the Lord that the Bible, the holy Word, does give us such a view. However, in order to see such a view, we need to jump out of the limitation of the letter of the Bible. In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said, "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." We need to jump out of the letter and jump into the Spirit by prayer. By our looking to the Lord continually, the vision comes, and this vision brings in a view.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Purpose to Work Himself into Man</H2><P>In this view God is infinite and unlimited, having no beginning and no ending. This marvelously great God is a God of purpose. The greater a person is, the greater the purpose he has. Because we are living, we all have a purpose. God also has a purpose (Eph. 3:10-11), and this purpose is just to obtain what He desires to have. His heart's desire is His good pleasure (1:9). This good pleasure is revealed in Paul's writings, especially in the book of Ephesians. God's good pleasure forms the will of God, and for this will God held a council in His Divine Trinity to make a counsel (v. 11b). There is such a counsel in the whole universe. This counsel is that God intends to work Himself into man. This is a great matter. For the almighty, unlimited, infinite God to work Himself into the small, limited, finite man to be one with this man is a great thing.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Union in God's Relationship with Man &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
