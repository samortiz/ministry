<h2 class="head4">The Holy Place</h2>
<p>Proceeding inward from the outer court, a priest would enter the Holy Place, in which there were three items.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Table of the Bread of the Presence</h2>
<p>The first item was the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:30), also translated as the &ldquo;showbread table.&rdquo; On the north side of the Holy Place was a table on which was set the bread of the Presence. We know that the bread was displayed, as indicated by the translation &ldquo;showbread.&rdquo; This bread signifies Christ becoming our food, our bread of life. This is something displayed. A person who liked watching movies in the past can be cleansed from condemnation through the Lord&rsquo;s blood and washed from the defilement of movies through the Holy Spirit. As he begins to learn to pray and fellowship with the Lord, he will enter the Holy Place and be able to experience Christ as his power of life. He will even be able to testify that Christ is in him as the power of life, enabling him not to be defiled by earthly things. The power of life within him is displayed especially when he gives a testimony that is full of the power of life. This, however, is merely the visible bread of the Presence. This is a superficial experience; nevertheless, in comparison to the experience of the laver, it is deeper and more inward.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Lampstand</h2>
<p>The second item was the lampstand (vv. 31-39). The lampstand was on the south side of the Holy Place. The light of the lampstand shone forth and was expressed. The display of the bread of the Presence signifies the power of life, and the shining forth of the lampstand signifies the light of life. Both of these signify Christ in us as our life. The bread signifies that Christ&rsquo;s life satisfies and strengthens us, and the light shows that Christ&rsquo;s life shines on us as our light. Hence, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger&rdquo; (John 6:35), and also, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness&rdquo; (8:12).</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Incense Altar</h2>
<p>The third item was the incense altar (Exo. 30:6). The incense altar was on the west side of the Holy Place. The fragrance of the incense ascended upward, the bread of the Presence was displayed, and the light shone forth. Everything was visible and not hidden. The incense altar signifies Christ as our acceptance before God. This means that Christ is our acceptance before God and the power by which we live before God. Christ Himself is our strength, our light, and our acceptance. Through Christ we have the power to live the Christian life, the light to proceed on our way, and the means of being accepted before God.</p>
<p>Although the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar were found in the Holy Place, they still were manifest. Hence, they have both an inward and outward aspect. In contrast, the altar and the laver were entirely outward, being located in the outer court. All the offerings offered on the altar, as well as the bronze laver, were located in the outer court and were altogether visible. The Holy Place, however, was enclosed within the tabernacle. The three items in the Holy Place&mdash;the displayed bread, the shining light, and the ascending incense&mdash;speak of outward aspects of inward matters.</p>
<p>The Holy Place typifies man&rsquo;s soul, the outer man. Psychologists divide man into two parts: metaphysical and physical. The outward, visible part is physical and is related to the outer man, whereas the inward, invisible part is metaphysical and is related to the inner man. Thus, to say that man&rsquo;s soul is inward and man&rsquo;s body is outward is very logical. However, the Bible and our experience indicate that even though man&rsquo;s soul is something inward, it belongs to the outer man. What then is the inner man? Our spirit is the inner man. Only the spirit of the saved ones has the presence of God. God is in our spirit. This means that God is not in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies. Hence, the Holy Place typifies the outer man, the soulish man. A person who has not been saved for a long period of time has normally experienced Christ as life, light, and acceptance. It can be said that he is altogether in his soul and in his excitement. It is not bad to be in the soul, but it is superficial. In the Holy Place, Christ is our life, which is related to the bread of the Presence; Christ is our light, which is related to the lampstand; and Christ is our acceptance, which is related to the incense altar. However, all these aspects are still shallow; they are outward aspects of inward matters.</p>
