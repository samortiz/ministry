<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tendency to Keep Separate Territories</H2><P>Another hidden divisive factor is the tendency to keep separate territories. The Lord's work and move for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy is uniquely one. If we consider any region in which we are participating in the Lord's unique work as our particular territory, this will be a cause or a factor of division. Even the tendency to keep a separate territory should be uprooted. We should work for the Lord within His measure (2 Cor. 10:13-16), but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory. Our local work in our region should be for the Lord's universal Body. In the New Testament we cannot see such a thing as jurisdiction in the Lord's work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Way of Not Having One's Work<br>Mingled with Others' Work</H2><P>In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one's work mingled with others' work. The New Testament unveils to us that Peter's work for the Lord, mainly in the Jewish land, and Paul's, mainly in the Gentile world, were all for the one Body of Christ, without any distinction or separation. Rather, they were one in the carrying out of God's New Testament economy. The effect of Peter's work was realized in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:12), and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there (Acts 15:2, 4; 21:17-20a). This kind of fellowship, like the blood circulation of our physical body, helps the Body of Christ in the circulation of the divine life. It mingles the different pieces of our work for the Lord's recovery into one move. If our work is void of this kind of fellowship, this may develop into another factor of division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Hidden Expectation of Being<br>a Prominent Figure in the Lord's Work</H2><P>There was also the hidden expectation of being a prominent figure in the Lord's work. We cannot deny that this "gopher" of ambition was among us. If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem. The problem among us today is that a number of brothers have ambition but do not have the capacity. Ambition plus incapacity is a real problem.</P><P>If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition. But if they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts. If you desire to be a prominent figure and you have that capacity, you may become such a person. If all the churches are helped by you and all the churches listen to you, you may become a prominent figure. But if you do not have the capacity and you want to become prominent, this is when a problem comes in.</P>
