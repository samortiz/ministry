<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE<br>REALIZING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br>FOR THE CONSUMMATION OF THE BODY AND<br>THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE</H2><P>Only that part of the divine revelation which is found in the Epistles of Paul and of John and in Revelation will consummate God's economy to have Christ fully realized and experienced by God's chosen people. Perhaps not the majority but the minority, a small number, will realize Christ to such an extent. Then the Body can be consummated and the bride can be prepared. Then the time will be right for Christ as the universal Bridegroom to come back. But now it would be impossible. If we consider the situation today, we will see that nothing is ready for Christ's coming back.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RISING UP TO BE OVERCOMERS<br>BY TAKING CARE OF THE TWO SPIRITS</H2><P>I believe that the Lord wants us to rise up, to be stirred up. I pray that the Lord will burden all of us to go on in a particular way in this last part of the latter days to experience Christ according to how we have seen Him that we may be actually the parts of Christ's Body.</P><P>We have to believe that today God is doing something in His recovery. The spreading of His recovery in Russia has become quite an encouragement to me. It is a new start, a new scene. I believe that the Lord will do the same thing in the United States and in all of Europe because these nations are full of the descendants of Japheth, one of Noah's sons. The Bible indicates that God's consummation will, in principle, come through God's move among the descendants of Japheth (Gen. 9:26-27).</P><P>Now that we have seen this vision, each one of us must rise up to be an overcomer by taking care of the two spirits&#151;the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit and our regenerated human spirit. God Himself has been consummated, and He has also consummated us. All that is needed now is the application, which is just the consummated Spirit. If we take care of Him in our spirit, we will make it.</P>
