   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 10 Scripture Reading: John 14:2, 23; 15:4a, 5a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the three foregoing messages we covered the signs of the divine Trinity and of another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the divine Trinity, we covered forty-seven points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may also say that the Father is the Originator, the Son is the Accomplisher, and the Spirit is the Applier.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, we have the full realization of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we have seven important terms: source, expression, consummation, Originator, Accomplisher, Applier, and realization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TWOFOLDNESS OF DIVINE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we go on to consider the fifth sign, the sign of the abode, I would like to say a word concerning the twofoldness of divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With all biblical truths there is the matter of twofoldness; that is, with each truth there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even with God we can see twofoldness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, God is one; on the other hand He is three.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, God is triune, three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is divine, spiritual, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, with God there is a physical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though He is spiritual, yet there is a physical aspect with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel of John emphasizes the spiritual and divine aspects of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the book of Acts we can see the physical aspect of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As far as the spiritual aspect is concerned, Christ today dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He lives in us in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the indwelling of Christ is a mystery, it is nonetheless a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all can testify that we have the Son of God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, according to the book of Acts, Christ has ascended to the heavens in a physical way Acts 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His ascension was a physical event, and this event was seen by His disciples in a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They saw the Lord Jesus literally ascending to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What they beheld was not a phantom, but a man with a solid, physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is clearly portrayed in chapter one of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, according to Acts 3:21, Christ must remain in the heavens until the millennium, the time of restitution: "Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, physically speaking, Christ is no longer on earth, but in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, spiritually speaking, Christ dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we have two aspects the spiritual aspect and the physical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you speak to others about the Triune God dwelling in you, they may respond by pointing out that according to Acts 1 the Lord Jesus has ascended to the heavens and that according to Acts 3 He must remain there until the times of the restitution of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then they may warn you not to listen to anyone who teaches you that the Triune God abides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you encounter such a situation, you may say, "I certainly believe what is written concerning the Lord in Acts 1 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, I would remind you that the Gospel of John comes before the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us study chapters fourteen through seventeen of John's Gospel and see what these chapters reveal concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In particular, I would like to point out how in these chapters we have the source, the expression, the consummation, the Originator, the Accomplisher, the Applier, and the realization."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to fight for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In fighting for the truth, we do not trust fleshly weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, our trust is in the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we face opposition to a particular biblical truth, we need to remember the twofoldness of divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even our constitution as human beings is an illustration of the twofoldness of truth, for we have a physical part and also a psychological and spiritual part.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Medical doctors may study our physical body, but they may not know much about our psychological part and virtually nothing about our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This illustration indicates that it is not sufficient to know any truth in only one aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the paper on which this message is printed has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing can exist with only one side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, we have both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we had day without night, I doubt that any living thing could exist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for life to exist on earth, there is the need for both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This simple illustration points to the fact that there are always two aspects of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For instance, God is one and three, three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit of God is one and also seven Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, let us learn to study the twofoldness of the divine truth.</S>
