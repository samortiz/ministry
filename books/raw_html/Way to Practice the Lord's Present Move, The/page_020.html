<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO PRACTICE<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT MOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:26; 12:8; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You and thank You that You have raised up Your recovery in these final days. Thank You, Lord, that You have opened up Your Word to us and have unveiled to us so many truths concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Triune God being processed and consummated. Lord, we thank You for this time. Thank You for Your present move among us. Lord, we all are here. We want to tell You that we are ready. Lord, have Your way and have a free course among us and in each one of us. Spread Your move throughout the United States and throughout the entire world. Lord, gain the glory and carry us on. Do not let us go. We like to cooperate with You. Thank You for Your mercy and thank You for Your grace. Amen.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we want to see the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present move. We do not want to practice anything in the past or even anything practiced among us in the United States in the past twenty-three years. We want to practice the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move. The Lord is moving. Since Genesis 3 right after the fall of man the Lord began to move. He moved through Abel. He moved through Enosh. He moved through Enoch. He moved through Noah. He moved through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He moved through Moses, Samuel, David, and so many others in the Old Testament. He moved through John the Baptist. He moved through the very embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus Christ, and He moved through the apostles. He moved throughout church history through many of His loving seekers. The Lord is also moving right now.</p>
<p>Our God is neither dead nor dormant, but He is living and moving here and now. The Lord is still moving on this earth among us and with us. We have the assurance to say that the Lord is moving among us up to the present day. We are talking about the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s <em>present</em> move. Do not refer back to Elden Hall in Los Angeles. That was in the past. We are not talking about that, but about the Lord&rsquo;s present move. We all should be excited about His present move. Praise Him for the up-to-date way to practice His present move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1. TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY</h2>
<p>The first point of the up-to-date way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present move is to be filled! The way is to be filled, not with culture, religion, or education, but with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. We need to be filled with such a Spirit inwardly and outwardly, essentially and economically, for life and for work.</p>
<p>We should remember that we are not filled once for all. What Christ has accomplished is once for all, but what we have to experience is not. Time after time, day after day, morning after morning, evening after evening, all day long, we have to experience being filled with this wonderful, all-inclusive, processed, consummated Spirit for our entire lives. Every day in the morning the first thing we have to pray is, &ldquo;Lord, fill me afresh. Fill me, Lord. Fill me with Yourself as the consummated Spirit. I like to have You filling me up within and without. I want to be wrapped up and mingled with You.&rdquo; Every morning you should pray this prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Fill me up, Lord. Fill me up!&rdquo; I would like to hear many testimonies that even in your dreams you are crying out, &ldquo;Lord, fill me up! I need You to fill me up! Saturate, infuse, transfuse, soak and permeate me!&rdquo; Exhaust all the verbs in the dictionary to tell the Lord you want Him to fill you up. Do this every day. Tell the Lord, &ldquo;I was too dormant, but now I want to rise up by being filled with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forget about Elden Hall. Forget about yesterday&rsquo;s enjoyment of Christ. You need a fresh enjoyment. You need something up-to-date. The Lord was there in Elden Hall, but He is not there now. He is here presently moving in His recovery and He is in you. Wherever you are, He is in you, and He is in you right now. Do you believe He is repeating all the things He did in the past? He is not repeating anything. He is always going on and on and on. The Lord is working. He is moving.</p>
<p>Are you a person of yesterday? All of us should be people of today. Every day is a today. With some people every day is tomorrow and with others every day is yesterday. Some of the saints may say, &ldquo;How good it was in 1952 when I got saved!&rdquo; Even to look back to 1982 is to not be up-to-date. Do not look ahead to the future and do not look back to the past. We are people of today. Do not talk about your old experiences in the past. Talk about your experience today. Be filled today! Be filled, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today! Every day is a today! We do not have yesterday. We had yesterday, but we do not have it now. We will never have tomorrow. All the time we have is today. Every day is a today! When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will have today since every day in eternity is today. The only day we have is today. Be filled inwardly today! Be filled outwardly today! Be filled today!</p>
