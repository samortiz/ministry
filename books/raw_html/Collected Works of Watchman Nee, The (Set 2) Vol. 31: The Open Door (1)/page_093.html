<h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to my eldest brother, Jai-seng:</p><p>I received your card. I really thank and praise the Lord. When I see His doings, I know that the day of His coming is near. Hallelujah! The day we are hoping for will soon come. I hope we both will be faithful. The region of Han-Jiang has been blessed by the Lord. He has been saving sinners. May all the glory and praise be to our Lord Jesus Christ! All the brothers and sisters in Sien-You are rising up for the gospel. They are more willing to be responsible than they were before. The number of saved ones is still being blessed by the Lord daily. Most of them are elderly ones, rickshaw pullers, or illiterate country folk. There are barely enough seats in our gospel meetings every Lord's Day. From this we see that God is really not a respecter of persons! We have already made new chairs and have used them for two Lord's Days. We can seat one hundred twenty people, but we still have to add a few small chairs. Sien-You still needs a worker to come preach the gospel. Peace to you. Please greet all the brothers and sisters for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kwang-yao<br />February 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>Greetings:</p><p>I returned to the interior to work on February 2 with a few brothers and sisters. Thank the Lord that He was working with us. The result was that people were saved and edified. We were able to do a little, but if we had not had the Lord's presence, we would not have even been able to do that much! After we finished working in the first place, we were going to continue on according to our planned route, but it was as if we were "forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia....They tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them." Therefore, we were forced to return to Swatow. We are waiting for His leading concerning the future. May the Lord enable us to hear the Macedonian call. When the brothers were working in the interior, the political situation here was very tense. Thank the Lord, everything has eased off now. The brothers and sisters are all safe. I am reporting this to comfort you. My health has improved much recently. The Lord's grace is sufficient for us. This promise is a boundless treasure!</p><p>James<br />February 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Huang Ro-chen, Chungshan</h2><p>Thank the Lord, on the ninth of this month, Brothers Kaung, Luan, Chen, and Ho (Nai-yee) arrived safely in Ju-Hsiu Garden. They left Chungshan for Macao the day before yesterday. The brothers preached the gospel for a few days and edified the brothers and sisters. Even though it rained steadily for a few days, God's blessing was full. I never imagined that God would care for His children in this way and would grant us such help. By God's grace I was able to secure Mr. Luan's advice this time. He said that we have received enough help from X. I said that every person is different. He exhorted me to lead the newly saved ones into the knowledge of the resurrected Christ in life. This way they could be led by the Holy Spirit, even if they did not have much knowledge. He said that the three most precious words in his life are: (1) God's will is my life; (2) God's glory is my joy; (3) God's arm is my strength. I do not know how much praise and thanks I should render to God for all the grace He has given me.</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />February 16</p>
