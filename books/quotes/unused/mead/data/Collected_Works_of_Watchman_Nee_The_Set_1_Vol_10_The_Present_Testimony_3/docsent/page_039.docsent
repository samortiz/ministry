   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEVER STOPPING UNTIL ONE RECEIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S DEALING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only do we have to deal with our sins, and not only do we have to know God, but we need dealings in our environment as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, do you let everything that happens in your family go by freely?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you pray only once and then stop praying because you do not receive God's answer, you can never expect to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul surely was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He prayed once, twice, even three times to the Lord until the Lord answered his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are only willing to pray once, then you do not need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God does not answer you the first, second, or third time, you should pray ten times or a hundred times until God speaks to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Keep in mind that any hastiness is contrary to faith and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith is the most enduring thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God does not answer, you should be able to wait until you are one hundred years old.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abraham believed in hope in a situation that was against hope.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Elisha told King Joash to beat the ground with an arrow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Joash only beat the ground three times, and Elisha said that he could only win the battle over the Syrians three times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he would have beaten it several times more, he could have destroyed the Syrians 2 Kings 13:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our prayers should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot stop our prayers at two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mr. Usher said that prayers are like putting name cards on a balance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You put one gram of weight on one side and then put the cards one by one on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the first one or two cards, the other side may not move; perhaps, only after you have added the last card will the weight be offset.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prayer is the same; you have to pray once, twice, three times, again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps by the last time, the prayer will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we have to learn to deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our physical health, in our work, in our family, in every detail of our environment, we have to ask God to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I know a sister who is over sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She said to me that everything she encounters in her environment has something to do with her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked her, "Is this really true?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I thought that she only said this in her preaching and that the fact might not have been so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a brother had a cold, and she wrote to him: "What lesson have you learned from this cold?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I thought that it would be reasonable to learn something if he had a severe disease like intestinal flu.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But how could he learn a lesson from a small cold?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this brother received the help.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He replied, "I did not normally pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By your asking, this matter has come to my attention.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have been dealt with by God, and I have repented."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was another brother whose relative was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This sister again wrote and said, "You have to be responsible for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should not allow this sickness to go on."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consequently, this brother also received help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once she herself was sick in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Her co-worker was away in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She was out of money, and her cook also went home for some reason.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She prayed continuously, asking God, "Why does this sickness come upon me?", and God showed her that this was not from Him, but this was Satan's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She said, "If this is due to my own problem, I can remain sick.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if this is Satan's attack, let the sickness be gone."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She had been ill for four days with a high fever, but she stood up right after she prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At this time she wrote a song: "To the foe my word is always, No,' / To the Father it is Yes.'"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have this song in our hymn book.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When she finished writing this song, she went out to work, and her sickness was over.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Wherever she was, she had God's hand with her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She fully understood Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once she told me that everything would be all right if we really knew Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I could easily find Colossians 2:14-15 in the Bible, which says that Christ triumphed over everything on the cross, or Hebrews 2:14, which says that through death He destroyed him who has the might of death, or 1 John 3:8, which says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil, or Revelation 12:11, which says that the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But whenever I heard of Christ's victory from this sister's mouth, I always felt that with her there seemed to be a special meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I did not understand this, and I was bewildered all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once I stayed in her house and was very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time in addition to my sickness, I was really depressed in my heart because a few matters were still unresolved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She came to see me, and I told her my problems.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After every phrase that I spoke, she stared at me and said, "Christ has won the victory."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I said that I was not afraid of the outward sickness, but that whenever I thought about the inward problems that were not yet worked out, I broke out in a cold sweat, and I just could not bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She still said, "Christ has won the victory."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said, "You cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To the enemy you can say, Christ has won the victory.'</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To sin, we can trust in the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To sickness, we can say that Christ has borne our infirmities.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In all these things, we can say that Christ has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But this is my own fault; I have a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can you say Christ has won the victory?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But she still said, "Christ has won the victory."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then she read two verses to me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that moment I became fully clear inside and out.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On that day I realized what Christ's victory really meant.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Prior to this I had only the Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From that day on, I received the real knowledge from God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I also realized that the victory I used to know was a weapon of reed and that it was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On that day I realized how much Christ's victory includes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whether it be the enemy, sin, sickness, or personal business, Christ's victory covers them all.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>She knew Christ's victory through her repeated experience of God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>She knew God, so she was able to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today many believers have not paid enough attention to Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let me ask you: which book from among the sixty-six books of the Bible do you really know?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is a pity that most of today's Christians do not even understand one book in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But more pitiful than this is the fact that they are ignorant about the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you want to know God, you have to deal with God concerning your body, your family, and your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You should not let anything go by carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You have to pray until you have God's answer.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By doing this you will learn a lesson which the Bible alone cannot teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do this you will know the next time that you have to deal with God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you learn this time after time, you will really know God.</S>
