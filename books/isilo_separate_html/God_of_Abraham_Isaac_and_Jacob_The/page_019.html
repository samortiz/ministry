The first test was to see how much Abraham valued and treasured the land. After he learned the lesson of defeat in Egypt, he realized that Canaan was the only place of value, and he returned. After his return it was easy for him to exercise his fleshly hands to hold on to Canaan. Therefore, there was a second test. Genesis 13:5-7 says, "And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land." God showed Abraham that although he had obeyed half of God's commandment to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house, he had not yet obeyed the other half; he had not parted with Lot. Hence, God needed to discipline him through Lot.</P><P>Verses 8 and 9 say, "And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." Now Abraham knew that God's calling was only for him and not for Lot. Brothers and sisters, we must realize that those who have been called to be the ministers cannot bring along those who have not been called by God. Abraham saw God's calling for him to be a minister, and he said to Lot, "Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." He would not hold on to the land with fleshly hands; he was willing to let Lot make the choice.</P><P>On the one hand, Abraham had to fulfill God's calling. On the other hand, God had to teach him the lesson that there is no need to use fleshly methods to hold on to God's promised land of Canaan. We should take care to learn this lesson well. God gave the land to Abraham, but this does not mean that Abraham could hold on to it with his flesh. We must learn the lesson of trusting in God to preserve that which He has promised us. There is no need for us to try to preserve it with earthly means or fleshly energy.</P><P>This was the second test of Abraham. In the end he overcame, and he was able to say to Lot, "If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." He did not try to preserve anything with his own strength.</P><P>Genesis 13:10-12 says, "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where...Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan..." The best portions were chosen by Lot, while Abraham remained in Canaan. All those who know God do not vindicate themselves. If we truly know God, we do not need to vindicate ourselves. If God has given Canaan to us, there is no need for us to hold on to it with our fleshly hands. We have to learn to believe in God, trust in Him, and bear the cross. Although the result of Abraham's faith in God put him on the hilly terrain, he was nevertheless in the land of Canaan. Lot chose the plain but ended up in Sodom.</P><P>Here we see that Abraham had made some progress. From this time on, he began to shine! Verses 14 through 17 say, "And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee." Once more God established Abraham in the land. Humanly speaking, a portion of it seemed to have been taken by Lot. But at this juncture, God came and spoke to Abraham. There was no need for Abraham to stretch out his hands to do anything. Canaan was given to him by the Lord, and there was no need to preserve it with fleshly ways. Our vindication comes from our trust in God; it does not depend on our holding on to anything with fleshly means. May the Lord be merciful to us and deliver us from our own hands and our own ways.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord." Having passed the second test, Abraham made some progress. He moved to Hebron. We have to realize that God is after a total victory. While Lot was choosing the plain of Jordan, Abraham might have overcome outwardly, but might not have overcome inwardly. Perhaps outwardly he said, "If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." But inwardly he might have hoped that Lot would act according to his conscience and would not be so shrewd as to take the best portions. Yet God brought Abraham through; he did not just overcome outwardly, but also inwardly. He moved his tent and dwelt in Hebron. He had indeed overcome.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
