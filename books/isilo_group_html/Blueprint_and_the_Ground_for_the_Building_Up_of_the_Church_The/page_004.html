for Man&rsquo;s Transformation</h2>
<p>The third crucial point in Genesis 2 is the flowing river. Once the divine life enters into man, it becomes rivers of living water (John 7:38). The divine life within man is not inactive or stagnant; it is operative, lively, and flowing, just like a river. The issue of this flowing is transformation. Experienced gold miners say that many treasures are produced where water flows. The Bible reveals that gold, bdellium, and precious stones are produced where living water flows (Gen. 2:11-12). Man was made of clay, but by entering into man, the Triune God mingles with man. Hence, God&rsquo;s golden nature is added to man&rsquo;s earthy nature. Gold is a fundamental element; it is not produced through a process of transformation, but pearls and precious stones are produced through transformation.</p>
<p>Bible students acknowledge that gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature. When God&rsquo;s golden element enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life and nature, man is regenerated. After man is regenerated, transformation begins in order to produce &ldquo;pearls.&rdquo; Even though we are made of clay, we can become pearls because we are regenerated and transformed in the wound of Christ. First there is gold, then pearls, and then precious stones. From the day we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s life is in us, doing a work of transformation. This is the story of the precious stones. Precious stones are clay that has been transformed through high heat and pressure. Prior to the process of transformation, the base materials for diamonds and jade have no value, but through transformation they become valuable stones. From the moment we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s life is operating within us and leading us. At the same time God also raises up outward circumstances to discipline us. These two matters, one within us and one without, coordinate to consume us and press us so that we can be transformed daily and as a result become precious stones.</p>
<p>After God&rsquo;s nature enters into us, it causes our earthy nature to be transformed gradually into pearl and precious stones. This corresponds to what is revealed in Revelation 21. The New Jerusalem is pure gold (v. 18), its gates are of pearls (v. 21), and the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone (vv. 19-20). Verse 11 says that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and that her light is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone. The light of the city is like a most precious stone, and the city has God&rsquo;s glory, the expression of God. The appearance of the city is like a jasper stone, which is the appearance of God (4:3). The New Jerusalem is a jasper city; it is completely like God in appearance. This city is the result of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work on all those who are saved. The life of God enters into us with the nature of God and operates in us continuously. The result of this continuous operation is our being transformed into pearls and precious stones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Transformed Precious Materials<br />
Needing to Be Built Up</h2>
<p>The fourth point in Genesis 1&mdash;2 is that the gold, bdellium, and precious stones are truly valuable and useful only when they are built up. Genesis 2 speaks of a woman after speaking of the river and the three precious materials. This implies that these precious materials must be built up into a woman, a counterpart. Some may feel that this interpretation is arbitrary, but it is based on Revelation 21, which says that the New Jerusalem, a city built with these three materials, is a bride, a woman (vv. 2, 9-10). Hence, the man of clay is a corporate man who, by receiving the life of God into him, obtains the element of gold, which issues in his transformation into pearl and precious stones. The gold, pearl, and precious stones are then built up into a corporate woman as the counterpart and dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>The built-up city shows the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. The man Adam, whom God created in the beginning, typifies a corporate man who expresses God in His image and represents and rules for God with His dominion. At the end of Revelation the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and is like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal (21:11). This is to express God in His image. Furthermore, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, His slaves will serve Him, and they will reign with Him forever and ever (22:3, 5). This is to represent God with His dominion. The four crucial points in the first two chapters of Genesis have a full development and consummation in the last two chapters of Revelation. By receiving God as life, men of clay receive the element of gold and become pearls and precious stones through transformation; they are also built together into a city, which is God&rsquo;s counterpart and God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This marvelous city in God&rsquo;s image and with God&rsquo;s dominion expresses God and represents Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
