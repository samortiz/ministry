<p>Fifth, we should also learn to memorize the precious verses in the Bible. There are precious verses in almost every chapter or portion in the Bible. Whenever we come across these portions, whether it is a verse or a sentence, we should memorize it. Even if we are unable to accurately memorize every word, we should memorize the main idea. For example, the most precious portion in Genesis 1 is verse 26: &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; We should memorize this portion or at least memorize the main idea. Verse 1 is also very precious and is worth memorizing: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Words that are negative can also be memorized. For example, &ldquo;But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). All these verses are very precious and should be memorized.</p>
<p>Every new believer should memorize these precious verses. If we do not memorize them as a new believer, it will be difficult for us to memorize them later. For example, Psalm 1:1 reads, &ldquo;Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers.&rdquo; Even though I have read this verse many times, I always forget the sequence of this verse whenever I quote it. This is because I did not memorize it properly at an early stage. Therefore, new believers should form the habit of memorizing important verses once they begin reading the Bible. This practice is very beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Underlining</h2>
<p>Sixth, we should learn to underline. This is also an important aspect of reading the Bible. One should underline precious verses and portions that impress him. If one uses only one color for underlining, there is no problem in using red. However, it is better for new brothers and sisters to use several colors. It is best to use seven different colors.</p>
<p>The first color, red, should be used for the Lord Jesus and His redemption. We should underline all the important verses in the Bible that are related to the Lord Jesus and His redemption in red. Of course, this is not a regulation but simply a suggestion.</p>
<p>The second color, blue, should be used to underline all the heavenly things. Everything that is heavenly should be underlined in blue.</p>
<p>The third color, golden yellow, should be used to underline everything that is of God. In the Bible, gold symbolizes God&rsquo;s nature. Hence, it is best to underline God Himself and all things pertaining to God in golden yellow.</p>
<p>The fourth color, green, should be used to underline all things that are related to the Spirit and to life. Green is the color of life. For example, Genesis 1:2 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.&rdquo; This can be underlined in green. Another example is John 1:4, which says, &ldquo;The life was the light of men.&rdquo; This verse should also be underlined in green. Anything that is related to the Spirit and to life should be underlined in green.</p>
<p>The fifth color is pink. This color should be used to underline important things that are not related to the Lord, heaven, God, or the Spirit.</p>
<p>The sixth color, black, should be used for Satan. The preceding five colors represent positive things; black is reserved for Satan. Whenever we come across things related to Satan, such as the serpent, the great dragon, the devil, and so forth, we should underline them in black.</p>
<p>The seventh color, dark purple, is very close to black but has a tinge of red. This should be used to indicate sinfulness, the flesh, the world, darkness, etc. Anything that is not Satan himself but is something bad should be underlined with this color.</p>
<p>It is good to use these seven colors for underlining. Reading and underlining the Bible every day is very profitable. After reading the Bible through and underlining it, it will be much easier to read it a second time.</p>
<p>We should underline the Bible as we read it, but this is not compulsory. It is also not necessary to underline everything the first time we read through the Bible. We would be remarkable people if we could identify all of these seven items the first time we read through the Bible. This is not even possible. However, as we read the Bible, we may see Christ in a portion and underline it. A year or two later, we may see something more in the same portion and underline it. This type of reading is spontaneous and beneficial.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that underlining is not obligatory, and we should not be distracted by it. Mere underlining without prayer, reading, or pray-reading will simply be an exercise in underlining and not a reading of the Bible. We must realize that underlining is merely to help our reading of the Bible.</p>
<p>We should not underline in a careless and untidy way. It is best to use a ruler and underline in a neat and orderly manner.</p>
<p>If some prefer not to use seven different colors at present, it is right to use only four colors. There should be black to represent Satan, and the remaining three colors can be red, yellow, and blue. In any case, it is entirely up to the individual&rsquo;s convenience. It is always useful to have some markings in the Bible.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
