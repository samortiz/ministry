   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to go on to see why Christians should receive the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we have believed in the Lord and are baptized, why do we need the apostles as representatives of the Body to come and lay hands on us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. God Pouring Oil</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>on the Entire Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, let us explain briefly the Body of Christ and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please read 1 Corinthians 12:12-13 and Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christianity is truly peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is so peculiar about it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has to do with God gaining a man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This man subjected Himself perfectly to God; He absolutely represented God and absolutely lived out the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today God has made this man both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has poured out His own Spirit upon this man, Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God poured His Spirit upon Him and endued Him with the Spirit, God did not pour the Spirit upon Him individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He poured it upon Him as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's anointing is on the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus did not receive the anointing from God as an individual; He was standing in the position of the Head of the Body when He received the Spirit upon His head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, He was anointed by God for the sake of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why He is called the Anointed One, and we are also called the anointed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His name is Christos, while our name is Christoi Christians, Christmen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the Head, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not want to have one individual man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, He is after a corporate man the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In itself, the church on earth cannot satisfy God; it cannot carry out what should be carried out; and it cannot maintain God's testimony, because it does not have God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, God has to anoint the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the church receives the anointing, it can satisfy God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The anointing signifies God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's authority is poured upon the church through His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, God does not anoint one or two members, nor does He anoint all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God only anoints the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for God's children to know the Holy Spirit, they must first know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit is not given firstly to the Body but to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole Body receives the anointing because God has anointed the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is this clear?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a matter of a single member receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is neither a matter of all the members receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a matter of the Head receiving the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. Receiving the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>by Standing in the Position of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How then can we receive the anointing oil?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must stand in the position of the Body in order to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I stand in the position of the Body and take a proper place within the Body, the anointing will come to me spontaneously when it is poured upon the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The anointing is not given just to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible for me to ask for the anointing for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people are deprived of any blessing because they come to God alone, hoping to receive the Holy Spirit and the anointing by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember that the oil was poured upon Aaron's head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It flowed down to his beard and then to his garment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Aaron had a long garment which reached his feet and covered his whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the oil was poured upon his head, it flowed to the lowest part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today a person enjoys the anointing because of his position in the Body, not because of his condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you stand under the Head, the anointing will reach you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do not stand under the Head, the anointing will not reach you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Receiving the anointing is not a personal matter, nor a matter of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a matter of being in the Body and under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Body submits to the Head and stands on the proper ground, it will receive the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our spiritual walk, we need the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will not walk according to the flesh only when the anointing becomes our power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The anointing is not poured upon man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us remind ourselves of this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot act according to our own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need the anointing, but we cannot receive the anointing through asking and praying for it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is only as we stand in a normal relationship to the Body that we will receive the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must see that the Bible never speaks about the anointing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only the Head is anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when the Head is anointed, we as His Body are also anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The anointing was not poured upon Aaron's body but upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the anointing flowed from Aaron's head down to his garment and eventually all over of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only foolish ones will seek for an individual anointing or an anointing just for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must all submit to the Head and stand in the position the Head wants us to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only then will we receive the anointing.</S>
