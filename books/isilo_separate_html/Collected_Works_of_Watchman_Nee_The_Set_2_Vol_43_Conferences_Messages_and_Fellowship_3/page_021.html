God's goal is to have many sons (Heb. 2:10). We all know that a son is begotten rather than adopted. Your son should have your life. Only the ones we beget can be considered as our sons; the ones who are begotten through someone else's life are not our sons. God wants to have many sons. This means He must give us His life. God gave us His life so that we could become His many sons. This is what God has shown us in His Word. This is God's goal.</p><h2 class="head1">FORGIVENESS AND JUSTIFICATION BEING REMEDIAL</h2><p>However, God's goal suffered a great setback. Even though God wanted man to have His life, man not only failed to receive it, but he also sinned and fell. This complicated God's work. In the beginning God created Adam so that Adam's life would be like His. If God had accomplished this one thing, He would have reached His goal. But Adam sinned and fell, and he could not receive God's life. As a consequence, God must solve the problem of sin before He can dispense life to man. God has to eliminate the hindering sins before He can give life to man. Now God's work involves more. In addition to achieving His goal of having many sons with His life, He has to make up for Adam's failure.</p><p>This is why the Bible shows us the matter of forgiveness and justification. These things make up for Adam's failure. We should not think that once man's sins are forgiven, God's goal has been accomplished. After man has been washed of his sins, he has only returned to the original Adamic state in the garden of Eden. Since Adam did not obtain the life of God at that time, God's purpose was still not fulfilled. We must realize that forgiveness and justification are remedial actions that deal with the negative aspect of man's fall. We are ready to realize God's goal and His work only after these negative things have been dealt with.</p><p>Now let us look at the first step the Lord Jesus took in saving us. We have already seen that God has to first deal with the sins that man has committed. He has to remove the things that are hindering man before He can give man other things. If you want to come into a house when the door is shut, you must first open the door. Entering the house is the goal; opening the door is not the goal. But if the door is not opened, there is no way for one to enter in. If we want to be sons of God, we must first be forgiven of our sins. But this is not God's goal. This is only the removal of obstacles for the purpose of receiving God's life. Tonight we will consider the matters of forgiveness and justification on the negative side. Perhaps all of us here are saved and are very familiar with these matters already. But regardless of how familiar we may be with them, we still need a review.</p><h2 class="head1">SINS BEING BEFORE GOD&mdash;<br />NOT BEING BASED ON THE FEELING<br />OF THE CONSCIENCE</h2><p>Please remember that in the Bible, man's sins refer to sins he has committed before God. They do not refer to the sins that one has in his own eyes. It is not a matter of feeling our sins or of our conscience condemning us of sins. The Bible says that sins are before God. What are sins? Sins are those which appear before God. David said, "Against You and You alone have I sinned,/And I have done what is evil in Your sight" (Psa. 51:4). He had not sinned against men. He had not sinned against Uriah or his wife. The One he had sinned against was God. It is very interesting that the only sins mentioned in the Scriptures are the sins before God. Most of us think that murder, arson, fornication, adultery, and many other evil things are sins. But God says that only the things He considers as sinful are sins. Regardless of whether they are clean or filthy, humble or proud, they are all sins. It is not a matter of what you say; it is a matter of what God considers to be sins.</p><p>Last month a new regulation came into effect in Shanghai: All cars must be parked on the left side of the road. If a car is parked on the right or any other place, there will be a five- dollar fine. I have a friend who has a shop on the right side of the road. If he parks his car on the left, it is inconvenient for him to get into the car when he leaves his shop because he has to make a big turn. He found it very troublesome to keep the new law. Therefore, he continued to park his car in front of his shop. Soon his license plate number was marked; the next day he received a ticket, and the third day he was summoned to court. The judge ordered him to pay the five dollars as required by the law. He said, "My shop is on the right side. It is logical for me to park on the right because I am parking my car in front of my own door. Is it wrong to leave things in front of your own door?" The judge said, "You may think that you are most logical, and you see nothing wrong in what you have done. But it does not matter whether or not you see anything wrong. In my eyes you are wrong, and my word says that you are wrong. If you still insist that you are right and continue to leave your car there, I will have to fine you again." Likewise, all sins in the Bible are sins before God. He determines whether or not you have sinned; it is not up to you to say whether or not you have sinned.</p><p>Many people are not clear about this. They always say that if their conscience does not feel any sins, they have no sin. The question is not how the conscience feels but what God sees. Even if you had a hundred consciences, you could still be wrong. Hence, sin is something before God; it is not related to the conscience. The conscience comes into play only after God has judged something as sinful. When we know we have sinned in the eyes of God, our conscience becomes bothered. It was very convenient for my friend to park his car in front of his door. But the judge said that he was wrong, and he was fined five dollars. After this incident, will he be at peace when he parks his car in front of his shop again? I can assure you that if does it again, as soon as he gets into his shop, he will ask, "Are the police outside?" This is because once his eyes are opened to the law, his conscience will begin to bother him. When we do not see God, we do not feel any sins. When God opens our eyes, we will see what God sees. Once we are enlightened, our heart is not at peace when we do the same thing again.</p><p>In order for God to save us, He must take away the sins we have committed before Him. Only after He has done this can He dispense His life into us. We must first deal with the sins that hinder us from receiving God's life before we can actually receive His life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
