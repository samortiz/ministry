   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In November 1948, Brother Nee had an urgent conference with us, the co-workers around him in Shanghai, to fellowship concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We needed the Lord's leading as to where we should stay in the coming days for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning of that conference, he said that he and the other co-workers had to ask me, Brother Lee, to go out of the country, and that all needed to bring this matter to the Lord and see how the Lord would lead each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By February 1949, Brother Nee had a second conference with the co-workers to decide that I, Brother Lee, had to go out of the country and that he and the other co-workers should stay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two months later from his training center, he sent me a cable, telling me to come to him and to hand over all the responsibility to the local leading ones in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I went to him and stayed for a few days, and then I was sent to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was in 1949 and was the last time I left mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in 1950 Brother Nee came out of mainland China to Hong Kong and asked me to go there to meet with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I went and stayed with him for one and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told him how the Lord had blessed the work in Taiwan and how within about one year, our number had increased nearly thirty times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee confirmed that I should go back and stay in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I was with him in Hong Kong, he told me that his burden for China was so heavy and that there were many churches still on the mainland that needed help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While Brother Nee was in Hong Kong, the church there was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This brought in a new start in the church life in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He charged me to lay the foundation of the church service there in Hong Kong for the church's building up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also made an arrangement for the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The publications were always under his oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he and I were in Hong Kong, he made the decision that there should be a bookroom in Taipei and a bookroom in Hong Kong to publish all of his books.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He himself would oversee the bookroom in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He charged me to take care of the bookroom in Taipei, and he arranged for Brother K.H. Weigh to take care of the bookroom in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said that all the books could be reprinted and that all three bookrooms would have a common copyright.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we began to reprint all his books for the need in all the places outside of mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My time in Hong Kong with Brother Nee was the last contact I had with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that time we only received news about him in an indirect way through his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His wife, Charity, went to the Lord in October 1971 in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee went to the Lord on June 1, 1972 while he was still imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This brief history shows how the Lord has moved among us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to continue to pray for the Lord's move and for the Lord's recovery on earth in this present time.</S>
