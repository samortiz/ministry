 <p><strong>WEEK 8 &mdash; DAY 3</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Matt. 28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acts 7:2 ...The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham....</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Person</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s person is simply God&rsquo;s being. Many more particulars concerning God&rsquo;s person are revealed in the New Testament than are unveiled in the Old Testament....God&rsquo;s way of revealing this is to present a little in one place and a little more in another place....These points may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be put together in order to form a complete picture.</p>
<p>In the New Testament God&rsquo;s person is revealed both in plain words and in parables and signs. [For our purpose here we shall only be able to cover several aspects in each category.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Plain Words:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The God who is dispensing Himself into us is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit certainly are not three Gods. God is one, yet He is triune.<sup>21</sup> Matthew 28:19 says that we need to baptize the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit....A person may have a first name, a middle name, and a last name, but these are all actually one name for one person. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three names, but the name of the unique Triune God. Matthew speaks of a wonderful person with a compound name&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit.<sup>22</sup> The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Another verse that reveals the Triune God is 2 Corinthians 13:14....The love of God is the source, since God is the origin. The grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God. The fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God with all His attributes.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 is strong proof that the Trinity of the Godhead is not for doctrinal understanding of systematic theology, but for the dispensing of God Himself in His Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people.<sup>24</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The God of Glory</h2>
<p>In the Bible glory is God expressed....When God is seen, there is glory....In Acts 7:2, as Stephen was testifying before the Sanhedrin, he said, &ldquo;The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham....&rdquo; The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel (Exo. 16:10; 24:16-17; Lev. 9:23; Num. 14:10; 16:19; 20:6; Deut. 5:24) and filled the tabernacle and temple (Exo. 40:35; 1 Kings 8:11). It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham and called him. His glory was a great attraction to Abraham. It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God (Exo. 29:43), and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4).</p>
<p>We all have been caught by the Lord in His glory. We have been captured by His glory. One day the God of glory came to us through the preaching of the gospel, and we were attracted and convinced and began to appreciate Him. During that time, the God of glory transfused some element of His being into us, and we believed in Him spontaneously....This can be compared to radium treatment practiced in modern medicine. The patient is placed under the X ray, unconscious of the beams that are penetrating him. We may say that God is the strongest &ldquo;radium.&rdquo; If we stay with Him for a period of time, He will transfuse Himself into us....Once God has transfused Himself into us, we cannot escape; we must believe in Him.<sup>25</sup></p>
