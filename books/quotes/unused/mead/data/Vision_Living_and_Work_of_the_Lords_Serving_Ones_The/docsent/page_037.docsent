   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN FOUR URGENT MATTERS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIFE-PULSE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based on our study of the Word, our experience in the work, and our study of church history, we can say that the Lord s recovery is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, how quickly the recovery advances and how widely it spreads depend on our cooperation with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we cooperate, the Lord s recovery will advance quickly and spread widely, but if we do not cooperate, the spread of the Lord s recovery will be slow, and its advance will be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the advance and spread of the Lord s recovery, there are four matters that require our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>PRACTICING THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we must practice the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever a church is raised up, even if there are only eight or ten saints, we should immediately practice the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The practice of the small groups does not depend on the number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three people can form a group, five people can form a group, or a group can be formed even with two people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many details related to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the co-workers the senior co-workers, the middle-aged co-workers, and even those who are just beginning to serve full time should spend time to study the practice of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From church history and from more than fifty years of experience in the Lord s work, we can see that since the time of the apostles, few believers have realized that the small group is the basic and excelling way to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s recovery has been among us for sixty-three years, and although we have practiced the small groups in the past, we did not stress them, nor did we take the time to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our shortage, and it has delayed the Lord for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it were not for this delay, the Lord s recovery would be in a different situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must see the importance of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not know how to have a small group, we do not know how to do the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, there is a need for learning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In every trade and in every academic field there is the need of learning and studying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must continually learn and study in order to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our practice of the small groups is only at the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was only in the past three to five months that we began to have a heavy burden for the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I regret that I have not led the brothers in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the younger saints begin to enter into the Lord s work, they will learn to serve in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The older and middle-aged co-workers will focus on helping the saints practice the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will be ninety percent of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By practicing the small groups, we will double our results with half the labor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DIVING INTO THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, we must dive into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The truth is our weapon; hence, we must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we began practicing the small groups, we led the saints to drop religion, rituals, regulations, and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, small group meetings do not have religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the most important matter in the small group gathering is to enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we cannot lead the saints to dive into the truth, the small group will not be a success.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if a small group meeting is successful, it will be empty and vain without the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must endeavor to lead the saints into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to do this, we must have a deep and broad knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>HAVING THE FIRE OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third, we must have the fire of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all must be on fire for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regardless of the age of the co-workers, whether they are in their seventies or in their twenties, all the co-workers must be on fire for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must preach the gospel earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PRODUCING FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fourth, we must produce full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in every locality should produce three kinds of full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church should produce some who will serve full time their whole life; young ones who, after graduating from college and before getting a job, will set aside three to five years to serve full time; and older saints who will serve full time after retirement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is a need for some who will give themselves to serve full time their entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It would be valuable also for young saints, after graduating from college, to set aside a period of time to serve full time before they begin working.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It would also be very precious for retired saints whose children are grown to give the rest of their lives to serve the Lord since they have many experiences in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The churches must promote and encourage the saints to produce these three kinds of full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we want the Lord s recovery to advance quickly and spread widely and to be established and rooted, we must carry out these four matters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In every place we must be diligent to practice the small groups, to dive into the truth, to preach the gospel, and to produce full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we all receive grace to focus on these four matters and pray desperately before the Lord for this.</S>
