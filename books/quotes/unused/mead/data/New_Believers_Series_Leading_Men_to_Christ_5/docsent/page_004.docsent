   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Praying Daily</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have to pray for those around you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is there no one who needs your prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How many colleagues do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How many neighbors do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How many relatives and friends do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Always ask the Lord to place one or two special persons in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord places a person in your heart, He intends to save this person through you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should write down his name in your record book and continually bring him to the Lord through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to set aside a fixed time daily for this work of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether it be an hour, half an hour, or a quarter of an hour, it must be a fixed time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is no fixed time for prayer, there will not be definite prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, there will not be any prayer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, always fix a time for prayers, whether it is a quarter of an hour or half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not be too ambitious; do not plan for two hours and end up not being able to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is more practical to set aside one hour, half an hour, or a quarter of an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Always fix a time to pray for those who need your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not relax.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a while, you will see sinners saved one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>G. A Few Examples of Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will mention a few stories here to show you how others have done this work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Boiler Worker</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once a boiler worker in a ship was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He asked the brother who led him to Christ, "Please tell me the first thing that I must do for the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brother replied, "The Lord will choose a few of your companions and put them in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will have to pray for them."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were more than ten persons working together at his place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He remembered one person in particular and prayed for him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That person found out about this, and he became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, an evangelist came by and preached the gospel to the men there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the meeting he stood up and said, "I want to believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The evangelist asked, "Why do you want to believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "A person has been praying for me for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have to believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The boiler worker had been praying for this man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although he did not like this in the beginning, the power of prayer overcame him, and in the end he accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Sixteen-year-old Youth</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A sixteen-year-old youth was working as a copy writer in a construction firm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The chief engineer of the company had a very bad temper and almost everyone was afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the youth was saved, he started to pray for the chief engineer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was afraid of the engineer and dared not open his mouth, yet he prayed earnestly for him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a short while, the engineer asked him, "I have over two hundred people in the company, but I feel that you are different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can you please tell me why you and I are so different?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The engineer was about forty to fifty years old, and the youth was only sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The young man answered, "I have believed in the Lord, and you have not."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The engineer immediately said, "I also want to believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The youth brought him to the church, and the engineer was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Two Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Europe there are guest houses which are open to strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are not hotels, but they receive travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once there were two Christian sisters whose house was open to travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes, as many as twenty or thirty would stay at their place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They noticed the luxury of the travelers' attire and the vanity of their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The sisters were bothered and wanted to win them over to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, there were many guests and only two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How could they win them over?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They decided to sit at the two ends of the room during the conversation and pray for the guests from each end.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the first day during the after-dinner conversation, each sister sat at one end, praying for the guests one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One prayed from one end, and the other prayed from the other end. They prayed for each and every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This stopped the guests' jesting and chatting on that first day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They asked themselves what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On that day, one person was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The next day, another lady was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One by one they were gradually all brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Prayer is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The first condition in bringing people to the Lord is intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must pray systematically, orderly, daily, and relentlessly, until our friends are saved.</S>
