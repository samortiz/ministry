<p>The Samaritan woman&rsquo;s contact with the Lord in chapter 4 illustrates a second principle. Here the Samaritan woman realized that she was thirsty and that the Lord had living water. Hence, she asked the Lord for living water. However, the Lord did not give her this living water immediately; instead, He asked her a question. She asked the Lord for living water, and the Lord asked about her husband (vv. 15-16). By asking about her husband, the Lord touched her sinful life; her sins were related to her husband. Hence, by asking about her husband, the Lord asked her about her sins, pointing out her sins. The Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;Do you want living water? You should hand your sins over. Do you want to be satisfied? You should give heed to your sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we see another principle. Knowing that the Lord can supply our need, we often go to the Lord and discover a need. When we see a need, we ask the Lord to meet that need. However, while we are asking, the Lord shows us our stains, faults, and failures; that is, He shows us matters that need to be dealt with. Many of us have had such an experience.</p>
<p>If a child asks me for something, I may ask him to hold out his hands to see whether they are clean. After he washes his hands, I may ask about his face. Sometimes he may need to wash several times before he is clean. This is often our situation when we go to the Lord in prayer. When we tell the Lord what we need, He tells us to go and call our &ldquo;husband.&rdquo; We tell Him of our need, but He points out our problems. This is another principle in drawing near to the Lord.</p>
<p>We often experience this principle after being rebuffed by Him for trying to give Him counsel or to direct Him. The Lord does not want us to pray for many things or for other people; He wants to reveal our own condition to us. However, when we ask Him to supply our needs, He points out our problems one after another. We often experience these two things when we draw near to the Lord and contact Him. On the one hand, He causes us to see our needs; on the other hand, once we become thirsty and cry out to Him, He points out our problems, faults, stains, and sins. We need to confess the things that He points out, the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; He asks us to bring, so that we can receive His supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on Spiritual Matters<br />
More Than on Physical Matters</h2>
<p>A third principle is seen in the case of the feeding of the five thousand in chapter 6. A great crowd contacted the Lord, and He performed a miracle in order to feed them. When the crowd returned the next day to be filled, the Lord said, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life&rdquo; (v. 27). The Lord was teaching the crowd to seek the food that abides unto eternal life instead of physical food. This is another principle: the Lord does not want us to seek or to put our hope in physical things when we contact Him in prayer.</p>
<p>Some brothers spend half an hour in the morning praying for physical things. Likewise, some sisters pray for the physical affairs of their spouse and children. The Lord may initially feed and care for those who draw near to Him in prayer in this way, but the Lord will eventually regard such a person as one who comes only to eat and be filled. The Lord will say, &ldquo;Do not pray for physical things; instead, learn to pray for the things of eternal life, for spiritual things.&rdquo; The Lord does not want us to always mention physical things when we contact Him; He already knows about these things. When we contact Him, we should focus on spiritual things, the things of life. This is to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. If we would focus on these things, the Lord will add the physical things to us (Matt. 6:31-33).</p>
<p>If we focus exclusively on physical things with the Lord, it will be difficult for us to touch His presence, and we will be rebuffed by Him in spirit. For example, it is very good that the saints spend time to draw near to the Lord in the morning, but whether they can touch the Lord during this time depends upon their focus. If we neglect spiritual matters and instead focus on physical things, it will be difficult to touch the Lord. Some believers who are students are anxious about their studies, and they pray concerning these in the morning. If they are encumbered by such matters when they draw near to the Lord, it will be difficult for them to touch His presence. Such seeking is not for eternal life or for spiritual things but for physical things. This is a matter of seeking to eat bread and to be filled.</p>
<p>Other saints focus on their sickness when they draw near to the Lord. They cannot get away from their sickness in either their thoughts or their prayers. They pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for causing me to benefit from my sickness. When will You heal me? How much longer must I wait?&rdquo; Such prayers are related to seeking to eat bread and to be filled. The Lord will answer such saints, saying, &ldquo;Work not for healing; do not pray that much concerning your sickness. Instead, pray for spiritual things, for things related to the eternal life. Forget about your sickness! Forget about eating bread!&rdquo; This is not easy to do.</p>
<p>Many saints pray only for physical things. Some young medical students, who are interns in a hospital, pray to the Lord in fear and trembling every morning, saying, &ldquo;Lord, do not let me do anything wrong today. Keep me from making a wrong diagnosis or from prescribing the wrong medicine. Do not send me any difficult patients or give me any heavy burdens.&rdquo; These prayers may seem good, but they are still related to eating bread and being filled. In response, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Work not for being a good physician but for eternal life. When you draw near Me, do not focus on these matters but seek spiritual matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some sisters cannot forget their household matters. They pray, &ldquo;Lord, make the servants obedient and the children study diligently, and keep my family safe from accidents.&rdquo; How many sisters do not pray concerning their family? These prayers are related to eating bread and being filled. The Lord would tell these sisters not to work for their household but to pray for spiritual things related to the eternal life.</p>
<p>Some saints may say that this word is hard and wonder what they should pray for. If the sisters who are housewives do not pray for their family, what should they pray for? If physicians do not pray for their medical affairs, what should they pray for? We think that the brothers with businesses should pray for their business, that students should pray for their studies, and that the saints who are sick should pray for their sicknesses. But if we do not pray for such matters, what should we pray for?</p>
<p>If we want to draw near to the Lord and contact Him every day, we must learn the lesson of not focusing on physical matters. We must set them aside in order to seek the Lord Himself, spiritual things, things of life, and eternal things. The Lord knows about our business, family, studies, and health better than we. Our heavenly Father knows everything we need. These are the things that the Gentiles, who do not know God, seek. However, we should seek first God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness and work for things that abide unto eternal life, not for things that perish (6:31-33; cf. John 6:27). This is a major principle in contacting the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Meaning and Purpose of Prayer &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
